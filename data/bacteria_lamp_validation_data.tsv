1	The aim of this brief report is to raise awareness of necrotizing soft-tissue infections caused by Clostridium tetani in intravenous drug users, highlight the potentially unique dangers of this infection in this specific patient population, and outline the course of treatment currently considered the standard of care. 
0	B. licheniformis HI169 positively influenced the larval final weight and growth rate when compared to the control. 
1	Conclusion: We report here for the first time that short-term clinical antibiotic use was associated with resistance mutations, collateral sensitivity, and positive in vivo fitness advantages to S. capitis during infection.
1	Here, we investigate the biocatalytic properties of the meso-butanediol dehydrogenase from Bacillus licheniformis DSM 13T (BlBDH). 
0	Here we describe a case of a 15-year-old child with Rett syndrome who presented with extreme gastric distension and fatal perforation in the setting of long-standing aerophagia and pathologic colonization with Sarcina ventriculi, a rare bacteria implicated in gastric perforation.
0	A potential flavor culture: Lactobacillus harbinensis M1 improves the organoleptic quality of fermented soymilk by high production of 2,3-butanedione and acetoin. 
0	Likewise, cluster II (strains J391T and J915) had the highest sequence similarity to Arthrobacter ruber (98.6 and 98.3 %, respectively) and Arthrobacter agilis (98.1 and 97.9  %, respectively). 
1	The oxacillin susceptibility rates of S. aureus were 36.6%/30.2% with FI/TI and vancomycin susceptibility rates for E. faecium were 54.1% and 49.5%, respectively. 
1	CASE PRESENTATION: We reported 4 cases of neonatal septicemia caused by Raoultella planticola. 
0	These findings indicated that F. prausnitzii, R. intestinalis and B. faecis improve the epithelial barrier integrity and limit inflammatory responses. 
0	In addition, we found that combining P. micra with other microbial markers, could further enhance test sensitivity. 
1	Mice gavaged with either P. mirabilis strain had more severe colonic inflammation. 
1	Slackia exigua is an obligate anaerobic coccobacillus associated with dental infection, but rarely causes extraoral infection.
0	Lactobacillus gastricus BTM 7 prevents intestinal colonization by biofilm forming Cronobacter sakazakii in Caenorhabditis elegans model host.
0	We investigated the antibacterial activities of C. maltaromaticum and C. divergens (n = 31) from VP meats by phenotypic characterization and genomic analysis. 
1	A rare case of massive pericardial effusion due to spontaneous rupture of Streptococcus anginosus group liver abscess. 
1	We present a patient with S. anginosus bacteremia who subsequently got diagnosed with metastatic colon cancer along with aortic and mitral valve endocarditis. 
0	The antibacterial efficiency was tested against Micrococcus luteus and revealed that surface protection was improved when lysozyme was grafted through the ligand-receptor interaction. 
1	Cronobacter sakazakii is an important opportunistic food-borne pathogen, and it can cause severe diseases with main symptoms including neonatal meningitis, necrotizing enterocolitis, and sepsis. 
1	Aerobic dichlorvos degradation by Pseudomonas stutzeri smk: complete pathway and implications for toxicity in Mus musculus. 
0	The selectivity of the developed method was examined with Micrococcus luteus (M. luteus), Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis), and Enterobacter aerogenes (E. aerogenes), which did not produce any significant response. 
0	Three different species of Lactobacillus; Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus gasseri, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus were individually supplemented orally (109 CFU/mL) to insulin-resistant SD rats for 12 weeks. 
1	Aztreonam-avibactam may represent a valuable option to treat S. maltophilia infections, addressing a major unmet medical need. 
0	In this pilot study, a four-week intervention with oral probiotic lozenges containing Streptococcus salivarius M18 was trialled in seven patients. 
1	The patients receiving cefepime-cefpirome or carbapenem therapy were infected by Acinetobacter nosocomialis (51.8%), Acinetobacter baumannii (18.4%), and Acinetobacter pittii (12.1%). 
1	Molecular epidemiology and risk factors of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infections in a Chinese teaching hospital. 
1	Haemophilus parainfluenzae (HPAR) is a Gram-negative bacterium that can become an opportunistic urogenital pathogen. 
0	Conclusion: This study provided the first report on the diversity of G. vaginalis in South African pregnant women. 
1	Here, we report a case of a pulmonary infection by Actinomyces odontolitycus and Veillonella atypica due to a dental caries in an immunocompetent 65-year-old man patient. 
0	Synthesis of silver nanoparticles prepared with a dextran-type exopolysaccharide from Weissella cibaria MED17 with antimicrobial functions.
1	This organism is most often isolated as part of normal oral flora, and patients with A. aphrophilus infection usually have an underlying periodontal infection or immunocompromised state allowing for infection. 
1	Shigella species and E. coli co-infection was detected in 2.4% of the children, specifically, 1.1% for EAEC/Shigella boydii, 0.5% for EAEC/Shigella dysentriae and 0.3% in each case of EAEC/Shigella sonnei, EPEC/Shigella flexneri and ETEC/Shigella flexneri co-infections.
