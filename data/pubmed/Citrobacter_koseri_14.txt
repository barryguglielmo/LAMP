BACKGROUND: Transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection is a rare occurrence but 
the most feared complication in transfusion practices. Between 2012 and 2017,
five cases of platelet concentrates (PCs) contaminated with the bacterial
pathogen Citrobacter koseri (PC-Ck) have been reported in France, with two
leading to the death of the recipients. We tested the possibilities of the
emergence of a PC-specific clone of C. koseri (Ck) and of specific bacterial
genes associated with PC contamination.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The phylogenetic network, based on a homemade Ck core
genome scheme, inferred from the genomes of 20 worldwide Ck isolates unrelated to
PC contamination taken as controls (U-Ck) and the genomes of the five PC-Ck,
explored the clonal relationship between the genomes and evaluated the
distribution of PC-Ck throughout the species. Along with this core genome
multilocus sequence typing approach, a Ck pan genome has been used to seek genes 
specific to PC-Ck isolates.
RESULTS: Our genomic approach suggested that the population of C. koseri is
nonclonal, although it also identified a cluster containing three PC-Ck and eight
U-Ck. Indeed, the PC-Ck did not share any specific genes.
CONCLUSION: The elevated incidence of PCs contaminated by C. koseri in France
between 2012 and 2017 was not due to the dissemination of a clone. The
determinants of the recent outbreaks of PC contamination with C. koseri are still
unknown.
