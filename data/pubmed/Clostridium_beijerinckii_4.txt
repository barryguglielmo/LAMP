In this study, puerariae slag (PS) was evaluated as a renewable raw material for 
acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation. To accelerate the hydrolysis of PS,
the method of ultrasound-assisted dilute acid hydrolysis (UAAH) was used. With
this effort, 0.69 g reducing sugar was obtained from 1 g raw material under the
optimal pretreatment condition. Subsequently, the butanol and total solvent
production of 8.79 ± 0.16 g/L and 12.32 ± 0.26 g/L were obtained from the
non-detoxified diluted hydrolysate, and the yield and productivity of butanol
were 0.19 g/g and 0.12 g/L/h, respectively. Additionally, the changes in the
structure of PS after different pretreatment methods were observed using SEM and 
FT-IR. UAAH resulted in more severe and distinct damage to the dense structure of
PS. This study suggests that the UAAH is an attainable but effective pretreatment
method, thereby is a promising technique for lignocellulose hydrolysis and
improve butanol production.
