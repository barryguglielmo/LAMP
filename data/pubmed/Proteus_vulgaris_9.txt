Background: Mobile phones (MPs) have become one of the most indispensable
accessories in social and professional life. Though they offer plenty of
benefits, MPs are prolific breeding grounds for infectious pathogens in
communities. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify the prevalence of
bacterial contamination and determine antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of
Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) from MPs.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from March to July 2019 on 126
students and 37 laboratory staff/clinical instructors' MPs from the Faculty of
Health Sciences, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Malaysia by a simple random sampling 
technique. Along with the questionnaire, a swab sample from each participant's
MPs was collected and transported to the microbiology laboratory for bacterial
culture as per standard microbiological procedures and antimicrobial
susceptibility test by the disc diffusion technique. Data were analysed by the
Statistical Package for Social Sciences Programme version 24.
Results: All of the tested MPs were contaminated with either single or mix
bacterial agents. Bacillus spp. (74.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 
47.9%) and S. aureus (20.9%) were the most predominant bacterial isolates, whilst
the least isolate was Proteus vulgaris (P. vulgaris) (2.5%). Oxacillin resistance
was seen in 5.9% of S. aureus isolate. A comparison of bacteria type and
frequency among gender showed a significant difference with P. vulgaris (P =
0.003) and among profession showed a significant difference with S. aureus (P =
0.004).
Conclusion: The present study indicates that MPs can serve as a vector for both
pathogenic and non-pathogenic organisms. Therefore, full guidelines about
restricting the use of MPs in laboratory environments, hand hygiene and frequent 
decontamination of MPs are recommended to limit the risk of cross-contamination
and healthcare-associated infections caused by MPs.
