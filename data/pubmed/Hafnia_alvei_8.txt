Hafnia alvei is a Gram-negative facultatively anaerobic bacillus that constitutes
part of the human gut flora. Until recently, H. alvei strains could be mistakenly
identified by conventional methods, miniaturisation or automatic systems as
members of the Serratia, Escherichia, Citrobacter, Yokenella, Obesumbacterium or 
Salmonella genera. Consequently, molecular techniques were required for their
definitive identification in the clinical laboratory. In addition, a new Hafnia
species, H. paralvei, has recently appeared, which undoubtedly includes many of
the strains reported in the literature as H. alvei. Alrhough H. alvei isolation
from human clinical specimens remains uncommon, the development of drug
resistance due to this species is emerging and it is likely that this organism
will gain increasing importance in the future. Moreover, although H. alvei shares
some virulence mechanisms with other Gram-negative enteropathogens, little is
known about the factors that contribute to its pathogenesis in humans. The
present article reviews the current identification methods, antimicrobial
resistance and virulence factors of this bacterium.
