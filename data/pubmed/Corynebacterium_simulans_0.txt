Corynebacterium simulans was first reported in 2000. Although it is a member of
the normal skin flora, some cases of C. simulans infection have been reported.
Other Corynebacterium spp. rarely cause chronic pyogenic spondylitis, and
pyogenic spondylitis caused by C. simulans has not been reported at all. Here we 
report a case of acute pyogenic spondylitis due to C. simulans. A 78-year-old man
with diabetes mellitus visited our hospital with a 3-day history of lower back
pain and fever. Blood culture revealed C. simulans and magnetic resonance images 
of lumbar vertebrae showed pyogenic spondylitis. He recovered after treatment by 
vancomycin for 9 weeks and was discharged home. No recurrence has been observed
for half a year. This is likely the first reported case of pyogenic spondylitis
by C. simulans. In general, Corynebacterium spp. cause chronic pyogenic
spondylitis, but this case showed an acute course.
