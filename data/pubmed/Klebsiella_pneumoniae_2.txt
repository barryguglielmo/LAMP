OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare clinical outcomes of patients with Klebsiella
pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Enterobacterales and those with
New-Delhi-Metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM)-producing Enterobacterales.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of all adult patients with
KPC- or NDM-producing Enterobacterales isolates in a 2700-bed tertiary referral
hospital in Seoul, South Korea between 2010 and 2019. The primary outcome was
30-day mortality after first isolation of KPC- or NDM-producing Enterobacterales.
The secondary outcome was the development of infection within 30 days by the
colonizing isolates, among colonized patients. We performed Cox regression
analysis for 30-day mortality and competing risk analysis for development of
infection.
RESULTS: A total of 859 patients were identified during the study period; 475
(55%) had KPC and 384 (45%) had NDM. Thirty-day mortality was significantly
higher in the KPC group compared with the NDM group (17% [81/475] vs 9% [33/384];
P<0.001). The KPC group developed infection within 30 days from the initial
colonization after first isolation more frequently than the NDM group (8%
[27/353] vs. 3% [10/295]; P=0.02). Multivariable analysis revealed that
independent risk factors for 30-day mortality were solid cancer (adjusted hazard 
ratio [aHR], 2.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.66─3.79; P<0.001), solid organ
transplant (aHR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.17─0.61, P<0.001), a high APACHE II score (aHR, 
1.11; 95% CI, 1.08─1.13, P<0.001), KPC-producing Enterobacterales (aHR, 1.69; 95%
CI, 1.02─2.79, P=0.04), previous carbapenem use within 3 months (aHR 1.86; 95%
CI, 1.26─2.75, P<0.001) and site of KPC- or NDM-producing Enterobacterales
infection at the time of the first culture (P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that KPC-producing Enterobacterales is
significantly associated with poorer outcomes compared with NDM-producing
Enterobacterales.
