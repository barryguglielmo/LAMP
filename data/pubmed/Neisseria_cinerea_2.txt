It is increasingly being recognised that the interplay between commensal and
pathogenic bacteria can dictate the outcome of infection. Consequently, there is 
a need to understand how commensals interact with their human host and influence 
pathogen behaviour at epithelial surfaces. Neisseria meningitidis, a leading
cause of sepsis and meningitis, exclusively colonises the human nasopharynx and
shares this niche with several other Neisseria species, including the commensal
Neisseria cinerea. Here, we demonstrate that during adhesion to human epithelial 
cells N. cinerea co-localises with molecules that are also recruited by the
meningococcus, and show that, similar to N. meningitidis, N. cinerea forms
dynamic microcolonies on the cell surface in a Type four pilus (Tfp) dependent
manner. Finally, we demonstrate that N. cinerea colocalises with N. meningitidis 
on the epithelial cell surface, limits the size and motility of meningococcal
microcolonies, and impairs the effective colonisation of epithelial cells by the 
pathogen. Our data establish that commensal Neisseria can mimic and affect the
behaviour of a pathogen on epithelial cell surfaces.
