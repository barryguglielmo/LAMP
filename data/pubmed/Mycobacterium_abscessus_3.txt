Actinobacteriophages are viruses that infect bacterial hosts in the phylum
Actinobacteria. More than 17,000 actinobacteriophages have been described and
over 3,000 complete genome sequences reported, resulting from large-scale,
high-impact, integrated research-education initiatives such as the Science
Education Alliance Phage Hunters Advancing Genomics and Evolutionary Sciences
(SEA-PHAGES) program. Their genomic diversity is enormous; actinobacteriophages
comprise many architecturally mosaic genomes with distinct DNA sequences. Their
genome diversity is driven by the highly dynamic interactions between phages and 
their hosts, and prophages can confer a variety of systems that defend against
attack by genetically distinct phages; phages can neutralize these defense
systems by coding for counter-defense proteins. These phages not only provide
insights into diverse and dynamic phage populations but also have provided
numerous tools for mycobacterial genetics. A case study using a three-phage
cocktail to treat a patient with a drug-resistant Mycobacterium abscessus
suggests that phages may have considerable potential for the therapeutic
treatment of mycobacterial infections.
