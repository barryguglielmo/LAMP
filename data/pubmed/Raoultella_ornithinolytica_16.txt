To date, blaNDM and blaKPC genes have been found predominantly in clinical
settings around the world. In contrast, bacteria harbouring these two genes from 
natural environments are relatively less well studied compared to those found in 
clinical settings. In this study, a carbapenem-resistant Raoultella
ornithinolytica strain, WLK218, was isolated from urban river sediment in
Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, China. This isolate was subjected to PCR and
antimicrobial susceptibility testing. PCR results showed that this isolate was
positive for both the blaNDM-1 and blaKPC-2 genes. The antimicrobial
susceptibility testing results showed that this isolate exhibited resistance or
intermediate resistance to all the antibiotics tested except for streptomycin
(susceptible) and cefepime (susceptible-dose dependent). The complete genome
sequence of the WLK218 isolate was then determined by using a combination of the 
PacBio and Illumina sequencing technologies. The de novo assembly of the genome
generated one chromosome and six plasmids. Among the six plasmids, the blaNDM-1
gene was carried on the IncX3 plasmid pWLK-NDM, while the blaKPC-2 gene was
located on the untypeable plasmid pWLK-KPC. This is the first report of an
environmental Raoultella ornithinolytica isolate co-harbouring the blaNDM-1 and
blaKPC-2 genes.
