Metagenome sequencing has not been used in infected bone specimens. This study
aimed to analyze the microbiome and its functions. This prospective observational
study explored the microbiome and its functions of DFO (group DM) and
posttraumatic foot osteomyelitis (PFO) (group NDM) based on 16S rRNA sequencing
and metagenome sequencing technologies. Spearman analysis was used to explore the
correlation between dominant species and clinical indicators of patients with
DFO. High-throughput sequencing showed that all the specimens were polymicrobial.
The microbial diversity was significantly higher in DM than in NDM. Firmicutes,
Prevotellaceae, and Prevotella were the most abundant microbes in DM. The most
abundant microbes in NDM were Proteobacteria, Halomonadaceae, and Halomonas
Prevotella denticola, Prevotella jejuni and Prevotella fusca had positive
correlation with the duration of diabetic foot infection (DFI_d). Proteus
vulgaris was positively correlated with the infection index, while Bacteroides
fragilis was negatively correlated. The microbial functional genes were more
abundant in DM than in NDM. Metagenome sequencing is feasible for the analysis of
the microbiome in infected bone specimens. G- bacteria and anaerobes are dominant
in DFO.
