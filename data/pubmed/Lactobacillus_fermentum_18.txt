Due to the interest in using probiotic bacteria in poultry production, this
research was focused on evaluating the effects of Lactobacillus fermentum
Biocenol CCM 7514 administration on body weight gain and cytokine gene expression
in chickens challenged with Campylobacter jejuni. One-hundred and eight 1-day old
COBB 500 broiler chickens were equally assigned to four experimental groups at
random. In the control group (C) chicks were left untreated, whereas in groups LB
and LBCj a suspension of L. fermentum was administered. A suspension of C. jejuni
was subsequently applied to groups Cj and LBCj. Body weight was registered, and
the individuals were later slaughtered; cecum samples were collected at 12, 36
and 48 h post-infection (hpi). The entire experiment lasted seven days. Reverse
transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to determine expression levels 
of IL-1β, IL-15, IL-17, and IL-18 at each time point. Pathogen-infected
individuals were observed to weigh significantly less than those fed with the
probiotic. Significant differences were also found in transcript abundance;
expression of IL-15 was downregulated by the probiotic and upregulated by C.
jejuni. The effects of bacterial treatments were time-dependent, as the
expression profiles differed at later stages. The present outcomes demonstrate
that L. fermentum both reduces the impact of C. jejuni infection on chicken body 
weight and regulates positively pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, which
ultimately increase bird well-being and improves production.
