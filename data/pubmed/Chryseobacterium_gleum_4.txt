Microbial biofilms are ubiquitous in drinking water systems, yet our
understanding of drinking water biofilms lags behind our understanding of those
in other environments. Here, a six-member model bacterial community was used to
identify the interactions and individual contributions of each species to
community biofilm formation. These bacteria were isolated from the International 
Space Station potable water system and include Cupriavidus metallidurans,
Chryseobacterium gleum, Ralstonia insidiosa, Ralstonia pickettii, Methylorubrum
(Methylobacterium) populi and Sphingomonas paucimobilis, but all six species are 
common members of terrestrial potable water systems. Using reconstituted
assemblages, from pairs to all 6 members, community biofilm formation was
observed to be robust to the absence of any single species and only removal of
the C. gleum/S. paucimobilis pair, out of all 15 possible 2-species subtractions,
led to loss of community biofilm formation. In conjunction with these findings,
dual-species biofilm formation assays supported the view that the contribution of
C. gleum to community biofilm formation was dependent on synergistic biofilm
formation with either R. insidiosa or C. metallidurans. These data support a
model of multiple, partially redundant species interactions to generate
robustness in biofilm formation. A bacteriophage and multiple predatory bacteria 
were used to test the resilience of the community to the removal of individual
members in situ, but the combination of precise and substantial depletion of a
single target species was not achievable. We propose that this assemblage can be 
used as a tractable model to understand the molecular bases of the interactions
described here and to decipher other functions of drinking water biofilms.
