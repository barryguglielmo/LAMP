Roseomonas gilardii is a Gram-negative coccobacillus identified in
immunocompromised pediatric patients. A 5-year-old male with a history of HbSβ
thalassemia status postsurgical splenectomy presented to the emergency department
with fever. Blood cultures grew R. gilardii at 63 hours, but the patient had been
discharged home at 48 hours. The patient was readmitted for repeat cultures and
initiated on meropenem for 10 days as Roseomonas spp. are often resistant to
third generation cephalosporins. R. gilardii is a rare cause of bacteremia in
immunocompromised patients. Clinicians should consider Roseomonas in slow growing
Gram-negative rod bacteremias, and consider meropenem as empiric coverage.
