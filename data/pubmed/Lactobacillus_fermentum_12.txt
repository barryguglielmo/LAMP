The composition of the bacterial community of Grana Padano (GP) cheese was
evaluated by an amplicon-based metagenomic approach (DNA metabarcoding) and
RAPD-PCR fingerprinting. One hundred eighteen cheeses, which included 118 dairies
located in the production area of GP, were collected. Two hundred fifty-four OTUs
were detected, of which 82 were further discriminated between dominant (32 OTUs; 
> 1% total reads) and subdominant (50 OTUs; between 0.1% and 1% total reads)
taxa. Lactobacillus (L.) delbrueckii, Lacticaseibacillus (Lact.) rhamnosus, Lact.
casei, Limosilactobacillus fermentum, Lactococcus (Lc.) raffinolactis, L.
helveticus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lc. lactis were the major dominant
taxa ('core microbiota'). The origin of samples significantly impacted on both
richness, evenness, and the relative abundance of bacterial species, with
peculiar pattern distribution among the five GP production regions. A
differential analysis allowed to find bacterial species significantly associated 
with specific region pairings. The analysis of pattern similarity among RAPD-PCR 
profiles highlighted the presence of a 'core' community banding pattern present
in all the GP samples, which was strictly associated with the core microbiota
highlighted by DNA metabarcoding. A trend to group samples according to the five 
production regions was also observed. This study widened our knowledge on the
bacterial composition and ecology of Grana Padano cheese.
