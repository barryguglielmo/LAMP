The study was envisioned to evaluate the decolorization of Reactive Blue 160
(RB160) dye by using indigenous microbes. Contaminated soil from textile dye
industry was collected from Noyyal river basin, Tamil Nadu, India. Potential dye 
degrading bacterial strain was recognized as Bacillus firmus by 16SrRNA gene
sequencing analysis. RB160 dye (500 μg/ml) was effectively degraded by B. firmus 
and toxicological analyses were performed with RB160 and their degraded product. 
Phytotoxicity revealed that degraded product of RB160 into non-toxic nature by B.
firms. Toxicity assays were carried out on root cells of Allium cepa and human
skin cell line (CRL 1474). Toxicity analysis of A. cepa and cell line signifies
that dye exerts toxic cause on the root cells and IC50 values of RB160 showed
toxic to human skin cell lines, while degradation products of the dye are
moderately less in toxic. Zebrafish embryo toxicity also evaluated by RB160 and
degraded product on phenotypic deformation, survival, hatching and heartbeat
rate. However, RB160 with concentration of 500 μg/ml decrease in the survival,
hatching, heartbeat rate and induced phenotypic alterations. In which, degraded
products exhibited significant development in zebrafish embryos as compared to
dye. Based on the studies effects of RB160 and capability of B. firmus can
effectively degrade RB160, and their degraded products were harmless to the
environments and aquatic system.
