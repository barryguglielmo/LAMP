OBJECTIVES: Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN), a gut probiotic competing 
with pathogenic bacteria, has been used to attenuate various intestinal
dysfunctions. Heparin is a sulfated glycosaminoglycan enriched in the human and
animal intestinal mucosa, which has a close connection with bacterial biofilm
formation. However, the characteristics of heparin affecting bacterial biofilm
formation remain obscure. In this study, we investigated the influence of heparin
and its derivatives on EcN biofilm formation.
RESULTS: Here, we found that heparin stimulated EcN biofilm formation in a
dose-dependent manner. With the addition of native heparin, the EcN biofilm
formation increased 6.9- to 10.8-fold than that without heparin, and was 1.4-,
3.1-, 3.0-, and 3.8-fold higher than that of N-desulfated heparin (N-DS),
2-O-desulfated heparin (2-O-DS), 6-O-desulfated heparin (6-O-DS), and
N-/2-O-/6-O-desulfated heparin (N-/2-O-/6-O-DS), respectively. Depolymerization
of heparin produced chain-shortened heparin fragments with decreased molecular
weight. The depolymerized heparins did not stimulate EcN biofilm formation. The
OD570 value of EcN biofilm with the addition of chain-shortened heparin fragments
was 8.7-fold lower than that of the native heparin. Furthermore, the biofilm
formation of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium was also investigated with
the addition of heparin derivatives, and the results were consistent with that of
EcN biofilm formation.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that heparin stimulated EcN biofilm formation. Both the 
sulfation and chain-length of heparin contributed to the enhancement of EcN
biofilm formation. This study increases the understanding of how heparin affects 
biofilm formation, indicating the potential role of heparin in promoting
intestinal colonization of probiotics that antagonize pathogen infections.
