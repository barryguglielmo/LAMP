A Gram-stain-positive bacterial strain, designated LMM-1653T, was isolated from a
uterus swab from a Holstein Frisian dairy cow in the frame of a clinical sampling
trial. The isolated strain, which showed a rod to coccoid shape, was
catalase-positive and oxidase-negative. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence
similarity, its closest relatives were Corynebacterium flavescens and
Corynebacterium argatoratense (96.50 % similarity each), suggesting that this
isolate represents a novel species. Strain LMM-1653T had a quinone system
consisting mainly of menaquinones MK-8(H2) and MK-9(H2). The polar lipid profile 
showed presence of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol,
phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol-mannoside as well as one
unidentified glycolipid and one unidentified aminoglycolipid. Moderate to minor
amounts of three unidentified glycolipids, β-gentiobiosyl diacylglycerol, one
unidentified aminoglycolipid and three unidentified lipids without a functional
group were also found. The cell wall contained meso-diaminopimelic acid and the
strain also contained corynemycolic acids. The fatty acid profile was
predominantly composed of straight-chain, saturated and mono-unsaturated fatty
acids, dominated by C18 : 1ω9c and C16 : 0. Since this isolate differs from the
nearest related established Corynebacterium species in its genetic and phenotypic
traits, a novel species named Corynebacterium endometrii LMM-1653T
(=LMG-31164T=CCM 8952T) of the genus Corynebacterium is proposed.
