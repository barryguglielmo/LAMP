Background: Intensive studies have failed to identify an etiologic agent in >50% 
cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Bacterial pneumonia follows
aspiration of recognized bacterial pathogens (RBPs) such as Streptococcus
pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus after they have
colonize the nasopharynx. We hypothesized that aspiration of normal respiratory
flora (NRF) might also cause CAP.
Methods: We studied 120 patients hospitalized for CAP who provided a high-quality
sputum specimen at, or soon after admission, using Gram stain, quantitative
sputum culture, bacterial speciation by matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization time-of-flight, and viral polymerase chain reaction. Thresholds for
diagnosis of bacterial infection were ≥105 colony-forming units (cfu)/mL sputum
for RBPs and ≥106 cfu for NRF.
Results: Recognized bacterial pathogens were found in 68 of 120 (56.7%) patients;
14 (20.1%) of these had a coinfecting respiratory virus. Normal respiratory flora
were found in 31 (25.8%) patients; 10 (32.2%) had a coinfecting respiratory
virus. Infection by ≥2 RBPs occurred in 10 cases and by NRF together with RBPs in
13 cases. Among NRF, organisms identified as Streptococcus mitis, which share
many genetic features of S pneumoniae, predominated. A respiratory virus alone
was found in 16 of 120 (13.3%) patients. Overall, an etiologic diagnosis was
established in 95.8% of cases.
Conclusions: Normal respiratory flora, with or without viral coinfection, appear 
to have caused one quarter of cases of CAP and may have played a contributory
role in an additional 10.8% of cases caused by RBPs. An etiology for CAP was
identified in >95% of patients who provided a high-quality sputum at, or soon
after, the time of admission.
