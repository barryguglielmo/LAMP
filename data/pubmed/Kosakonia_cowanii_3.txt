Exopolysaccharide has the activity of promoting plants growth. Herein, several
agro-industrial residues were used for EPS biosynthesis through solid-state
fermentation (SSF) using an EPS producing stain Kosakonia cowanii LT-1. Then the 
influences of cane molasses powder (CMP), NaNO3 and temperature on EPS
biosynthesis through SSF were studied using response surface methodology. Maximum
EPS yield (41.62 mg/gds) was obtained in a mixed substrate composed of cane
bagasse and broadbean seed capsule (2:1, w/w) supplemented with CMP (5.09%, w/w) 
and NaNO3 (4.16‰, w/w), which achieved about 30.43% cost savings for substrates. 
Transcriptomic analysis explained the mechanism of NaNO3 promoting EPS
production. Repeated batch SSF was performed eight times with 10% substrate as
the seeds of the next SSF cycle successfully. Therefore, the fermented SSF
substrate containing K. cowanii LT-1 and its EPS was applied in maize growth,
which could promote seed germination rate and growth vigor of maize. Hence,
fermented SSF substrates would be an ideal candidate for application as a plant
growth promoter in agriculture field.
