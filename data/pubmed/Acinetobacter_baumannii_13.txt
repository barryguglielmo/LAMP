In order to mitigate antibiotic resistance, a new strategy to increase antibiotic
potency and reverse drug resistance is needed. Herein, the translocation
mechanism of an antimicrobial guanidinium-functionalized polycarbonate is
leveraged in combination with traditional antibiotics to afford a potent
treatment for drug-resistant bacteria. Particularly, this polymer-antibiotic
combination approach reverses rifampicin resistance phenotype in Acinetobacter
baumannii demonstrating a 2.5 × 105-fold reduction in minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) and a 4096-fold reduction in minimum bactericidal
concentration (MBC). This approach also enables the repurposing of auranofin as
an antibiotic against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria with a
512-fold MIC and 128-fold MBC reduction, respectively. Finally, the in vivo
efficacy of polymer-rifampicin combination is demonstrated in a MDR bacteremia
mouse model. This combination approach lays foundational ground rules for a new
class of antibiotic adjuvants capable of reversing drug resistance phenotype and 
repurposing drugs against MDR Gram-negative bacteria.
