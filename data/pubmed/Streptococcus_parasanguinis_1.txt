The frequency of bacteremia in children hospitalized due to respiratory syncytial
virus infection (RSV) rarely exceeds 1%, but a recent study reported a 10% risk
of bacteremia. In this study, we set out to verify the frequency, usefulness, and
costs of blood cultures in RSV infections. We addressed the issue by reviewing
medical files of 512 children, aged 8 days-121 months, who were hospitalized
during January 2010 and June 2017. The RSV-related diagnoses included
bronchiolitis (390 patients), RSV pneumonia (65 patients), and bronchitis (57
patients). There were 212 blood cultures performed in 185 patients (36%). In 10
cultures (5.4%), the following pathogens were identified: Staphylococcus
haemolyticus, 4; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1; Staphylococcus hominis, 1;
Corynebacterium, 1 Streptococcus parasanguinis, 1; Rothia mucilaginosa, 1;
Micrococcus luteus, 1; and Streptococcus hominis, 1 case. However, all of these
pathogens were identified as a contamination of samples only. Therefore, both
positive blood cultures turned out in fact negative, and the patients having
either result of blood culturing showed no clinically relevant differences. The
total cost of blood cultures in the pediatric ward amounted to €1980. If
performed in each and every patient, the costs would have reached €5490. In
conclusion, the frank frequency of bacteremia in children with RSV infection,
with no sepsis, seems exceedingly low, which confirms the earlier findings. Thus,
blood culturing, generating high costs, is of negligible clinical value. The
study provides no evidence supporting a routine blood culture in case of children
hospitalized due to RSV infection.
