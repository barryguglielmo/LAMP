Human microbiota is heavily involved in host health, including the aging process.
Based on the hypothesis that the human microbiota manipulates host aging via the 
production of chemical messengers, lifespan-extending activities of the
metabolites produced by the oral commensal bacterium Corynebacterium durum and
derivatives thereof were evaluated using the model organism Caenorhabditis
elegans. Chemical investigation of the acetone extract of a C. durum culture led 
to the identification of monoamines and N-acetyl monoamines as major metabolites.
Phenethylamine and N-acetylphenethylamine induced a potent and dose-dependent
increase of the C. elegans lifespan, up to 21.6% and 19.9%, respectively. A
mechanistic study revealed that the induction of SIR-2.1, a highly conserved
protein associated with the regulation of lifespan, was responsible for the
observed increased longevity.
