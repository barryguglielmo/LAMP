Oral mucositis (OM) is a common complication of cancer therapy, however OM
management remains unsatisfactory. There is a growing interest in the therapeutic
potential of probiotics in OM due to positive findings of its use in intestinal
mucositis. This study aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of the probiotic
combination Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 and ATCC PTA 5289 strains in
chemotherapy-induced OM. Mice were divided into 4 groups. PBS/water and PBS/LR
groups comprised of mice injected with PBS intraperitoneally (i.p.), and were
given water or the mixture of L. reuteri (LR) DSM 17938 and ATCC PTA 5289 in
water respectively. The 5-FU/water and 5-FU/LR groups comprised of mice injected 
with 5-FU i.p., and were given water or L. reuteri DSM 17938 and ATCC PTA 5289 in
water respectively. Histopathological analysis revealed that the oral epithelia
of the 5-FU/water and 5-FU/LR groups were thinner compared to PBS/water and
PBS/LR groups. However, epithelial damage was significantly reduced in the
5-FU/LR compared to 5-FU/water group. Additionally, the 5-FU/LR group showed
reduced oxidative stress and inflammation in the oral mucosa. We further showed
that L. reuteri reduced oxidative stress through the nuclear factor E2-related
factor-2 (Nrf-2) signalling. There was no evidence of translocation of L. reuteri
systemically. This study demonstrated for the first time that L. reuteri
protected oral mucosa against damage induced by chemotherapy.
