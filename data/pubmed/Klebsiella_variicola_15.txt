The fruit fly species, Ceratitis rosa sensu stricto and Ceratitis quilicii, are
sibling species restricted to the lowland and highland regions, respectively.
Until recently, these sibling species were considered as allopatric populations
of C. rosa with distinct bionomics. We used deep Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)
technology on intact guts of individuals from the two sibling species to compare 
their transcriptional profiles and simultaneously understand gut microbiome and
host molecular processes and identify distinguishing genetic differences between 
the two species. Since the genomes of both species had not been published
previously, the transcriptomes were assembled de novo into transcripts.
Microbe-specific transcript orthologs were separated from the assembly by
filtering searches of the transcripts against microbe databases using OrthoMCL.
We then used differential expression analysis of host-specific transcripts (i.e. 
those remaining after the microbe-specific transcripts had been removed) and
microbe-specific transcripts from the two-sibling species to identify defining
species-specific transcripts that were present in only one fruit fly species or
the other, but not in both. In C. quilicii females, bacterial transcripts of
Pectobacterium spp., Enterobacterium buttiauxella, Enterobacter cloacae and
Klebsiella variicola were upregulated compared to the C. rosa s.s. females.
Comparison of expression levels of the host transcripts revealed a heavier
investment by C. quilicii (compared with C. rosa s.s.) in: immunity; energy
production; cell proliferation; insecticide resistance; reproduction and
proliferation; and redox reactions that are usually associated with responses to 
stress and degradation of fruit metabolites.
