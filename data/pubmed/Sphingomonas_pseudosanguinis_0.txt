Biodegradation studies of three- and four-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs) (phenanthrene [PHE] and fluoranthene [FLU]) were conducted using free and 
Ca-alginate-immobilized Sphingomonas pseudosanguinis strain J1-q (S1) and
Pseudomonas stutzeri strain (S2) in bench-scale sediment slurry reactors. In this
study, the effects of sodium alginate (SA) dosage on the characteristics of
immobilized bacterial beads were investigated. The results indicated a 3%
alginate concentration was optimal for immobilizing bacteria for PHE and FLU
degradation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the immobilized beads
showed the presence of honeycomb structures and abundant interstices in the
beads, which provided adequate space for microorganism adhesion and
proliferation. The biodegradation of PHE and FLU using both free and immobilized 
bacteria fit a first-order reaction model well. The degradation efficiencies of
PHE and FLU using immobilized bacteria were higher than those of free bacteria in
sediment slurry reactors. The removal percentages of PHE and FLU using
immobilized indigenous bacteria strain S1 after 42 d were 63.16% and 56.94%,
respectively, which were higher than the removal percentages of exogenous strain 
S2.
