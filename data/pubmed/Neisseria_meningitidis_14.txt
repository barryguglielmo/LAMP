Inherited C2-complement deficiency: variable clinical manifestation (case reports
and review).

Králíčková P, Andrýs C, Freiberger T, Krejsek J.

C2 deficiency represents the most frequent type of a complement deficiency.
Clinical manifestation includes infections caused by encapsulated bacteria
(Steptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis) such as meningitis, gonitis,
pneumonia or septicaemia. A causative treatment has not been available yet. A
prophylactic vaccination and/or a long-term antibiotics prophylaxis are
recommended. Here we report 2 patients from 2 unrelated families. The first
patient suffered from recurrent otitis in his childhood. He underwent
osteomyelitis, meningitis complicates with hear-loss, and one episode of
pneumonia during adulthood. The second index patient underwent uncomplicated
meningitis in his preschool age. He has been treated for recurrent upper-airways 
infections later. His sister has been completely asymptomatic. The deletion 28 bp
(c.841-849+19del28) in C2-gene was detected in all of them in homozygous form.
Our paper highlights the variability of a clinical manifestation in homozygous
carriers, ranged from asymptomatic cases to patients with history of severe
complications. The diagnosis is frequently made even in adulthood.
