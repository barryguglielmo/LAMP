A strictly anaerobic, Gram-stain-negative, non-spore-forming, non-motile,
non-pigmented bacterium, strain J115T, was isolated from human faeces. Cells of
strain J115T were straight rods, generally 1.8-3.0 µm, but could be up to 18 µm
long. Growth occurred below 2 % (w/v) NaCl and 2 % (v/v) bile. Strain J115T
produced acid from myo-inositol but not from d-glucose, d-ribose or d-xylose.
Butyric acid was the major end-product from myo-inositol. The genomic DNA
G+C content was 58.92 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene
sequencing indicated that the closest cultivated neighbours of strain J115T were 
Oscillibacter ruminantium GH1T (95.4 % similarity) and Oscillibacter
valericigenes Sjm18-20T (94.1 %). Strain J115T was also related to the
not-yet-cultured bacterium Oscillospira guilliermondii(92-93 % similarity).
Coherently with the 16S rRNA gene sequence results, the ANI scores don't have
units of strain J115T to O. ruminantium GH1T and O. valericigenes Sjm18-20T were 
73.37 and 73.24, respectively, while in silico estimations of DNA-DNA
hybridization were both 20.4 %, with confidence intervals of 18.2-22.9 % and
18.2-22.8 %, respectively. The major fatty acids were iso-C15 : 0 (24.2 %),
C18 : 0 DMA (18.4 %), anteiso-C15 : 0 (15.2 %) and C16 : 0 DMA (7.6 %). No
respiratory quinone was detected. Based on phenotypic features and phylogenetic
position, it is proposed that this isolate represents a novel species in a new
genus, Dysosmobacter welbionis gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain of
Dysosmobacter welbionis is J115T (DSM 106889T=LMG 30601T).
