To construct a saliva-based caries risk assessment model, saliva samples from 176
severe early childhood caries (S-ECC) children and 178 healthy (H) children were 
screened by real-time PCR-based quantification of the selected species, including
Streptococcus mutans, Prevotella pallens, Prevotella denticola and Lactobacillus 
fermentum. Host factors including caries status, dmft indices, age, gender, and
geographic origin were assessed in their influence on abundance of the targeted
species, which revealed host caries status as the dominant factor, followed by
dmft indices (both P < 0.01). Moreover, levels of S. mutans and P. denticola in
the S-ECC group were significantly higher than those in the healthy group
(P < 0.001 for S. mutans and P < 0.01 for P. denticola). Interestingly, the
co-occurrence network of these targeted species in the S-ECC group differed from 
that from the healthy group. Finally, based on the combined change pattern of S. 
mutans and P. pallens, we constructed an S-ECC diagnosis model with an accuracy
of 72%. This saliva-based caries diagnosis model is of potential value for
circumstances where sampling dental plague is difficult.
