Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius (Sii) has been identified as
predominant lactic acid bacteria in spontaneously fermented dairy products (FDPs)
in sub-Saharan Africa including Côte d'Ivoire. However, Sii belongs to the
Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex (SBSEC). Most SBSEC members are
assumed to be involved as opportunistic pathogens in serious diseases in both
humans and animals. A population-based cross-sectional survey, including 385
participants was conducted in Korhogo, northern Côte d'Ivoire, to identify risk
factors for Sii fecal carriage, including consumption of local FDPs. A structured
questionnaire was used to gather participant's socio-demographic and economic
characteristics, their relation to livestock and dietary habits. In addition,
fresh stool and milk samples were collected. The identification of Sii was done
using a SBSEC-specific PCR assay targeting 16S rRNA and groEL genes. The overall 
prevalence of SBSEC and Sii carriage was 23.2% (confidence interval CI 95% =
18.9-27.5) and 12.0% (CI 95% = 8.4-15.5) for stool, respectively. Prevalence of
Sii was significantly higher in consumers of artisanal butter compared with
non-consumers (57.1% vs 10.1%, odds ratio OR: 11.9, 95% CI: 3.9-36.6), as well as
in persons handling livestock (OR = 3.9; 95% CI = 1.6-9.3) and livestock primary 
products (OR = 5.7; 95% CI = 2.3-14.3). The closer contact with livestock was a
risk factor for Sii fecal carriage. Sii strains were isolated from fresh and
fermented milk products with a prevalence of 30.4% and 45.4%, respectively.
Analysis of Sii population structure through the SBSEC multi locus sequence
typing assay revealed a close relationship across human and dairy isolates,
possibly linked to a Kenyan human isolate. All these outcomes underline the
interest of in-depth investigations on the ecology, potential reservoirs and
pathways of contamination by Sii at the human-animal-environment interface in
comparison to yet to be collected data from Europe, Asia and the Americas to
further elucidate the various roles of Sii.
