The colonization of microorganisms and their subsequent interaction with stone
substrates under different environmental conditions encourage deterioration of
materials by multiple mechanisms resulting in changes in the original color,
appearance and durability. One of the emerging alternatives to remedy
biodeterioration is nanotechnology, thanks to nanoparticle properties such as
small size, no-toxicity, high photo-reactivity, and low impact on the
environment. This study highlighted the effects of ZnO-based nanomaterials of two
bacteria genera isolated from the Temple of Concordia (Agrigento's Valley of the 
Temples in Sicily, Italy) that are involved in biodeterioration processes. The
antimicrobial activities of ZnO-nanorods (Zn-NRs) and graphene nanoplatelets
decorated with Zn-NRs (ZNGs) were evaluated against the Gram positive
Arthrobacter aurescens and two isolates of the Gram negative Achromobacter
spanius. ZNGs demonstrated high antibacterial and antibiofilm activities on
several substrates such as stones with different porosity. In the case of ZNGs, a
marked time- and dose-dependent bactericidal effect was highlighted against all
bacterial species. Therefore, these nanomaterials represent a promising tool for 
developing biocompatible materials that can be exploited for the conservation of 
cultural heritage. These nanostructures can be successfully applied without
releasing toxic compounds, thus spreading their usability.
