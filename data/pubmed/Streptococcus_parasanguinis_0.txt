Streptococcus parasanguinis is a primary colonizer of dental plaque and an
opportunistic pathogen for subacute endocarditis. A putative fibronectin binding 
protein (Spaf_1409) that lacks both an N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal
cell wall-anchoring motif was identified from the S. parasanguinis FW213 genome. 
Spaf_1409 was abundantly present in the cytoplasm and also was found in the cell 
wall preparation and culture supernatant. By using an isogenic mutant strain,
MPH4, Spaf_1409 was found to mediate the binding of S. parasanguinis FW213 to
fibronectin. Inactivation of Spaf_1409 did not significantly alter the mass of
static biofilm, but reduced the resistance of S. parasanguinis against the
shearing force in a flow cell biofilm system, resulting in scattered biofilm. The
mortality in Galleria mellonella larvae infected with MPH4 was higher than in
those infected with wild-type S. parasanguinis. However, fewer viable bacterial
cells were recovered from larvae infected with MPH4, compared to those infected
with wild-type S. parasanguinis, up to 42Â h post infection, suggesting that the
infection by MPH4, but not the growth, was responsible for the elevated
mortality. The phagocytic analysis using flow cytometry indicated that Spaf_1409 
participates in the recognition of S. parasanguinis FW213 by RAW264.7
macrophages, suggesting that inactivation of Spaf_1409 intensified the immune
responses in larvae, leading to larval death. Taken together, the data indicate
that Spaf_1409 plays different roles in the development of dental biofilm and in 
systemic infections.
