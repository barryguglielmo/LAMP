Emergence and spread of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) are two 
of the major problems currently threatening global public health. In Nigeria,
interest in CPE is recent. In Sokoto, northwest Nigeria, there are no data on the
prevalence and mechanism underlying carbapenem resistance. In this study, we
aimed to investigate the presence of clinical carbapenems-resistant
Enterobacteriaceae isolates in two leading hospitals in Sokoto, northwest
Nigeria. A total of 292 non-duplicate Enterobacteriaceae isolated from clinical
specimens processed in the diagnostic laboratories of two hospitals between
January and June 2019 were collected. Of these, 129 (44.2 %) and 19 (6.5%) were
resistant to third-generation cephalosporin and carbapenems, respectively. RT-PCR
revealed that 10 (7.8%), 19 (14.7%) and 46 (35.7%) of the third-generation
cephalosporin-resistant isolates harboured bla SHV, bla TEM and bla CTX-M genes, 
respectively. The modified Carba NP test result showed that only 7 (36.8 %) of
the 19 carbapenem-resistant isolates were carbapenemase producing; among them,
bla NDM-5 and bla OXA-181 genes were identified in five and two isolates,
respectively. However, none of the carbapenemase genes investigated, including
bla VIM, bla KPC and bla IMP, was detected in the remaining carbapenem-resistant 
isolates, suggesting a non-enzymatic mechanism. This study reports for the first 
time, the emergence of CPE in Sokoto state and the detection of NDM-producing
Citrobacter freundii in Nigeria. The observed CPE in this study is a concern in a
country where alternative antibiotics are rarely available.
