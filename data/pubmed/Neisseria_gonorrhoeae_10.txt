OBJECTIVE: To examine the rinsing and gargling mouthwash practices among frequent
mouthwash users to determine if there are differences in use between gender,
sexual orientation and sex work status.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Data obtained from patients attending a sexual health centre located in 
Melbourne, Australia.
PARTICIPANTS: 200 frequent mouthwash users (four or more times per week), 50 for 
each of the following patient groups: men who have sex with men (MSM), female sex
workers (FSW), females who are not sex workers and men who have sex with women
only (MSW). Participants were observed and audio recorded using mouthwash.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Descriptive analyses were conducted to
calculate the median age, time rinsing and gargling, amount of mouthwash used and
proportion of participants who rinsed, gargled or both, as determined from the
audio files. Kruskal-Wallis H test and χ2 test were used to examine differences
between the patient groups.
RESULTS: Median age was 28 years (IQR: 24-33). During the study, most (n=127;
63.5%) rinsed and gargled, but 70 (35.0%) rinsed only and three (1.5%) gargled
only. Median time rinsing was 13.5 s (IQR: 8.5-22.0 s), gargling was 4.0 s (IQR: 
2.5-6.0 s) and the median total duration was 17.0 s (IQR: 11.5-25.8 s). Median
duration of mouthwash did not differ significantly between the groups (females
not sex workers: 18.8 s (IQR: 12.5-24.5 s); FSW: 14.0 s (9.0-22.0 s); MSM: 22.3 s
(13.0-26.5 s); MSW: 15.8 s (12.0-25.0 s); p=0.070) but males used mouthwash
longer than females (median 20.3 s compared with 15.5 s; p=0.034). The median
volume of mouthwash used was 20 mL (IQR: 15-27 mL). And most (n=198; 99.0%) did
not dilute mouthwash with water.
CONCLUSION: Over a quarter of frequent users do not gargle mouthwash at all (35%)
and used it for a substantially shorter period of time than it was used in the
randomised trial (1 min) where it was shown to be effective at inhibiting
Neisseria gonorrhoeae growth. Our findings suggest that many frequent mouthwash
users do not follow the manufacturer instructions for using mouthwash and may not
use mouthwash in a way that was shown to reduce the growth of oropharyngeal
gonorrhoea.
