A Gram-stain-positive strain, 8 H-2T, was isolated from faeces of Reeves' muntjac
(Muntiacus reevesi) barking deer in Taiwan. Cells of the strain were short
rod-shaped, non-motile, non-haemolytic, asporogenous, facultatively anaerobic,
heterofermentative and did not exhibit catalase and oxidase activities.
Comparative analyses of 16S rRNA, pheS and dnaA gene sequences demonstrated that 
the novel strain was a member of the genus Weissella. On the basis of 16S rRNA
gene sequence similarities, the type strains of Weissella oryzae (99.2 %),
Weissella confusa (97.8 %), Weissella cibaria (97.6 %) and Weissella soli
(97.3 %) were the closest neighbours to strain 8 H-2T. The concatenated
housekeeping gene sequence (pheS and dnaA) similarities of 8 H-2T to closely
related type strains were 72.5-84.9 %, respectively. The genomic DNA G+C content 
was 40.5 mol%. The average nucleotide identity and digital DNA-DNA hybridization 
values with these type strains were 70.2-75.4% and 25.1-30.1 %, respectively.
Phenotypic and genotypic test results demonstrated that strain 8 H-2T represents 
a novel species belonging to the genus Weissella, for which the name Weissella
muntiaci sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 8 H-2T (=BCRC 81133T=NBRC
113537T).
