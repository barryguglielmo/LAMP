Our case report describes a patient with a common presenting complaint yet an
uncommon infection. Our patient presented with a fluctuant breast mass diagnosed 
as a breast abscess. An aspirate sample was sent for culture and sensitivities,
which revealed the presence of Actinomyces turicensis and the anaerobe
Peptoniphilus harei She was therefore prescribed several weeks of amoxicillin and
metronidazole, and made a full recovery. There are only three case reports
describing A. turicensis as a causative organism for breast abscess, one of which
had also occurred in our department. One case also showed the additional presence
of P. harei Our findings reveal a growing need for increasing clinician awareness
of A. turicensis and the importance of aspirate sample culture and sensitivity.
