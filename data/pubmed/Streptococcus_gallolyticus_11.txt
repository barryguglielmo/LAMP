The aim of this study was to characterize staphylococci and streptococci in milk 
from Egyptian bovides. In total, 50 milk samples were collected from localities
in the Nile Delta region of Egypt. Isolates were cultivated, identified using
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry
(MALDI-TOF MS), and antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by the broth 
microdilution method. PCR amplifications were carried out, targeting
resistance-associated genes. Thirty-eight Staphylococcus isolates and six
Streptococcus isolates could be cultivated. Staphylococcus aureus isolates
revealed a high resistance rate to penicillin, ampicillin, clindamycin, and
erythromycin. The mecA gene defining methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus,
erm(C) and aac-aphD genes was found in 87.5% of each. Coagulase-negative
staphylococci showed a high prevalence of mecA, blaZ and tetK genes. Other
resistance-associated genes were found. All Streptococcus dysgalactiae isolates
carried blaZ, erm(A), erm(B), erm(C) and lnuA genes, while Streptococcus suis
harbored erm(C), aphA-3, tetL and tetM genes, additionally. In Streptococcus
gallolyticus, most of these genes were found. The Streptococcus agalactiae
isolate harbored blaZ, erm(B), erm(C), lnuA, tetK, tetL and tetM genes.
Streptococcus agalactiae isolate was analyzed by DNA microarray analysis. It was 
determined as sequence type 14, belonging to clonal complex 19 and represented
capsule type VI. Pilus and cell wall protein genes, pavA, cadD and emrB/qacA
genes were identified by microarray analysis.
