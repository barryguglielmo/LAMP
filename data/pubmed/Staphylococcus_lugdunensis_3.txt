Background: The 21st century has seen a wide range of diseases resulting from
zoonotic infections, of which bacterial infections have led to outbreaks of
food-borne diseases.
Aim: The study looks at bacterial pathogen carriage by farm rats and their
antimicrobial susceptibility, with the view of providing insights for
antimicrobial surveillance.
Method: Farm rats of Rattus rattus species where randomly collected alive from
farms in Al-Ahsa using food baits. They were anaesthetize with urethane within
4 h of collection and were unconscious for the collection of samples. Basic
bacteriological culturing methods were used for culturing of bacterial isolates
on selective media while the Vitek 2 compact automated system (BioMerieux, Marcy 
L'Etoile, France) was used for bacteria identification and antimicrobial
susceptibility test. Obtained data were analysed using chi-square and paired
t-test with significant difference between sensitive and resistance to
antimicrobial susceptibility taken at P < .05.
Results: Isolated Gramme-negative pathogenic bacteria included strains of
Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas oryzihabitans, strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
and Salmonella. For the Gramme-positive bacteria, 4 strains of Staphylococcus
aureus were encountered. Other Gramme-positive bacteria were coagulase-negative
Staphylococcal species (CoNS) as well as Staphylococcus lugdunensis. There was a 
100% resistance to the penicillins and a high resistance to imipenem (71%) by the
Staphylococcal isolates. Resistance was also high against the β-lactams by the
Gramme-positive bacteria isolates. For the Gramme-negative bacteria, there was a 
higher than 50% resistance by the isolates against the following antibiotics:
ampicillin (78%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (67%), cefotaxime (77%),
ceftazidime (67%), cefepime (78%), norfloxacin (67%), nitrofurantoin (67%), and
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (78%).
Conclusion: The results showed high antimicrobial resistance that will need
monitoring for control of spread from farm rats to humans.
