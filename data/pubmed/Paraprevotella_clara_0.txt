BACKGROUND: Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease is a multisystemic autoimmune
disorder characterized by granulomatous panuveitis. Gut microbiome has been
considered to play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease but whether the
alternation of gut microbiome was involved is unclear. This study was set up to
identify abnormalities of gut microbiome composition in VKH disease.
RESULTS: Depleted butyrate-producing bacteria, lactate-producing bacteria and
methanogens as well as enriched Gram-negative bacteria were identified in the
active VKH patients, as well as in VKH patients of Mix enterotype and Bacteroides
enterotype. Changes of gut microbiome in the VKH patients were partially restored
after an immunosuppressive treatment. The disease susceptibility genotype HLA-DRA
was associated with Bacteroides sp.2.1.33B, Paraprevotella clara, Alistipes
finegoldii and Eubacterium eligens. A microbial marker profile including 40
disease-associated species was established to differentiate patients from
controls. Another microbial marker profile including 37 species was found to be
associated with the response to treatment. An animal experiment showed that
transfer of gut microbiome from VKH patients could significantly exacerbate
disease activity clinically and pathologically in the recipient mice.
CONCLUSION: Our results revealed a distinct gut microbiome signature in VKH
patients and showed an exacerbating effect of this gut microbiome on experimental
autoimmune uveitis (EAU). We also developed two microbial marker profiles in
differentiating VKH patients from healthy controls as well as predicting the
effectiveness of treatment.
