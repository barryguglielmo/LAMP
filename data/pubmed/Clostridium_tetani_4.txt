RATIONALE: Tetanus is usually caused by wound infection with Clostridium tetani
after acute injuries. Skin cancer wound is a rarely reported cause of tetani
infection. It is difficult to be diagnosed and mistaken for other brain lesions.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 49-year-old man presenting with the only symptom of repeated 
convulsions was admitted to our department. He had an ulcerated skin cancer on
the right buttock that had been excised in another hospital 1 month before
admission, leaving the wound unhealed. He was suspected of having a metastatic
brain tumor early, but exhibited a negative cranial CT-scan.
DIAGNOSIS: Tetanus was diagnosed when he was observed to have sudden convulsions 
after sensory stimulation such as noise, light, or touch.
INTERVENTIONS: Despite administration of a high dose of diazepam and
phenobarbitone, continuous generalized rigidity with laryngospasm still occurred.
Instead, when propofol was intravenously infused, the spastic convulsion
completely stopped. Tracheotomy and mechanical ventilation were performed.
OUTCOMES: The patient gradually recovered in 2 weeks.
LESSONS: Tetanus is rarely infected through the wound of an ulcerated skin
cancer. Early diagnosis can only be based on accurate assessment of clinical
manifestations, and propofol infusion appears to be more effective in
anti-convulsion management for patients with tetanus. Routine vaccination to
prevent tetanus in patients with ulcerated skin cancer should be considered in
the future clinical work.
