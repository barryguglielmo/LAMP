Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease in which insulin-producing
pancreatic Î²-cells are destroyed. Intestinal helminths can cause asymptomatic
chronic and immunosuppressive infections and suppress disease in rodent models of
T1D. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms for this protection are
unclear. Here, we report that CD8+ regulatory T (Treg) cells prevent the onset of
streptozotocin -induced diabetes by a rodent intestinal nematode. Trehalose
derived from nematodes affects the intestinal microbiota and increases the
abundance of Ruminococcus spp., resulting in the induction of CD8+ Treg cells.
Furthermore, trehalose has therapeutic effects on both streptozotocin-induced
diabetes and in the NOD mouse model of T1D. In addition, compared with healthy
volunteers, patients with T1D have fewer CD8+ Treg cells, and the abundance of
intestinal Ruminococcus positively correlates with the number of CD8+ Treg cells 
in humans.
