Introduction: The article describes the occurrence and phylogenetic relationship 
of Salmonella isolates found in subcutaneous abscesses of leopard geckos. The aim
of the study was to determine the cause of the abscesses and to characterise
isolated Salmonella strains.
Material and Methods: Samples of abscesses from five animals and internal organs 
(lungs, liver, and gut) of three of them were tested for Salmonella according to 
the PN-EN ISO 6579:2002/A1:2007 standard. The antimicrobial resistance was
evaluated by minimal inhibitory concentrations and the genetic similarity of the 
isolates was assessed with pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).
Results: In total, seventeen Salmonella isolates belonging to five different
serovars were found to be susceptible to all tested antimicrobials except
streptomycin. The serovars were S. Hadar, S. Fluntern, S. Tennessee, S. enterica 
subsp. salamae 55:k:z39, and S. Kentucky. Up to three serovars from different
organs were isolated from the same individual. In two geckos, Salmonella were
detected in the lungs. In three serovars, XbaI-PFGE typing revealed
indistinguishable isolates from organs and abscesses.
Conclusion: Multiple Salmonella serovars might be involved in abscess formation
and infections. The occurrence of the same PFGE profiles of the isolates may
testify to the role of opportunistic organisms in causing infection.
