BACKGROUND: Relapsing peritonitis due to the development of a biofilm in the
catheter's lumen remains an important complication of peritoneal dialysis therapy
that endangers technique continuity. Taurolidine catheter lock has proven
efficient reducing infection rates in permanent hemodialysis catheters based on
its biocidal activity and biofilm detachment effect. Efficacy evidence on its use
in peritoneal dialysis catheters is lacking.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all relapsing peritonitis episodes from June
2018 until October 2019 in our center. Patients were identified and data were
collected from our electronic renal registry and patient's records.
RESULTS: Six patients were identified during the study period. Most patients
(66.6%) were on automated peritoneal dialysis and the median duration of
peritoneal dialysis before the episode of taurolidine was started was
43.66 ± 29.64 months. Mean taurolidine doses were 10 (range: 9-11) and 83.3%
(five patients, with peritonitis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus
aureus, Escherichia coli, and Corynebacterium propinquum) had a favorable
response and microbial eradication without relapses after taurolidine treatment. 
Only one patient relapsed by the same organism (Corynebacterium amycolatum) due
to non-adherence to the antibiotic treatment prescribed. None of the patients
experienced any relevant adverse events, with only two out of six presenting mild
transient abdominal discomfort.
CONCLUSION: We believe that peritoneal catheter taurolidine lock could be
considered in cases of relapsing or refractory peritonitis, as it could prevent
catheter removal and permanent switch to hemodialysis in selected cases, although
literature is scarce and further studies are needed.
