The effects of whole egg on the cecal microbiome of ddY mice has been reported.
To investigate the existence of susceptible indigenous bacteria (SIB) to egg
yolks (EY), mice were fed a diet containing either 20% (w/w) milk casein and 17% 
beef tallow (CT) or 12% milk casein and 27% EY for 14 days, and then, the cecal
microbiome was analyzed by 16S rRNA (V4) amplicon sequencing. To isolate the
typical species in each diet group, culture-dependent viable bacterial counts
were determined on Blood Liver (BL) and Gifu Anaerobic Medium (GAM) agar plates. 
The amplicon sequencing analysis revealed typical CT-SIB, such as
Lachnospiraceae-like bacteria, and EY-SIB, such as Allobaculum-, Lactobacillus
murinus-, and Bacteroides vulgatus-like bacteria. Two of the detected SIB
species, L. murinus- and B. vulgatus-like bacteria, were successfully isolated
from the BL and GAM agar plates and defined using a 16S rDNA BLAST search.
PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The SIB defined in the CT and EY groups might have some
effects on the nutritional and functional chemical compounds in the milk casein, 
beef tallow, and/or EY. Analysis of its functional properties of the isolates
might develop the new and unique probiotic strains.
