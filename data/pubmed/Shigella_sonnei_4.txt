Owing to the scarce evidence about the multidrug-resistant (MDR)
beta-lactamase-producing Shigella isolates in Iran, this study aimed to evaluate 
the occurrence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) and AmpC β-lactamases 
in Shigella species collected in the southwest of Iran. This study was conducted 
on Shigella species isolated from stool samples of pediatric patients aged less
than 15 years suffering from diarrhea. These isolates were identified by
bacteriology tests, serotyping, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The
antibiotic resistance was determined by disc diffusion. The production of ESBLs
and AmpC was investigated by phenotypic confirmatory tests and PCR. In total, 79 
Shigella isolates, including 46.8% (n = 37) of S. flexneri and 53.2% (n = 42) of 
S. sonnei, were isolated, respectively. The most effective antibiotic was
imipenem with 93.7% of susceptibility followed by ampicillin (29.1%), and
cotrimoxazole (30.4%).The resistance rates of ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and
cefotaxime were 41.8%, 34.2%, and 41.8%, respectively. Also, a total of 57
(72.2%) isolates showed MDR profiles. The phenotypic tests showed that 43.0%
(34/79) of isolates can produce ESBLs, and no one was positive for ApmC. The
frequency of blaTEM and blaCTX-M were 30.4% and 32.9%, respectively, while the
blaPER, blaSHV, and AmpC genes were not detected. The ESBL-producing isolates had
a significant (p-value ˂ 0.05) resistance rate against ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, 
cefotaxime, cefepime, erythromycin, and amikacin. The significant prevalence of
MDR Shigella isolates harboring ESBL genes highlights the need for effective
surveillance measures to prevent the more spread of drug resistance among
species.
