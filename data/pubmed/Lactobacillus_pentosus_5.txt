Parametric optimization always plays important roles in bioengineering systems to
obtain a high product yield under the proper conditions. The parametric
conditions of lactic acid production by homologous batch fermentation of
Lactobacillus pentosus cells was optimized by the Box-Behnken design. The highest
l-lactic acid yield was obtained as 0.836 ± 0.003 g/g glucose with the
productivity of 0.906 ± 0.003 g/(L × H) under the optimum conditions of 34.7 °C, 
pH 6.2, 148 rpm agitation speed, and 9.3 g/L nitrogen source concentration
determined by quadratic response surface with high accuracy. The adequate kinetic
models of cell growth rate, lactic production rate, and glucose consumption rate 
were also established to describe the fermentation behavior of L. pentosus cells 
with the correlation coefficients of 09985, 0.9990, and 0.9989, respectively.
