PURPOSE: To determine the genetic characteristics of the Chinese epidemic
ST5-SCCmec II-t311 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clone and
to investigate the transmission characteristics of the cfr-positive plasmid.
METHODS: The complete genome of SR153 was sequenced. Genomic comparison with MRSA
strains of other lineages was performed. The cfr-positive plasmid was
investigated and compared with other cfr-positive plasmids from different origins
and different areas.
RESULTS: The cfr-positive MRSA strain SR153 was a Chinese epidemic ST5-SCCmec
II-t311 strain. It clustered much closer to the Japanese ST5-SCCmec II clone than
to the European and American ST5-SCCmec II clones. The genome of SR153 contains
one circular chromosome and three plasmids. It harbors the genomic islands νSaα, 
νSaβ, νSaγ, ΦSa1 and ΦSa3, the pathogenicity island νSa4, and genes encoding
virulence factors such as tst and many enterotoxins. The SR153 genome also
contains several resistance genes and mutations, such as ermA, aadD, spc,
aacA-aphD, lnuA, tetK, blaZ and mutations in grlA and gyrA. SR153 harbors a
cfr-positive plasmid, pSR01, which is highly similar to pSX01 from a
Staphylococcus xylosus of pig origin from Henan Province. pSR01 was also highly
similar to pXWZ from a Staphylococcus capitis and pLRSA417 from S. aureus. Both
were obtained from geographically separated hospitals in Zhejiang Province.
CONCLUSIONS: SR153, which clustered closely to the Japanese ST5-SCCmec II clone, 
is more resistant than N315. A pSR01-like cfr-positive plasmid was widespread
among different Staphylococcus species of both human and animal origin in
different hospitals and areas.
