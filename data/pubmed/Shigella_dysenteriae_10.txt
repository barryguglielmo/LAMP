The two lectins LecA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the B-subunit of Shiga toxin
from Shigella dysenteriae (StxB) share the glycosphingolipid
globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) as receptor. Counterintuitively, we found that LecA
and StxB segregated into different domains after recognizing Gb3 at the plasma
membrane of cells. We hypothesized that the orientation of the carbohydrate head 
group of Gb3 embedded in the lipid bilayer differentially influences LecA and
StxB binding. To test this hypothesis, we reconstituted lectin-Gb3 interaction
using giant unilamellar vesicles and were indeed able to rebuild LecA and StxB
segregation. Both, the Gb3 fatty acyl chain structure and the local membrane
environment, modulated Gb3 recognition by LecA and StxB. Specifically, StxB
preferred more ordered membranes compared to LecA. Based on our findings, we
propose comparing staining patterns of LecA and StxB as an alternative method to 
assess membrane order in cells. To verify this approach, we re-established that
the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells is more ordered than the
basolateral plasma membrane. Additionally, we found that StxB recognized Gb3 at
the primary cilium and the periciliary membrane, whereas LecA only bound
periciliary Gb3. This suggests that the ciliary membrane is of higher order than 
the surrounding periciliary membrane.
