The use of faecal microbial markers as non-invasive biomarkers for colorectal
cancer (CRC) has been suggested, but not fully elucidated. Here, we have
evaluated the importance of Parvimonas micra as a potential non-invasive faecal
biomarker in CRC and its relation to other microbial biomarkers. The levels of P.
micra, F. nucleatum and clbA + bacteria were quantified using qPCR in faecal
samples from a population-based cohort of patients undergoing colonoscopy due to 
symptoms from the large bowel. The study included 38 CRC patients, 128 patients
with dysplasia and 63 controls. The results were validated in a second
consecutive CRC cohort including faecal samples from 238 CRC patients and 94
controls. We found significantly higher levels of P. micra in faecal samples from
CRC patients compared to controls. A test for P. micra could detect CRC with a
specificity of 87.3% and a sensitivity of 60.5%. In addition, we found that
combining P. micra with other microbial markers, could further enhance test
sensitivity. Our findings support the potential use of P. micra as a non-invasive
biomarker for CRC. Together with other microbial faecal markers, P. micra may
identify patients with "high risk" microbial patterns, indicating increased risk 
and incidence of cancer.
