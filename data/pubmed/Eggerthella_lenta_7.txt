OBJECTIVE: Patients with renal failure suffer from symptoms caused by uraemic
toxins, possibly of gut microbial origin, as deduced from studies in animals. The
aim of the study is to characterise relationships between the intestinal
microbiome composition, uraemic toxins and renal failure symptoms in human
end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
DESIGN: Characterisation of gut microbiome, serum and faecal metabolome and human
phenotypes in a cohort of 223 patients with ESRD and 69 healthy controls.
Multidimensional data integration to reveal links between these datasets and the 
use of chronic kidney disease (CKD) rodent models to test the effects of
intestinal microbiome on toxin accumulation and disease severity.
RESULTS: A group of microbial species enriched in ESRD correlates tightly to
patient clinical variables and encode functions involved in toxin and secondary
bile acids synthesis; the relative abundance of the microbial functions
correlates with the serum or faecal concentrations of these metabolites.
Microbiota from patients transplanted to renal injured germ-free mice or
antibiotic-treated rats induce higher production of serum uraemic toxins and
aggravated renal fibrosis and oxidative stress more than microbiota from
controls. Two of the species, Eggerthella lenta and Fusobacterium nucleatum,
increase uraemic toxins production and promote renal disease development in a CKD
rat model. A probiotic Bifidobacterium animalis decreases abundance of these
species, reduces levels of toxins and the severity of the disease in rats.
CONCLUSION: Aberrant gut microbiota in patients with ESRD sculpts a detrimental
metabolome aggravating clinical outcomes, suggesting that the gut microbiota will
be a promising target for diminishing uraemic toxicity in those patients.
