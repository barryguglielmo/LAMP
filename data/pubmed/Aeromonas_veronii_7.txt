Aim: The present study aimed at highlighting the effects of oyster mushroom
(Pleurotus sajor-caju), as a dietary supplement on growth performance,
differential leukocytes population, and histological changes of melanomacrophage 
centers (MMCs) in spleen and kidney of fancy carp on bacterial infection.
Materials and Methods: A total of 60 fancy carp were allocated into four groups
according to feed formulations including; (1) basal diet with 2% crude extract of
P. sajor-caju, (2) basal diet with 2% b-glucan, whereas Group 3, and Group 4 were
positive and negative control, which were fed only basal diet. Diets were
provided for 30 days, thereafter, fish of Group 1 to Group 3 were
intraperitoneally injected with Aeromonas veronii (1.8×109 CFU), whereas Group 4 
was injected with normal saline. At day 7 post-bacterial inoculation, all fish
were weighed, whole blood was collected for differential white blood cell count, 
and two visceral organs, posterior kidney and spleen, were collected from
euthanized fish to observe histological changes, particularly MMCs.
Results: No significant differences in body weight were found (p>0.05) at 1st
week of the experiment; however, fish body weight was significantly increased
from week 2 to week 4 of the experiment. Increased monocyte number was found in
carp fish fed with the P. sajor-caju or b-glucan supplemented diets compared to
the control groups (p<0.05). The proliferation of monocyte in fish was consistent
with increased number and size of MMCs in hemotopoietic organs, posterior kidney 
and spleen, especially in fancy carp fed with of P. sajor-caju crude extract and 
commercially available b-glucan before bacterial inoculation in fish.
Conclusion: These findings indicate that crude polysaccharide from P. sajor-caju 
can be potentially used as a feed additive that might promote innate immune
function in fish.
