Chitinases possess an extraordinary ability to directly hydrolyze highly
insoluble chitin polymers to low-molecular-weight chito-oligomers, which possess 
particular biological functions, such as elicitor action and antitumor activity. 
A novel strain, Paenibacillus xylanilyticus W4, which was isolated from soil,
showed strong chitin degradation activity. Here, we first reported the complete
genome information of P. xylanilyticus. Paenibacillus xylanilyticus W4 contains a
5,532,141 bp single circular chromosome with 47.33% GC content. The genome
contains 5,996 genes, including 39 rRNA- and 109 tRNA-coding genes. Phylogenetic 
analysis and Genome-to-Genome Distance revealed its taxonomic characterization
into a separate family. Six glycoside hydrolase 18 (GH18) and 2 GH23 enzymes
involved in chitin degradation. Although many of the chitinases were conserved in
Paenibacillus, several GH18 chitinases share high similarity with Bacillus
circulans. The genome information provided here could benefit for understanding
the chitin-degrading properties of P. xylanilyticus as well as its potential
application in biotechnological and pharmaceutical fields.
