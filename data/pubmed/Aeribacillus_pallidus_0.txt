This work aimed to evaluate the applicability of Aeribacillus pallidus for the
aerobic treatment of the concentrated beet vinasse with high chemical oxygen
demand (COD 685 g.L-1) that is defined as an environmental pollutant. This
bacterium is a polyextremophilic strain and grow aerobically up to 7.5% vinasse
at high temperature (50 °C). In the bioreactor and under controlled conditions,
A. pallidus reduced the soluble COD content of 5% vinasse up to 27% during 48 h
and utilized glucose and glycerol, completely. Furthermore, a reduction of
manganese, copper, aluminum, and nickel concentrations was observed in the
treated vinasse with A. pallidus. The obtained results make this strain as an
appropriate alternative to be used for the aerobic bioprocessing of the vinasse.
