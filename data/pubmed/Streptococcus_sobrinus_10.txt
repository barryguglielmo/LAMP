OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the antibiofilm and anti-caries effects of an
experimental mouth rinse containing aqueous extract of Matricaria chamomilla L.
METHODS: Microcosm biofilm was produced on bovine enamel, from pooled human
saliva mixed with McBain saliva, under 0.2 % sucrose exposure, for 5 days. The
biofilm was daily treated using (1 mL/1 min): Vochysia tucanorum Mart.
(2.5 mg/mL); Myrcia bella Cambess. (1.25 mg/mL); Matricaria chamomilla L.
(20 mg/mL); Malva sylvestris (Malvatricin® Plus-Daudt); 0.12 % Chlorhexidine
(PerioGard®-Palmolive, Positive control) and PBS (Negative control). The % dead
bacteria, biofilm thickness, EPS biovolume, lactic acid concentration, the CFU
counting (total microorganisms, Lactobacillus sp., total streptococci and
Streptococcus mutans/S. sobrinus) were determined. Enamel demineralization was
measured by TMR.
RESULTS: All mouth rinses induced bacterial death compared to PBS (p < 0.0001).
The biofilm thickness varied from 12 ± 2 μm (chlorhexidine) to 18 ± 2 μm (V.
tucanorum) (ANOVA/Tukey, p < 0.0001). The EPS biovolume varied from 7(4)%
(chlorhexidine) to 30(20)% (PBS) (Kruskal-Wallis/Dunn, p < 0.0001). The lactic
acid production was reduced by M. sylvestris (1.1 ± 0.2 g/L) and chlorhexidine
(0.6 ± 0.2 g/L) compared to PBS (2.6 ± 1.3 g/L) (ANOVA, p < 0.0001). Malva
sylvestris and chlorhexidine showed significant low CFU for total microorganisms,
Lactobacillus sp. and total streptococci. Only chlorhexidine significantly
reduced S. mutans/S. sobrinus. CFUs for total streptococci and Lactobacillus sp, 
were also significantly reduced by M. chamomilla L. Malva sylvestris (63.4 % of
mineral loss reduction), chlorhexidine (47.4 %) and M. chamomilla L. (39.4 %)
significantly reduced enamel demineralization compared to PBS (ANOVA/Tukey,
p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: M. chamomilla L. has lower antibiofilm action, but comparable
anti-caries effect to those found for chlorhexidine, under this model.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study shows that the antibiofilm and anti-caries
potential may vary between the commercial and experimental mouth rinses
containing natural agents, with promising results for those containing Matricaria
chamomilla L. and Malva Sylvestris.
