The relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors to variation in
immune responses are poorly understood. Here, we performed a phenotypic analysis 
of immunological parameters in laboratory mice carrying susceptibility genes
implicated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (Nod2 and Atg16l1) upon exposure
to environmental microbes. Mice were released into an outdoor enclosure
(rewilded) and then profiled for immune responses in the blood and lymph nodes.
Variations of immune cell populations were largely driven by the environment,
whereas cytokine production elicited by microbial antigens was more affected by
the genetic mutations. We identified transcriptional signatures in the lymph
nodes associated with differences in T cell populations. Subnetworks associated
with responses against Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, and Bacteroides
vulgatus were also coupled with rewilding. Therefore, exposing laboratory mice
with genetic mutations to a natural environment uncovers different contributions 
to variations in microbial responses and immune cell composition.
