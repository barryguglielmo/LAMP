Plant-derived lignans, consumed daily by most individuals, are thought to protect
against cancer and other diseases1; however, their bioactivity requires gut
bacterial conversion to enterolignans2. Here, we dissect a four-species bacterial
consortium sufficient for all five reactions in this pathway. A single enzyme
(benzyl ether reductase, encoded by the gene ber) was sufficient for the first
two biotransformations, variable between strains of Eggerthella lenta, critical
for enterolignan production in gnotobiotic mice and unique to Coriobacteriia.
Transcriptional profiling (RNA sequencing) independently identified ber and
genomic loci upregulated by each of the remaining substrates. Despite their low
abundance in gut microbiomes and restricted phylogenetic range, all of the
identified genes were detectable in the distal gut microbiomes of most
individuals living in northern California. Together, these results emphasize the 
importance of considering strain-level variations and bacterial co-occurrence to 
gain a mechanistic understanding of the bioactivation of plant secondary
metabolites by the human gut microbiome.
