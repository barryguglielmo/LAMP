BACKGROUND: For screening probiotic strains with viability and stability in
non-dairy foods for health benefits, we revised all patents relating to
probiotics in food.
OBJECTIVE: Screening of potential probiotics from Brazilian Minas artisanal
cheese and verify their survival in frozen Brazilian cocoa pulp.
METHODS: Isolation and identification of the strains. The potential probiotic
characterization involved gastric juice and bile resistance, antibiotic and
antimicrobial activity, hydrophobicity, autoaggregation, coaggregation and
adhesion assay in HT-29 cells. Organoleptic, viability and stability of probiotic
strain in frozen cocoa pulp were evaluated.
RESULTS: Fourteen strains of Lactobacillus plantarum (9), Weissella
paramesenteroides (3), Lactobacillus fermentum (1), and Leuconostoc mesenteroides
(1) were obtained. Most of the strains were resistant to simulated gastric
acidity and bile salts. Almost all strains were sensitive to the antibiotics
tested, except to ciprofloxacin and vancomycin. About 47% of the strains are
potential producers of bacteriocins. High hydrophobicity was observed for four
strains. Autoaggregation ranged from 8.3-72.6% and the coaggregation capacity
from 5.2-60.2%. All of the assessed strains presented more than 90% of adhesion
to HT-29 intestinal cells. The percentage of Salmonella inhibition in HT-29 cells
ranged from 4.7-31.1%. No changes in color, aroma, and pH were observed in cocoa 
pulps after storage at -20 °C for 90 days.
CONCLUSION: Wild strains of acid lactic bacteria from cheese proved to be viable 
and stable in frozen Brazilian cocoa pulp. This work showed a promising
application of L. plantarum isolated strains to be used with frozen cocoa pulp
matrix in probiotics food industry.
