Organic acid contents of acidified and fermented fish silages made from gibel
carp (Caracius gibelio) and klunzinger's ponyfish (Equulites klunzingeri) fishes,
and from fish processing residues or by-products, were determined and studied.
The silages were undertaken in wet and spray-dried fish-based raw-materials for 3
weeks at room temperature (ca. 25 °C). Selected lactic acid bacteria (LAB) of
Enterococcus gallinarum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus plantarum,
Pediococcus acidilactici, and Streptococcus spp. were employed to produce
fermented fish-based silages, while acidified silage was prepared resorting to
the addition of formic acid (3%, v/v). Lactic and propionic acids were the
dominant produced organic acids, while succinic acid was formed at the smallest
amounts in fermented silages. In the acidified silage, lactic and formic acids
were produced in amounts higher than 800 and 1000 mg organic acid/100g sample,
respectively. Among the fermented fish-based silages, LAB strains unfolded
considerable ability to presumptively produce propionic acid in gibel carp silage
(>2370 mg organic acid/100g sample). Spray-dried fermented silages displayed
significantly higher organic acid content than wet silages. Propionic acid
accumulation was found at the highest levels in gibel carp silage fermented with 
L. plantarum (6335.40 mg propionic acid/100g sample). This research effort
pointed out the good capability of various selected lactic acid bacteria strains 
to produce significant amounts of organic acids-especially lactic, acetic, and
propionic acids-during the fermentation of fish-based silages. In terms of food
safety and quality, such a production of relatively high amounts of organic acids
in wet and spray-dried fish-based silages clearly indicated their suitableness to
be used for animal feed.
