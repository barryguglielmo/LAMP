International reports indicate a rising incidence of nontuberculous mycobacterial
(NTM) disease. Many infectious diseases have seasonal variation in incidence, and
major weather events and climate change have been implicated. The aim of this
study was to explore the relationship between climate variables and NTM incident 
cases in Queensland, Australia.METHODS: NTM data were obtained from the
Queensland notifiable conditions database for the period 2001-2016. Rainfall and 
temperature data were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Poisson
regression models were used to assess notification rates (incidence cases per
100,000 population) over time and to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR). Cross 
correlation coefficients were used to examine the relationship between rainfall
and temperature data and NTM incidence over time in each Hospital and Health
Service (HHS).
RESULTS: 12,219 NTM cases were reported. The most common species was M.
intracellulare (39.1%), followed by M. avium (9.8%), M abscessus (8.5%), M.
fortuitum (8.3%), M. chelonae (3.3%), and M. kansasii (2.4%). The estimated
incidence rate increased from 11.10 (95% CI 8.10-15.22) in 2001 to 25.88 (95%CI
21.78-30.73) per 100,000 in 2016. The estimated IRR increased for all common
species, except M. kansasii. Although increased IRRs were observed for most NTM
species, geospatial heterogeneity was observed. The effect of rainfall and
temperature on NTM incidence differed between species and geographic regions.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of NTM infections increased between 2001 and 2016.
Variations in temperature and rainfall may play a role in environmental exposure 
to some species of NTM. Spatial variation in IRR suggests that there may also be 
other environmental factors that influence transmission.
