Inspired by the interesting natural antimicrobial properties of honey, biohybrid 
composite materials containing a low-fouling polymer hydrogel network and an
encapsulated antimicrobial peroxide-producing enzyme have been developed. These
synergistically combine both passive and active mechanisms for reducing microbial
bacterial colonization. The mechanical properties of these materials were
assessed using compressive mechanical analysis, which revealed these hydrogels
possessed tunable mechanical properties with Young's moduli ranging from 5 to
500Â kPa. The long-term enzymatic activities of these materials were also assessed
over a 1-month period using colorimetric assays. Finally, the passive low-fouling
properties and active antimicrobial activity against a leading opportunistic
pathogen, Staphylococcus epidermidis, were confirmed using bacterial cell
counting and bacterial adhesion assays. This study resulted in non-adhesive
substrate-permeable antimicrobial materials, which could reduce the viability of 
planktonic bacteria by greater than 7 logs. It is envisaged these new biohybrid
materials will be important for reducing bacterial adherence in a range of
industrial applications.
