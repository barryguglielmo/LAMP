This is the first reported case, to our knowledge, of co-infection of Bordetella 
bronchiseptica and SARS-CoV-2 in a young patient with underlying idiopathic
bronchiectasis and vitamin D3 deficiency that was treated successfully with a
combination therapeutic regime integrating doxycycline, empiric therapies for
COVID-19, vitamin D supplementation, and supportive ICU care. Large prospective
studies are required to investigate further the role of co-infections in COVID-19
patients with bronchiectasis. Randomized control trials should examine the
putative beneficial role of vitamin D supplementation in patients with COVID-19.
