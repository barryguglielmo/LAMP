AIM: To explore the application of the combined use of baseline salivary
biomarkers and clinical parameters in predicting the outcome of scaling and root 
planing (SRP).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty patients with advanced periodontitis were included. 
Baseline saliva samples were analyzed for interleukin-1β, matrix
metalloproteinase-8, and the loads of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella
intermedia, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Tannerella forsythia.
After SRP, pocket closure and further attachment loss at 6 months post-treatment 
were chosen as outcome variables. Models to predict the outcomes were established
by generalized estimating equations.
RESULTS: The combined use of baseline clinical attachment level, site location
and interleukin-1β (AUC=0.764) better predicted pocket closure than probing depth
(AUC=0.672), clinical attachment level (AUC=0.679), site location (AUC=0.654), or
interleukin-1β (AUC=0.579) alone. The combination of site location, tooth loss,
percentage of deep pockets, detection of A. actinomycetemcomitans, and T.
forsythia load (AUC=0.842) better predicted further clinical attachment loss than
site location (AUC=0.715), tooth loss (AUC=0.530), percentage of deep pockets
(AUC=0.659), or T. forsythia load (AUC=0.647) alone.
CONCLUSION: The combination of baseline salivary biomarkers and clinical
parameters better predicted SRP outcomes than each alone. The current study
indicates the possible usefulness of salivary biomarkers in addition to tooth
related parameters in predicting SRP outcomes.
