The inhibitory properties of novel antimicrobial proteins against food-borne
pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes offer extensive benefits to the food and
medical industries. In this study, we have identified antimicrobial proteins from
a milk curd-derived bacterial isolate that exhibits antilisterial activity using 
genome mining and mass spectrometry analysis. The analysis of the draft genome
sequence identified the isolate as Paenibacillus polymyxa Kp10, and predicted the
presence of antimicrobial paenibacillin, paenilan, paeninodin, sactipeptides,
thiazole-oxazole modified microcin, and histone-like DNA binding protein HU
encoded in its genome. Interestingly, nanoLC-MS/MS analysis identified two
histone-like DNA binding proteins HU as predicted in silico earlier, exhibiting
antilisterial activity. Additionally, translation initiation factor IF-1 and 50S 
ribosomal protein L29 were also discovered by the mass spectrometry in the active
fractions. The antilisterial activity of the four proteins was verified through
heterologous protein expression and antimicrobial activity assay in vitro. This
study has identified structural regulatory proteins from Paenibacillus possessing
antilisterial activity with potential future application in the food and medical 
industries.
