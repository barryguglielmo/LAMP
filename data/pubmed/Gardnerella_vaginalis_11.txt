BACKGROUND: We determined how the vaginal and penile microbiomes contribute to
HSV-2 serostatus within sexual partnerships.
METHODS: Microbiomes were characterized in cervicovaginal lavage and penile
meatal swab through high-throughput 16s ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing.
HSV-2 antibody was detected in serum. We modeled vaginal and penile taxa and
covariates contributing to HSV-2 status in women and men using bivariate probit.
RESULTS: Among 231 couples, HSV-2 was detected in: 78 (33.8%) both the man and
woman, 52 (22.5%) woman only, 27 (11.7%) man only, 74 (32.0%) neither. Women were
median age 22 years, 10.9% with HIV, 21.4% with Bacterial vaginosis (BV). Men
were median age 26 years, 11.8% with HIV, 55.0% circumcised. In analysis adjusted
for sociodemographics and BV, enrichment of vaginal Gardnerella vaginalis and
Lactobacillus iners was associated with increased likelihood of HSV-2 in women
and HSV-2 in male partners. Penile taxa (including Ureaplasma and Aerococcus)
were associated with HSV-2 in women.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that penile taxa are associated with HSV-2 in female 
partners, and vaginal taxa are associated with HSV-2 in male partners. Our
findings suggest that couples-level joint consideration of genital microbiome and
STI or related outcomes could lead to new avenues for prevention.
