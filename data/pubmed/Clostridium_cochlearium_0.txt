We report the draft genome sequence of a new Clostridium cochlearium strain,
AGROS13, which was isolated from a sheep dairy farm environment in New Zealand.
The genome is 2.7 Mbp, with a GC content of 28.2%. The genome sequence was found 
to be closely related to that of Clostridium cochlearium ATCC 17787. The new
strain harbors a biosynthetic gene cluster coding for an unknown sactipeptide.
