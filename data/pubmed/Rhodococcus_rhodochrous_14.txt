Human infection due to Rhodococcus equi was first reported in 1967 by a young man
on immunosuppressant agents who was working in a stockyard. As the name implies, 
the infection is closely linked to animals, horses and foal are considered as the
natural host. Other species of Rhodococcus similarly described as human pathogens
include Rhodococcus fascians, Rhodococcus rhodochrous,
and Rhodococcus erythropolis. Rhodococcus belongs to the Nocardiaceae family
which also comprises Nocardia, Mycobacterium, Corynebacterium, and Gordonia with 
some similarities among the group.[1][2] Immunosuppression, especially defects in
cell-mediated immunity, plays a major role in disease and is present in most
reported cases even though infection has also been described less commonly in
immunocompetent hosts. Common immunocompromised conditions where infection had
been described include HIV, solid organ and stem cell transplant recipients,
leukemia, lymphoma, lung cancer, and following chemotherapy, monoclonal
antibodies, or prolonged steroid use.[3]
