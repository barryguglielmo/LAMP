In this study, a cadmium-tolerant bacterium, Enterobacter ludwigii LY6, was
isolated from cadmium-contaminated soil in Shifang, Sichuan province, China. The 
cadmium chloride removal rate of the strain LY6 with a treatment of 100 mg/L
cadmium chloride reached 56.0%. Scanning electron microscopy showed that
exopolysaccharides (EPS) might be the main means of cadmium adsorption by the
strain. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS) analyses indicated that cadmium sulfide nanoparticles formed on the surface
of bacteria cultured in a medium containing 100 mg/L cadmium chloride. In
addition, the expression of several genes increased with the increase of the
cadmium concentration in the medium, including the multiple antibiotic resistance
proteins marA and marR, and the cold shock protein CspA. GO functions, such as
the redox activity, respiratory chain and transport functions, and KEGG pathways 
involved in "bacterial chemotaxis" and "terpenoid backbone biosynthesis" were
found to be closely related to bacterial cadmium tolerance and biosorption. This 
is the first report that E. ludwigii can reduce sulfate to form cadmium sulfide
nanoparticles under high concentration cadmium exposure. The genes related to
cadmium tolerance identified in this study lay a foundation for the genetic
breeding of cadmium-tolerant strains.
