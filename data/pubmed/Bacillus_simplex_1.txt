We aimed to profile the metabolism of soybean roots that were infected with
soybean cyst nematodes and treated with Bacillus simplex to identify metabolic
differences that may explain nematode resistance. Compared with control soybean
roots, B. simplex-treated soybean roots contained lower levels of glucose,
fructose, sucrose, and trehalose, which reduced the nematodes' food source.
Furthermore, treatment with B. simplex led to higher levels of melibiose,
gluconic acid, lactic acid, phytosphingosine, and noradrenaline in soybean roots,
which promoted nematocidal activity. The levels of oxoproline, maltose, and
galactose were lowered after B. simplex treatment, which improved disease
resistance. Collectively, this study provides insight into the metabolic
alterations induced by B. simplex treatment, which affects the interactions with 
soybean cyst nematodes.
