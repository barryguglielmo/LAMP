In this study, a microbiological inhibition method for rapidly screening
antibiotics in swine urine was established with an easy sample pre-treatment. The
microbiological system consisted of an agar medium mixed with nutrients,
sensitizers, a test bacterium (Geobacillus stearothermophilus ATCC12980) and pH
indicator (bromocresol purple). It was observed that the detection limits of the 
test kit for twenty-eight common antimicrobial residues in urine, including
β-lactams, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, macrolides, and
lincosamides, were less than or equal to the maximum residue limits of the
kidney, as determined by the EU and China. Moreover, the false negative rate and 
the false positive rate, along with other performance indexes such as interassay 
coefficients of variation and shelf life of the kit, all met the standard
requirements of the ISO13969:2003 guidelines. Additionally, our results were
consistent with those using the gold-standard physical chemistry method, which
suggest the proposed method is suitable for screening antibiotic residues.
