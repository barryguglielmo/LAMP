BACKGROUND: In humans, Enterococcus spp. urinary tract infections (UTI) are
commonly associated with urinary catheter-induced urothelial inflammation but
this is not the case in dogs.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To identify risk factors predisposing dogs to enterococcal
bacteriuria.
ANIMALS: Seventy dogs with Enterococcus spp. bacteriuria (case) and 70 dogs with 
Enterococcus coli bacteriuria (control).
METHODS: A single center retrospective case-control study with subjects and
controls identified by a medical records search for Enterococcus spp. (subject)
or E coli (control) bacteriuria from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2017. Cases 
and controls were balanced with respect to average age and weight. Binary
logistic regression was used to estimate and test whether the odds of having
Enterococcus spp. bacteriuria (instead of E coli) were associated with the
presence of any given characteristic.
RESULTS: A history of recurrent bacteriuria was significantly more common in
Enterococcus spp. cases than in E coli controls (odds ratio [OR]: 2.07; 95%
confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-4.16, P = .04). Comorbidities associated with the 
presence of Enterococcus spp. bacteriuria included lower urinary tract (LUT)
anatomic abnormalities (OR: 2.94; 95% CI: 1.17-8.10, P = .02), urolithiasis (P = 
.01), and the presence of LUT neoplasia (P = .04). Small frequencies (n = 12 and 
n = 6, respectively) compromise our ability to precisely estimate the genuine OR 
for the latter 2 characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: If the identified risk factors promote
Enterococcus spp. colonization in dogs via induced LUT inflammation similar to
people then Enterococcus spp. bacteriuria could be a sentinel for underlying LUT 
inflammation.
