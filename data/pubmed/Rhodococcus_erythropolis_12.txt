Nanofiber scaffolds provide numerous advantages over common carriers engineered
for microorganisms. The most important advantage is an increased speed of primary
surface colonization (up to four times faster), which shortens the time required 
for the areal biofilm formation and optimum performance of attached
microorganisms (higher efficiency of biological activity of up to twice as fast).
Image analysis predicts early formation of biofilm even in beginning stages;
analysis of biofilm reveals the different structures of bacterial colonies on
both scaffolds (higher porosity, size, and number of bacterial colonies on
nanofiber's surface). The image analysis correlates well with determinations of
dry matter (linear correlation of 0.96) and proteins (linear correlation of
0.89).
