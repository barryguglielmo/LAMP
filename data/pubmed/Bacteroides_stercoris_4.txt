Retinal artery occlusion (RAO) is a sight threatening complication of
cardiovascular disease and commonly occurs due to underlying atherosclerosis. As 
cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis in particular has been associated with
compositional alterations in the gut microbiome, we investigated this association
in patients with clinically confirmed non-arteritic RAO compared to age- and
sex-matched controls. On the phylum level, the relative abundance of
Bacteroidetes was decreased in patients with RAO compared to controls, whereas
the opposite applied for the phylum of Proteobacteria. Several genera and species
such as Actinobacter, Bifidobacterium spp., Bacteroides stercoris,
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were relatively enriched in patients with RAO,
whereas others such as Odoribacter, Parasutterella or Lachnospiraceae were
significantly lower. Patient's gut microbiomes were enriched in genes of the
cholesterol metabolism pathway. The gut derived, pro-atherogenic metabolite
trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) was significantly higher in patients with RAO
compared to controls (p = 0.023) and a negative correlation between relative
abundances of genera Parasutterella and Lachnospiraceae and TMAO levels and a
positive correlation between relative abundance of genus Akkermansia and TMAO
levels was found in study subjects. Our findings proposes that RAO is associated 
with alterations in the gut microbiome and with elevated TMAO levels, suggesting 
that RAO could be targeted by microbiome-altering interventions.
