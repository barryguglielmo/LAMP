Oral diseases are biofilm-mediated diseases caused by imbalances in the ecology
of resident microflora. Among them, dental caries (tooth decay) is considered the
most common disease worldwide, and toothbrushing, which physically eliminates the
oral biofilm, is the most widespread prevention strategy. Although it is well
established that fluoride increases enamel resistance to acidic pH and promotes
tooth remineralization, its effect on the biofilm bacterial communities'
composition and metabolism is not fully understood. We have grown in vitro oral
biofilms and used 16S rRNA Illumina sequencing to study the effect of fluoride on
DNA- and RNA-based bacterial populations. In addition, a metatranscriptomic
approach has also been performed, in which total RNA has been sequenced to study 
gene expression profiles in the presence/absence of 500 ppm sodium fluoride. Our 
data show a lower pH drop and a clear shift in total and metabolically active
bacterial composition after fluoride exposure. Streptococcus oralis was the
species most affected, with a 10-fold reduction in both DNA and RNA samples,
whereas Rothia mucilaginosa underwent an 8-fold increase in the DNA and S.
salivarius a 4- and 5-fold increase in the RNA and DNA samples, respectively. The
metatranscriptomes indicated that fluoride exposure induced a dramatic shutdown
of sugar metabolism, including significant under-expression of different sugar
transporters, fucosidases, and a pyruvate oxidase, among others. The reduction in
saccharolytic organisms and the inhibition of sugar fermentation pathways by
fluoride may therefore be considered instrumental for the beneficial effect of
fluoride-containing oral hygiene products.
