Bartonella sp. infection is quite common in free-roaming dogs in many tropical
countries. However, limited information is available of the presence of these
pathogens in Mexico. The present study looked at prevalence of Bartonella
exposure and/or infection in dogs and their fleas in Central Mexico. Blood
samples were collected from 31 stray dogs in August 2014 at the municipal pound, 
Tulancingo, Mexico, as well as fleas on 26 of them. Bartonella seropositivity was
46.9%, including 35.5% for Bartonella henselae, 45% for Bartonella clarridgeiae
and 32.2% for Bartonella vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii. Three (9.7%) dogs were
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive for the Bartonella gltA gene. Partial
sequencing of that gene revealed that these three dogs were infected with B.
henselae. In total, 86 fleas were collected from 26 dogs (range 1-9 fleas per
dog), including 52 Ctenocephalides felis and 34 Ctenocephalides canis. Of 40
pools of fleas (20 pools of C. canis and 20 pools of C. felis), five (12.5%) were
PCR positive for the Bartonella sp. gltA gene, including three C. canis pools
(five fleas) and two C. felis pools (three fleas). All sequences showed 99.25% to
100% homology with B. henselae Houston I.
