Piglet diarrhea and even death due to Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens)
type C infection have led to huge economic losses in the pig industry worldwide. 
C. perfringens beta2 (CPB2) toxin is the main virulence factor for this pathogen.
MiR-140-5p can exacerbate toxin-induced toxicity of toxin to cells by promoting
oxidative stress. However, the role of pig miR-140-5p (ssc-miR-140-5p) in piglet 
diarrhea caused by C. perfringens type C has not been studied. Here, we study
investigated the function of ssc-miR-140-5p by generating an in vitro
CPB2-induced injury model in intestinal porcine epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells. Our
results revealed that transfection with an ssc-miR-140-5p inhibitor significantly
increased the viability of CPB2-induced IPEC-J2 cells, decrease the release of
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and inhibit
inflammatory responses and apoptosis. In addition, vascular endothelial growth
factor A (VEGFA) was identified as a direct target of ssc-miR-140-5p by
luciferase reporter assay. Western blot analysis showed that inhibition of
ssc-miR-140-5p could activate the ERK1/2 signaling pathway and inhibit the JNK
signaling pathway. In summary, we showed that down-regulation of ssc-miR-140-5p
ameliorated CPB2-induced inflammatory responses in IPEC-J2 cells via the ERK1/2
and JNK signaling pathways by targeting VEGFA.
