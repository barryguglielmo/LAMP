The reassessment of known but neglected natural compounds is a vital strategy for
providing novel lead structures urgently needed to overcome antimicrobial
resistance. Scaffolds with resistance-breaking properties represent the most
promising candidates for a successful translation into future therapeutics. Our
study focuses on chelocardin, a member of the atypical tetracyclines, and its
bioengineered derivative amidochelocardin, both showing broad-spectrum
antibacterial activity within the ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus
aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
and Enterobacter species) panel. Further lead development of chelocardins
requires extensive biological and chemical profiling to achieve favorable
pharmaceutical properties and efficacy. This study shows that both molecules
possess resistance-breaking properties enabling the escape from most common
tetracycline resistance mechanisms. Further, we show that these compounds are
potent candidates for treatment of urinary tract infections due to their in vitro
activity against a large panel of multidrug-resistant uropathogenic clinical
isolates. In addition, the mechanism of resistance to natural chelocardin was
identified as relying on efflux processes, both in the chelocardin producer
Amycolatopsis sulphurea and in the pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae. Resistance
development in Klebsiella led primarily to mutations in ramR, causing increased
expression of the acrAB-tolC efflux pump. Most importantly, amidochelocardin
overcomes this resistance mechanism, revealing not only the improved activity
profile but also superior resistance-breaking properties of this novel
antibacterial compound.
