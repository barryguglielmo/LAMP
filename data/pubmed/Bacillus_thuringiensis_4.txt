The morphological and physiological characteristics of Bacillus thuringiensis
strains were analyzed and conditions for obtaining culture fluid with maximum
yield of secreted RNases were determined. Zymographic analysis showed that
culture fluid of B. thuringiensis strains along with low-molecular-weight (15-20 
kDa) RNases contained enzymes with a molecular weight ~55 kDa and their content
depended on the duration and conditions of culturing. Preparations based on B.
thuringiensis culture fluid were effective against human influenza virus
A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2). In experiments on mice infected with 10 LD50 influenza virus
strain A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2), we selected effective variants of preparations based 
on culture fluid of B. thuringiensi strains for preventive administration that
provided reliable protection of infected animals (protection coefficient 50%),
close to that of the reference drug Tamiflu.
