OBJECTIVE: To compare the oral microbiota of Sjögren's syndrome (SS) with that of
healthy subjects (HS).
METHODS: Supragingival and subgingival biofilm samples were collected from the
mesial-buccal tooth surfaces of SS patients (n = 57) and age- and sex-matched HS 
(n = 53). Unstimulated saliva and 8 oral tissue samples were taken using a buccal
brush. Caries and periodontal measures were recorded. All supragingival samples
and a subgroup of 24 SS and 28 HS subgingival samples, as well as 32 SS and 11 HS
saliva and oral tissue samples, were analyzed for their content of 41 bacterial
species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Mean levels (×105 ± SEM) and
percentage of DNA probe counts of each species were determined for each sample
site and averaged within subjects in the 2 clinical groups. Kruskal-Wallis tests,
adjusting for multiple comparisons and cluster analysis, were used for soft
tissue and microbial analysis, and the Mann-Whitney test was used to compare
caries and periodontal measures.
RESULTS: Mean (×105 ± SEM) total DNA probe counts in supragingival samples were
significantly lower (P < 0.001) in the SS (13.3 ± .7) compared to the HS (44.1 ± 
6.8) group. In supragingival samples, Veillonella parvula, Fusobacterium
nucleatum ss vincenti, and Propionibacterium acnes were markedly elevated in the 
SS compared to the HS group in both mean (×105 ± SEM) and mean (± SEM) percentage
DNA probe counts (P < 0.001). In subgingival samples of SS, V. parvula was
significantly different compared to HS (P < 0.05). SS was characterized by high
levels of purple and low levels of orange and red complexes. Cluster analysis of 
oral tissues and saliva demonstrated that the mean microbial profiles for SS
patients and the HS group clustered separately. Active root caries (P < 0.003)
and attachment loss were significantly higher (P < 0.029) in the SS group
compared to the HS group.
CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that saliva is a major controlling factor of 
intraoral biofilm. V. parvula may be a unique microbial biomarker for Sjögren's
syndrome.
KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: The microbiome characterized for Sjögren's syndrome
in salivary hypofunction is shown to be under stress and reduced. Veillonella
parvula can be a possible identification of a biomarker for Sjögren's syndrome.
