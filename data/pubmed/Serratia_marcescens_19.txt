How microbe-microbe interactions dictate microbial complexity in the mosquito gut
is unclear. Previously we found that, Serratia, a gut symbiont that alters vector
competence and is being considered for vector control, poorly colonized Aedes
aegypti yet was abundant in Culex quinquefasciatus reared under identical
conditions. To investigate the incompatibility between Serratia and Ae. aegypti, 
we characterized two distinct strains of Serratia marcescens from Cx.
quinquefasciatus and examined their ability to infect Ae. aegypti. Both Serratia 
strains poorly infected Ae. aegypti, but when microbiome homeostasis was
disrupted, the prevalence and titers of Serratia were similar to the infection in
its native host. Examination of multiple genetically diverse Ae. aegypti lines
found microbial interference to S. marcescens was commonplace, however, one line 
of Ae. aegypti was susceptible to infection. Microbiome analysis of resistant and
susceptible lines indicated an inverse correlation between Enterobacteriaceae
bacteria and Serratia, and experimental co-infections in a gnotobiotic system
recapitulated the interference phenotype. Furthermore, we observed an effect on
host behavior; Serratia exposure to Ae. aegypti disrupted their feeding behavior,
and this phenotype was also reliant on interactions with their native microbiota.
Our work highlights the complexity of host-microbe interactions and provides
evidence that microbial interactions influence mosquito behavior.
