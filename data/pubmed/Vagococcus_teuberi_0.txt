A Gram-stain-positive, coccus- or oval-shaped, non-motile, haemolytic,
asporogenous, catalase- and oxidase-negative, and facultatively anaerobic strain,
2B-2T, was isolated from a brewer's grain used to make silage in Taiwan.
Comparative analyses of 16S rRNA, hsp60 and pheS gene sequences demonstrated that
strain 2B-2T was a member of the genus Vagococcus. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene 
sequence similarity, the type strains of Vagococcus teuberi (98.4 % similarity), 
Vagococcus carniphilus (98.4 %), Vagococcus martis (98.2 %), Vagococcus penaei
(98.2 %) and Vagococcus fluvialis (98.0 %) were the closest neighbours to this
novel strain. The similarity levels of concatenated housekeeping gene sequences
(hsp60 and pheS) between strain 2B-2T and these closely related species ranged
from 84.5 to 88.0 %. The average nucleotide identity and in silico DNA-DNA
hybridization values between strain 2B-2T and its closest relatives were lower
than 72.9 and 21.6 %, respectively. The DNA G+C content was 34.7 mol%. Phenotypic
and genotypic features demonstrated that strain 2B-2T represents a novel species 
of the genus Vagococcus, for which the name Vagococcus silagei sp. nov. is
proposed. The type strain is 2B-2T (=BCRC 81132T=NBRC 113536T).
