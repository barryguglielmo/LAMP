Microbial agents including periodontal pathogens have recently appeared as
important actors in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. We examined associations 
of clinical periodontal and bacterial parameters with incident all-cause and AD
dementia as well as AD mortality among US middle-aged and older adults. Clinical 
[Attachment Loss (AL); probing pocket depth (PPD)] and bacterial [pathogen
immunoglobulin G (IgG)] periodontal markers were investigated in relation to AD
and all-cause dementia incidence and to AD mortality, using data from the third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES III, 1988-1994) linked 
longitudinally with National Death Index and Medicare data through January 1,
2014, with up to 26 years of follow-up. Sex- and age-specific
multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were conducted. Among
those ≥65 years, AD incidence and mortality were consistently associated with
PPD, two factors and one cluster comprised of IgG titers against Porphyromonas
gingivalis (P. gingivalis), Prevotella melaninogenica (P. melaninogenica) and
Campylobacter rectus (C. rectus) among others. Specifically, AD incidence was
linked to a composite of C. rectus and P. gingivalis titers (per SD, aHR = 1.22; 
95% CI, 1.04-1.43, p = 0.012), while AD mortality risk was increased with another
composite (per SD, aHR = 1.46; 95% CI, 1.09-1.96, p = 0.017) loading highly on
IgG for P. gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens,
Fusobacterium nucleatum, C. rectus, Streptococcus intermedius, Capnocylophaga
Ochracea, and P. melaninogenica. This study provides evidence for an association 
between periodontal pathogens and AD, which was stronger for older adults.
Effectiveness of periodontal pathogen treatment on reducing sequelae of
neurodegeneration should be tested in randomized controlled trials.
