Staphylococcus saprophyticus is a significant cause of urinary tract infections
in younger women, but it has been understudied at the genomic level. We report
genome sequences of six S. saprophyticus isolates obtained from female patients
who presented with urinary tract infection symptoms at a college health center in
2019.
