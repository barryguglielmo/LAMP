Aim: This research aimed to identify Staphylococcus species isolated from
preputial swabs of healthy Aceh cattle, based on 16S ribosomal RNA gene analysis.
Materials and Methods: The bacterium was isolated from preputial swabs of healthy
Aceh cattle. The total DNA from the isolated bacteria was extracted using the
Genomic DNA Mini Kit followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of
the 16S rRNA gene. The product of PCR amplification was then sequenced and
aligned to the known sequences in the GenBank database by multiple alignments and
was also analyzed by bioinformatics software to construct a phylogenetic tree.
Results: The results revealed that the bacterial isolate 3A had genetically
closed relation to Staphylococcus pasteuri with <97% maximum identity. Data
derived from the phylogenetic tree revealed that the bacterial isolate 3A was
also related to Staphylococcus warneri, yet, it shows a different evolutionary
distance with the ancestors (S. pasteuri).
Conclusion: The results of this research suggested that the bacterium 3A,
isolated from preputial swabs of healthy Aceh cattle, is a Staphylococcus
species.
