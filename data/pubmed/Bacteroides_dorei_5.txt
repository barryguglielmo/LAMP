We describe the inhibition of the starch utilization system (Sus) belonging to
various strains of Bacteroides dorei in a non-lethal manner using the small
molecule probe, acarbose. Concentrations of acarbose as low as 5 μM significantly
impede the growth of B. dorei and increase the doubling time of cultures. The
successful inhibition of this species of Bacteroides is relevant to several
disease states including type I diabetes mellitus. This method continues to
explore a new, potential route to intervene in illnesses associated with aberrant
changes in the composition of the human gut microbiota through the strategic
manipulation of its constituents.
