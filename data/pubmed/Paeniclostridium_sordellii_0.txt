Pathogenic clostridial species secrete potent toxins that induce severe host
tissue damage. Paeniclostridium sordellii lethal toxin (TcsL) causes an almost
invariably lethal toxic shock syndrome associated with gynecological infections. 
TcsL is 87% similar to C. difficile TcdB, which enters host cells via Frizzled
receptors in colon epithelium. However, P. sordellii infections target vascular
endothelium, suggesting that TcsL exploits another receptor. Here, using
CRISPR/Cas9 screening, we establish semaphorins SEMA6A and SEMA6B as TcsL
receptors. We demonstrate that recombinant SEMA6A can protect mice from
TcsL-induced edema. A 3.3 Å cryo-EM structure shows that TcsL binds SEMA6A with
the same region that in TcdB binds structurally unrelated Frizzled. Remarkably,
15 mutations in this evolutionarily divergent surface are sufficient to switch
binding specificity of TcsL to that of TcdB. Our findings establish semaphorins
as physiologically relevant receptors for TcsL and reveal the molecular basis for
the difference in tissue targeting and disease pathogenesis between highly
related toxins.
