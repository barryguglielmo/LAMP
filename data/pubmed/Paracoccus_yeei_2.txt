Bacteria are known to communicate with each other through signalling molecules
that regulate gene expression within the population. However, the way in which
hydrophobic signals are released and transmitted among bacterial population is
not well understood. Recent studies show that membrane vesicles (MVs) are
involved in delivering hydrophobic signals, such as in
N-hexadecanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (C16-HSL) signalling in Paracoccus
denitrificans Pd1222. In this study, we identified the AHLs produced in
Paracoccus aminophilus JCM7686, Paracoccus aminovorans NBRC16711, Paracoccus
thiocyanatus JCM20756, Paracoccus versutus JCM20754 and Paracoccus yeei ATCC
BAA-599, and show that the main AHL produced in all the strains is C16-HSL. Our
results show that these Paracoccus species also release MVs that carry C16-HSL,
but at different proportions. Most of the strains carry C16-HSL in MVs, while in 
P. aminophilus JCM7686, very little C16-HSL was detected in MVs, but was found in
other fractions of the supernatant. Given the utilization of a common signal, we 
showed that these Paracoccus species can share signals with P. denitrificans
Pd1222, and examined the role of MVs in signalling. Our study provides new
insights into the way in which bacteria communicate using hydrophobic signals.
