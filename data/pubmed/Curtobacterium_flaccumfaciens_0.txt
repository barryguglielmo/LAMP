Bacterial wilt of dry beans (family Fabaceae) caused by the actinobacterial agent
Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. flaccumfaciens (Cff) is one of the most
important diseases threatening edible legume production around the globe. Despite
the economic losses due to the bacterial wilt disease, the pathogen has not so
far been investigated for its genomic features, pathogenicity determinants and
virulence strategies. Here we present the first complete genome sequence of a
highly virulent bacteriocin-producing Cff strain P990. The bacterium has a
circular chromosome consisting 3,736 kbp with the G+C% content of 71.0%.
Furthermore, a 147 kbp circular plasmid (pCff1) with 66.1% G+C% content as well
as two circular plasmid-like DNAs with the size of 25 kbp and 22 kbp were
detected within the genomic contents of Cff. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that 
only a few number of Curtobacterium sp. strains deposited in the public databases
could be classified within the species C. flaccumfaciens. Comparative genomics of
Cff using the genome sequences of actinobacterial plant pathogens revealed the
presence of a set of unique low G+C% content genomic islands in the Cff genome.
Homologues of pathogenicity-determinant loci capable of producing
1,4-beta-xylanase (xysA), pectate lyase (pelA1 and pelA2), serine protease (chpC,
chpG, and pat-1), and sortase (srtA) were detected in Cff genome. The genomic
data presented here extends our understanding of the Cff genomic features and
pave the ways of research on functional and interaction genetics to combat the
risk of bacterial wilt disease in the 21st Century's dry bean industry.
