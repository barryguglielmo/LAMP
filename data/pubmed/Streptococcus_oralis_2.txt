An 81-year-old man with a history of gingival bleeding presented with a fever,
headache, and drowsiness. His mouth and full dentures were unsanitary. Laboratory
tests revealed Streptococcus oralis meningitis caused by odontogenic bacteremia. 
We reviewed eight reported cases, including the present case, because S. oralis
meningitis is rare. Our review indicated that S. oralis meningitis needs to be
considered when encountering cases of a fever, disturbance of consciousness, and 
headache with episodes of possible odontogenic bacteremia.
