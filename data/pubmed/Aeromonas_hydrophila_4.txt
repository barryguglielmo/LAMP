RTX adhesins are long, multi-domain proteins present on the outer membrane of
many Gram-negative bacteria. From this vantage point, adhesins use their distal
ligand-binding domains for surface attachment leading to biofilm formation. To
expand the reach of the ligand-binding domains, RTX adhesins maintain a central
extender region of multiple tandem repeats, which makes up most of the proteins' 
large molecular weight. Alignments of the 10-15-kDa extender domains show low
sequence identity between adhesins. Here we have produced and structurally
characterized protein constructs of four tandem repeats (tetra-tandemers) from
two different RTX adhesins. In comparing the tetra-tandemers to each other and
already solved structures from Marinomonas primoryensis and Salmonella enterica, 
the extender domains fold as diverse beta-sandwich structures with widely
differing calcium contents. However, all the tetra-tandemers have at least one
calcium ion coordinated in the linker region between beta-sandwich domains whose 
role appears to be the rigidification of the extender region to help the adhesin 
extend its reach.
