The probiotic potential of Pediococcus acidilactici isolated from Wara, a
Nigerian unripened soft cheese from cow milk was investigated in this study. The 
strain was evaluated for tolerance to low pH, bile salts, high osmotic pressure, 
exopolysaccharide production, auto-aggregation, microbial adhesion to solvent,
survival in simulated gastro-intestinal juice and antimicrobial properties. The
strain showed resistance to high acid and bile conditions surviving at pH 2 and
1.5% bile salt concentration. The strain survived at 8% Sodium chloride and
produced exopolysaccharide. P. acidilactici possessed high auto-aggregative
ability and hydrophobicity (>70%). Furthermore, the strain did not show hemolytic
activity and survived in the presence of simulated gastric juice at pH 2 and
simulated intestinal juice. The strain exhibited a broad spectrum inhibition
against pathogens. The study concluded that P. acidilactici strain isolated from 
wara could be a useful probiotic for the development of functional food products.
