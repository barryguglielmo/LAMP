The strain Pseudomonas putida BS3701 was isolated from soil contaminated with
coke by-product waste (Moscow Region, Russian Federation). It is capable of
degrading crude oil and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The P. putida
BS3701 genome consists of a 6,337,358-bp circular chromosome and two circular
plasmids (pBS1141 with 107,388 bp and pBS1142 with 54,501 bp).
