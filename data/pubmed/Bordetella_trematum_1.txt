We report the case of isolation of Bordetella trematum from the respiratory tract
of a patient with lung carcinoma. This gram-negative, opportunistic rod was
firstly described in 1996. To date, only several strains of Bordetella trematum
have been isolated and reported, mostly from skin and soft tissue infections. The
patient was admitted to the ICU of the Pulmonary Department in incipient septic
shock with respiratory failure. Intravenous fluid resuscitation and non-invasive 
ventilation were administered immediately. A broad spectrum antibiotic
piperacillin/tazobactam was administered empirically after sampling of material
for microbiological examination. The bronchoscopy showed a large cavern of
decayed tumour invading into mediastinum. Both sample cultures showed significant
quantities of gram-negative non-fermenting bacteria. The isolate was identified
using MALDI-TOF MS as Bordetella trematum and the identification was confirmed
using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. In the last few years, routine bacterial
identification using MALDI-TOF MS has enabled correct discrimination of this
species. Nevertheless, isolation of Bordetella trematum in clinical samples is
still very uncommon, and it is appropriate to confirm the species identification 
via 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. To our knowledge, this is the first case of B. 
trematum isolated from the human respiratory tract since its first description.
The clinical significance of Bordetella trematum in the rapid deterioration of
the patient's status remains unclear.
