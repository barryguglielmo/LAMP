Fourteen Gram-stain-positive bacterial strains were isolated from Chinese
traditional pickle and yogurt. The strains were characterized using a polyphasic 
taxonomic approach, including 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, pheS gene sequence
analysis, rpoA gene sequence analysis, fatty acid methyl ester analysis,
determination of DNA G+C content, determination of average nucleotide identity
(ANI), in silico DNA-DNA hybridization (isDDH) and an analysis of phenotypic
features. The data demonstrated that the 14 strains represented ten novel species
belonging to the genus Lactobacillus, strains 73-4T, 247-3T, 143-4(a)T, 33-1T,
143-6T, 247-4T, 17-4T, 143-1T, 735-2T and M1530-1T were designated as the type
strains. Strains 73-4T and 247-3T were phylogenetically related to the type
strains of Lactobacillus camelliae and Lactobacillus jixianensis, having
97.0-98.9 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities, 83.9-87.2 % pheS gene sequence
similarities and 86.8-93.3 % rpoA gene sequence similarities. Strains 143-4(a)T
and 33-1T were phylogenetically related to the type strains of Lactobacillus
rhamnosus, Lactobacillus paracasei and Lactobacillus casei, having 93.6-96.5 %
16S rRNA gene sequence similarities, 73.9-77.2 % pheS gene sequence similarities 
and 76.1-77.6 % rpoA gene sequence similarities. Strains 143-6T, 247-4T, 17-4T
and 143-1T were phylogenetically related to the type strains of Lactobacillus
concavus, Lactobacillus dextrinicus and Lactobacillus bayanensis, exhibiting
95.5-99.9 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities, 76.5-83.1 % pheS gene sequence
similarities and 83.6-98.3 % rpoA gene sequence similarities. Strain 735-2T was
phylogenetically related to the type strains of Lactobacillus zhaoyuanensis,
Lactobacillus jiayinensis and Lactobacillus coryniformis, having 98.2-99.1 % 16S 
rRNA gene sequence similarities, 82.8-84.1 % pheS gene sequence similarities and 
93.0-93.9 % rpoA gene sequence similarities. Strain M1530-1T was phylogenetically
related to the type strains of Lactobacillus suantsaiihabitans and Lactobacillus 
brevis, having 99.5 and 99.0 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities, 90.3 and
81.7 % pheS gene sequence similarities and 97.7 and 91.1 % rpoA gene sequence
similarities. The ANI and isDDH values between strains 73-4T, 247-3T, 143-4(a)T, 
33-1T, 143-6T, 247-4T, 17-4T, 143-1T, 735-2T, M1530-1T and type strains of
phylogenetically related species were less than 86.8 % and 33.9 % respectively,
confirming that they represent ten novel species within the genus Lactobacillus. 
Based upon the data of polyphasic characterization obtained in the present study,
ten novel species, Lactobacillus hegangensis sp. nov., Lactobacillus suibinensis 
sp. nov., Lactobacillus daqingensis sp. nov., Lactobacillus yichunensis sp. nov.,
Lactobacillus mulanensis sp. nov., Lactobacillus achengensis sp. nov.,
Lactobacillus wuchangensis sp. nov., Lactobacillus gannanensis sp. nov.,
Lactobacillus binensis sp. nov. and Lactobacillus angrenensis sp. nov., are
proposed and the type strains are 73-4T (=NCIMB 15177T=CCM 8912T=CCTCC AB
2018407T), 247-3T (=NCIMB 15176T=JCM 33275T), 143-4(a)T (=NCIMB 15173T=CCM
8948T=JCM 33273T=CCTCC AB 2018390T), 33-1T (=NCIMB 15169T=CCM 8947T=JCM
33272T=CCTCC AB 2018405T), 143-6T (=NCIMB 15162T=CCM 8951T=JCM 33274T=CCTCC AB
2018411T), 247-4T (=NCIMB 15155T=CCM 8897T=LMG 31059T=CCTCC AB 2018410T), 17-4T
(=NCIMB 15161T=CCM 8946T=JCM 33271T=CCTCC AB 2018406T), 143-1T (=NCIMB 15157T=CCM
8937T=CCTCC AB 2018409T), 735-2T (=NCIMB 15190T=CCM 8925T=LMG 31186T) and
M1530-1T (=NCIMB 15150T=CCM 8893T=LMG 31046T=CCTCC AB 2018402T), respectively.
