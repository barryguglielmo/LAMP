Staphylococcal infection is one of the most pressing problems in modern medicine 
due to the increasing antibiotic resistance with the overuse of antibiotics.
Conventional methods for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing 
(AST) generally take 3-7 days and require skilled technicians. In this study, a
microfluidic device based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was
developed, which could discriminate Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus
epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Staphylococcus hominis and predict 
their methicillin resistance by targeting the mecA and femA genes within 70 min
including the hands-on time. Multiplex and real-time detection was achieved in a 
closed system without aerosol contamination. The limits of detection (LODs) for
S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hominis, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)
were 20 CFU/reaction, while that for S. haemolyticus was 200 CFU/reaction. A
total of 102 positive cultures of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were also tested, and
the results were in good agreement with those from conventional methods.
Furthermore, mixed cultures were readily identified by our method. The portable
and integrated device is rapid, accurate, and easy to use, which can provide
information for prompt institution of proper antimicrobial therapy and has great 
potential for clinical applications, especially in resource-limited settings.
