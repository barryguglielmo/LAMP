The biorecognition ability of hybridized toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2 and 6
proteins on electrode surfaces has been studied. TLR biosensors have been
designed to be non-specific to particular bacterial strains but rather to provide
broad spectrum detection of cells and toxins containing relevant
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Our electrochemical TLR2/6
biosensors demonstrated selective detection towards Gram-positive bacterial
whole-cells and a synthetic diacylated lipopeptide (Pam2CSK4), a PAMP. Responses 
towards Bacillus licheniformis (B. licheniformis) and Enterococcus hirae (E.
hirae) were obtained. The biosensor was able to differentiate signals between B. 
licheniformis and a Gram-negative bacterial cell (control) as low as 100 CFU
mL-1. One challenge in developing protein-based biosensors is to improve the
shelf-life of the biosensor chips and preserve the detection activity of the
protein molecules, therefore we did our first exploration into storage
conditions. The activity of stored biosensors was found to be strongly dependent 
on storage medium, and that effective 'shelf-life' was obtained makes an
important step towards creating robust sensors for real-life applications.
