Activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2), a member of the bZIP transcription
factor family, is involved in multiple physiological and developmental processes,
yet its role in the innate immunity remains unclear. In this study, two isoforms 
(named as MnATF2a and MnATF2b) of ATF2 gene were identified in Macrobrachium
nipponense and were produced by exon skipping. The full length of MnATF2a is 2328
bp with an open reading frame of 2079 bp that encode 692 amino acids. MnATF2a has
237 bp nucleotides more than MnATF2b and the extra 237 bp is a complete exon.
MnATF2a and MnATF2b proteins contain the same conserved and typical bZIP domain
at the C-terminus. MnATF2a has 79 amino acids more than MnATF2b. MnATF2a and
MnATF2b are widely distributed in a variety of immune tissues. After Vibrio
parahaemolyticus and Staphylococcus aureus infection, the expression levels of
MnATF2a and MnATF2b were significant up-regulated in the gills and stomach at
12 h. RNA interference analysis showed that knockdown of the total MnATF2 gene
significantly inhibits the transcription of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and
promotes the expression of crustins (including Cru3, Cru4, and Cru7). Further
study showed that knockdown of MnTNF evidently increase the expression of Cru3,
Cru4, and Cru7. Our research indicates that ATF2 negatively regulate the
expression of AMPs by regulating the transcription of TNF in M. nipponense. This 
study provides valuable information about the function of ATF2 family in the
innate immunity in crustacean.
