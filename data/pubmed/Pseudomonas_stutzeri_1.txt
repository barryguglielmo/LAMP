<i>Pseudomonas stutzeri </i> CM1, Novel Thermotolerant Cellulase- Producing
Bacteria Isolated from Forest Soil.

Rattanasuk S, Songsaeng A, Sriwarom T.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Cellulase is an important enzyme that useful for
agricultural residue hydrolysis such as plant stover, molasse, rice straw.
Thermotolerant cellulases are required to apply in textile, food, detergent,
biofuels and pharmaceutical applications. This research aimed to isolate the
thermotolerant cellulase-producing bacteria from forest soil and to determine
cellulase activity from isolated bacteria.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Soil samples were collected from the Roi Et Rajabhat
University forest. One gram of soil sample was mixed with Luria-Bertani (LB)
broth medium and incubated at 37째C with shaking at 150 rpm for 24 h. The cultured
broth was streaked on LB agar plate and incubated at 37째C for 24 h.
Cellulase-producing bacteria were isolated using Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)
agar plate. Four bacterial isolates which presented a clear zone on CMC agar
plate after flooded with iodine solution, named CM1, CM2, CM3 and CM4. Cellulase 
activity of 4 isolated bacteria was determined against various pH (pH 4-8) and
temperature (50-100째C).
RESULTS: The results indicated that CM1 isolate showed the highest cellulase
activity at 0.074 unit mL-1 at 80째C and pH5. All isolates were identified using
16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results indicated that CM1, CM3 and CM4 were
identified as Pseudomonas stutzeri. while isolate CM2 was Bacillus subtilis.
CONCLUSION: This is the first report presenting the thermotolerant cellulase
produced by Pseudomonas stutzeri. The thermotolerant cellulase produced from
Pseudomonas stutzeri in this study will be useful in many industrial processes
using cellulase at high temperatures.
