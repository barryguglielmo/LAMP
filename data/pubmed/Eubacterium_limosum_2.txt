Hops is an almost unique source of the potent phytoestrogen 8-prenylnaringenin
(8-PN). As hops contain only low levels of 8-PN, synthesis may be more attractive
than extraction. A strain of the Gram-positive Eubacterium limosum was isolated
previously for 8-PN production from more abundant precursor isoxanthohumol (IX)
from hops. In this study, spent hops, an industrial side stream from the beer
industry, was identified as interesting source of IX. Yet, hop-derived compounds 
are well-known antibacterial agents and the traces of a large variety of
different compounds in spent hops interfered with growth and IX conversion.
Critical factors to finally enable bacterial 8-PN production from spent hops,
using a food and feed grade medium, were evaluated in this research. The use of
bacterial resting cells and complex medium at aÂ pH of 7.8-8 best fulfilled the
requirements for 8-PN production and generated a solid basis for development of
an economic process.
