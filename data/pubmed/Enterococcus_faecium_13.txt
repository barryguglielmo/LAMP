BACKGROUND: Currently, hospitals have been forced to divert substantial resources
to cope with the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. It is
unclear if this situation will affect long-standing infection prevention
practices and impact on healthcare associated infections. Here, we report a
nosocomial cluster of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) that occurred on a
COVID-19 dedicated intensive care unit (ICU) despite intensified contact
precautions during the current pandemic. Whole genome sequence-based typing (WGS)
was used to investigate genetic relatedness of VRE isolates collected from
COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients during the outbreak and to compare them to
environmental VRE samples.
METHODS: Five VRE isolated from patients (three clinical and two screening
samples) as well as 11 VRE and six vancomycin susceptible Enterococcus faecium
(E. faecium) samples from environmental sites underwent WGS during the outbreak
investigation. Isolate relatedness was determined using core genome multilocus
sequence typing (cgMLST).
RESULTS: WGS revealed two genotypic distinct VRE clusters with genetically
closely related patient and environmental isolates. The cluster was terminated by
enhanced infection control bundle strategies.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results illustrate the importance of continued adherence to
infection prevention and control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic to prevent
VRE transmission and healthcare associated infections.
