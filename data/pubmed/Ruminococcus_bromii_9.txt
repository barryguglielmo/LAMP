Resistant starch type 2 (RS2), a dietary fiber comprised solely of glucose, has
been extensively studied in clinical trials and animal models for its capacity to
improve metabolic and systemic health. Because the health modulatory effects of
RS2 and other dietary fibers are thought to occur through modification of the gut
microbiome, those studies frequently include assessments of RS2-mediated changes 
to intestinal microbial composition and function. In this review, we identify the
conserved responses of the gut microbiome among 13 human and 35 animal RS2
intervention studies. Consistent outcomes of RS2 interventions include reductions
in bacterial α-diversity; increased production of lumenal short-chain fatty
acids; and enrichment of Ruminococcus bromii, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, and
other gut taxa. Different taxa are usually responsive in animal models, and many 
RS2-mediated changes to the gut microbiome vary within and between studies. The
root causes for this variation are examined with regard to methodological and
analytical differences, host genetics and age, species differences (eg, human,
animal), health status, intervention dose and duration, and baseline microbial
composition. The significant variation found for this single dietary compound
highlights the challenges in targeting the gut microbiome to improve health with 
dietary interventions. This knowledge on RS2 also provides opportunities to
improve the design of nutrition studies targeting the gut microbiome and to
ultimately identify the precise mechanisms via which dietary fiber benefits human
health.
