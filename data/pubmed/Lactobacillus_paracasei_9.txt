BACKGROUND: Most women experience a urinary tract infection (UTI) at least once
in their lifetime. The present study determined the efficacy and safety of a
combination of Lactobacillus paracasei LC11, cranberry and D-mannose
(Lactoflorene Cist®) in the prophylaxis of recurrent uncomplicated UTIs in
premenopausal women.
METHODS: This single-centre study enrolled premenopausal women aged 18-50 years
with an acute UTI and a history of recurrent uncomplicated UTIs. Patients were
first treated with fosfomycin (3 g once a day for 2 days) to eliminate any
underlying infection, followed by treatment with Lactoflorene Cist® once a day
for 10 days/month for 90 days (Group 1), Lactoflorene Cist® once daily for
90 days (Group 2) or no treatment (Group 3; control). The main study endpoint was
the rate of UTI recurrence during the study period. Any adverse events with
treatment were also recorded.
RESULTS: A total of 55 women (mean age 39.3 years; range: 20-46) were enrolled in
the study. A significantly higher proportion of patients in the control group
experienced UTIs during the study period compared with the two treatment groups
(52.9% vs 16.0% in Group 1 and 15.5% in group 2; p < 0.01). Similarly, a higher
proportion of patients in Group 1 (65.8%) and Group 2 (68.7%) remained UTI-free
during the study versus the control group. No adverse events were reported in the
treated patients.
CONCLUSION: Prophylactic treatment with Lactoflorene Cist® was effective and safe
in the management of recurrent uncomplicated UTIs in premenopausal women.
