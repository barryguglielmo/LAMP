We report a 1-day-old girl who was affected by peritonitis and bacteremia caused 
by Clostridium tertium following perforation of congenital intestinal atresia.
Splenic infarction was also suspected during C. tertium bacteremia. C. tertium
was identified by using mass spectrometry and 16S rRNA sequencing. This patient
was successfully treated with emergency laparotomy and broad-spectrum
antibiotics.
