BACKGROUND: Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase (ESBL) production in gram negative
bacteria confers multiple antibiotic resistance, adversely affecting
antimicrobial therapy in infected individuals. ESBLs result from mutations in
β-lactamases encoded mainly by the bla TEM,bla SHVand bla CTX-Mgenes. The
prevalence of ESBL producing bacteria has been on the increase globally
especially its upsurge among isolates from community-acquired infections.
AIM: To determine ESBL prevalence and identify ESBL genes among clinical isolates
in Osun State, Nigeria.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out from August 2016
-July 2017 in Osun State, Nigeria. Three hundred and sixty Gram negative bacteria
recovered from clinical samples obtained from both community and healthcare
associated infections were tested. They included147 Escherichia coli(40.8%), 116 
Klebsiella spp(32.2%), 44 Pseudomo-nas aeruginosa(12.2%) and23 Proteus vulgaris
(6.4%) isolates. Others were Acinetobacter baumannii, Serratia rubidae,
Citrobacter spp, Enterobacter spp and Salmonella typhi. Disk diffusion antibiotic
susceptibility testing was carried out, isolates were screened for ESBL
production and confirmed using standard laboratory procedures. ESBLs resistance
genes were identified by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).
RESULTS: All isolates demonstrated multiple antibiotic resistance. Resistance to 
ampicillin, amoxicillin with clavulanate and erythromycin was 100%, whereas
resistance to Imipenem was very low (5.0%). Overall prevalence of ESBL producers 
was 41.4% with Klebsiellaspp as the highest ESBL producing Enterobacteriacaea.
ESBL producers were more prevalent among the hospital pathogens than community
pathogens, 58% vs 29.5% (p=0.003). ESBL genes were detected in all ESBL producers
with the blaCTX-Mgene predominating (47.0%) followed by blaTEM(30.9%) and
blaSHVgene was the least, 22.1%. The blaCTX-Mgene was also the most prevalent in 
the healthcare pathogens (62%) but it accounted for only 25% in those of
community origin.
CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of ESBL producing gram negative organisms occurs
both in healthcare and in the community in our environment with the CTX-M variant
predominating. Efforts to control spread of these pathogens should be addressed.
