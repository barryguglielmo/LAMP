Using microbial culturomics, three Bacillus strains were isolated, identified and
characterized following the taxonogenomics strategy. Bacillus dakarensis strain
Marseille-P3515T (=CSURP3515), Bacillus sinesaloumensis strain Marseille-P3516T
(=CSURP3516), and Bacillus massiliogabonensis strain Marseille-P2639T
(=CSURP2639) were isolated from human stool samples. The phylogenetic analysis,
phenotypic characteristics and genotypic data presented here prove that these
three bacteria are different from previously known bacterial species with
standing in nomenclature and represent new Bacillus species.
