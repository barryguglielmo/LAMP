PURPOSE: We aim to describe ocular infection epidemiology for a public tertiary
care hospital in New York City (NYC).
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 558 patients with ocular isolates from
conjunctival, corneal, and intraocular culture from 2009 to 2017 for microbial
growth and antimicrobial sensitivities.
RESULTS: In total, 185 ocular cultures (33%) had growth and the most commonly
isolated microbes overall were Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (23%),
coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) (23%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P.
aeruginosa) (16%), and Streptococcus viridans (S. viridans) group (11%). The most
common microbes within corneal (n = 61), conjunctival (n = 34), and intraocular
isolates (n = 9) were P. aeruginosa (37.7%), S. aureus (35.3%), and S. viridans
group (33.3%), respectively. Proportion of isolates exhibiting multi-drug
resistance decreased over time (P = .006).
CONCLUSIONS: The microbial epidemiology of ocular infection of a public NYC
hospital was distinct from other geographic locations, underscoring the
importance of examining local profiles to more precisely inform empiric therapy.
