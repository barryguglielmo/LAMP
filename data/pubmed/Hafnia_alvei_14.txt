Use of new generation probiotics may become an integral part of the prevention
and treatment strategies of obesity. The aim of the present study was to test the
efficacy of a potential probiotic strain of lactic bacteria Hafnia alvei (H.
alvei) HA4597™, in a mouse model of obesity characterized by both hyperphagia and
diet-induced adiposity. For this purpose, 10-week-old high-fat-diet (HFD)-fed
hyperphagic ob/ob male mice received a daily treatment with 1.4 × 1010 CFU of H. 
alvei for 38 days. Effects of H. alvei were compared to those of a lipase
inhibitor orlistat (80 mg/kg daily) and a vehicle (NaCl 0.9%) in HFD-fed ob/ob
mice. A control untreated group of ob/ob mice received the standard diet
throughout the experiment. The vehicle-treated HFD group displayed increased food
intake, worsening of adiposity, and glycemia. Treatment with H. alvei was
accompanied by decreased body weight and fat-mass gain along with reduced food
intake to the level of the standard-diet-fed mice. At the end of the experiment, 
the group treated with H. alvei showed a decrease of glycemia, plasma total
cholesterol, and alanine aminotransferase. The orlistat-treated mice showed a
lower rate of body weight gain but were hyperphagic and hyperglycemic. These
results demonstrate the beneficial anti-obesity and metabolic effects of H. alvei
HA4597™ in mice with obesity resulting from hyperphagia and diet-induced
adiposity.
