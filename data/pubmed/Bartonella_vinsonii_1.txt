The number of recognized flea-borne pathogens has increased over the past decade.
However, the true number of infections related to all flea-borne pathogens
remains unknown. To better understand the enzootic cycle of flea-borne pathogens,
fleas were sampled from small mammals trapped in central Pennsylvania. A total of
541 small mammals were trapped, with white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) and 
southern red-backed voles (Myodes gapperi) accounting for over 94% of the
captures. Only P. leucopus were positive for examined blood-borne pathogens, with
47 (18.1%) and ten (4.8%) positive for Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia
microti, respectively. In addition, 61 fleas were collected from small mammals
and tested for pathogens. Orchopeas leucopus was the most common flea and
Bartonella vinsonii subspecies arupensis, B. microti, and a Rickettsia felis-like
bacterium were detected in various flea samples. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first report of B. microti DNA detected from a flea and the first
report of a R. felis-like bacterium from rodent fleas in eastern North America.
This study provides evidence of emerging pathogens found in fleas, but further
investigation is required to resolve the ecology of flea-borne disease
transmission cycles.
