Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. flaccumfaciens (Cff) is the causal agent of
bacterial wilt of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), a disease that can reduce
yields of this economically important crop worldwide. Current genomics resources 
for this important bacterial pathogen are limited. Therefore, long-read
sequencing was used to determine the complete genome sequence of a pathogenic Cff
strain isolated from common bean leaves showing irregular necrotic lesions with
yellow borders collected in a commercial field in Turkey in 2015.
