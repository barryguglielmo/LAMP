Pulque is a culturally important 4,000-year-old traditional Mexican fermented
drink. Pulque is produced by adding fresh aguamiel (agave sap) to mature pulque, 
resulting in a mixture of microbial communities and chemical compositions. We
performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing of five stages of pulque fermentation to
characterize organismal and functional diversity. We identified 6 genera
(Acinetobacter, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Saccharomyces and
Zymomonas) and 10 species (Acinetobacter boissieri, Acinetobacter nectaris,
Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus piscium,
Lactococcus plantarum, Leuconostoc citreum, Leuconostoc gelidum, Zymomonas
mobilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) that were present ≥ 1% in at least one
stage of pulque fermentation. The abundance of genera and species changed during 
fermentation and was associated with a decrease in sucrose and increases in
ethanol and lactic acid, suggesting that resource competition shapes organismal
diversity. We also predicted functional profiles, based on organismal gene
content, for each fermentation stage and identified an abundance of genes
associated with the biosynthesis of folate, an essential B-vitamin. Additionally,
we investigated the evolutionary relationships of S. cerevisiae and Z. mobilis,
two of the major microbial species found in pulque. For S. cerevisiae, we used a 
metagenomics assembly approach to identify S. cerevisiae scaffolds from pulque,
and performed phylogenetic analysis of these sequences along with a collection of
158 S. cerevisiae strains. This analysis suggests that S. cerevisiae from pulque 
is most closely related to Asian strains isolated from sake and bioethanol.
Lastly, we isolated and sequenced the whole-genomes of three strains of Z.
mobilis from pulque and compared their relationship to seven previously sequenced
isolates. Our results suggest pulque strains may represent a distinct lineage of 
Z. mobilis.
