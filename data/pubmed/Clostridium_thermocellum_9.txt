Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) play an important role in the
degradation of complex polysaccharides in lignocellulosic biomass. In the present
study, we characterized a modular LPMO (PcAA10A), consisting of a family 10
auxiliary activity of LPMO (AA10) catalytic domain, and non-catalytic domains
including a family 5 carbohydrate-binding module, two fibronectin type-3 domains,
and a family 3 carbohydrate-binding module from Paenibacillus curdlanolyticus
B-6, which was expressed in a recombinant Escherichia coli. Comparison of
activities between full-length PcAA10A and the catalytic domain polypeptide
(PcAA10A_CD) indicates that the non-catalytic domains are important for the
deconstruction of crystalline cellulose and complex polysaccharides contained in 
untreated lignocellulosic biomass. Interestingly, PcAA10A_CD acted not only on
cellulose and chitin, but also on xylan, mannan, and xylan and cellulose
contained in lignocellulosic biomass, which has not been reported for the AA10
family. Mutation of the key residues, Trp51 located at subsite - 2 and Phe171
located at subsite +2, in the substrate-binding site of PcAA10A_CD revealed that 
these residues are substantially involved in broad substrate specificity toward
cellulose, xylan, and mannan, albeit with a low effect toward chitin.
Furthermore, PcAA10A had a boosting effect on untreated corn hull degradation by 
P. curdlanolyticus B-6 endo-xylanase Xyn10D and Clostridium thermocellum
endo-glucanase Cel9A. These results suggest that PcAA10A is a unique LPMO capable
of cleaving and enhancing lignocellulosic biomass degradation, making it a good
candidate for biotechnological applications. KEY POINTS: • PcAA10A is a novel
modular LPMO family 10 from Paenibacillus curdlanolyticus. • PcAA10A showed broad
substrate specificity on β-1,4 glycosidic linkage substrates. • Non-catalytic
domains are important for degrading complex polysaccharides. • PcAA10A is a
unique LPMO capable of enhancing lignocellulosic biomass degradation.
