Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum biofilm bactericidal
concentration (MBBC) values of eravacycline against 185 staphylococci from
periprosthetic joint infections were determined. Staphylococcus aureus had MICs
of ≤0.25 μg/ml. MICs for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus
epidermidis were ≤1 and ≤2 μg/ml, respectively. S. aureus and S. epidermidis
MBBC50 and MBBC90 values were 8 and 16 μg/ml for each, showing poor
anti-staphylococcal biofilm activity using the method studied.
