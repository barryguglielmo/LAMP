Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (ATCC 53103) and Bifidobacterium longum NCC 2705 are
among the most studied probiotics. However, the first evidence of acyl
hydrolase/lipase of two annotated proteins, one in each genome of these strains, 
is reported in this work. Signal peptide analysis has predicted that these
proteins are exported to the extracellular medium. Both proteins were produced in
Escherichia coli, purified and characterized. Molecular masses (without signal
peptides) were 27 and 52.3 kDa for the proteins of L. rhamnosus and B. longum,
respectively. Asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation analysis has shown that 
both proteins are present as monomers in their native forms at pH 7. Both have
shown enzymatic activity on pNP-laurate at pH 7 and 37°C. The enzyme from L.
rhamnosus was characterized deeper, showing preference on pNP-esters with short
chain fatty acids. In addition, a computational model of the 3D structure has
allowed the prediction of the catalytic amino acids. The enzymatic activities
using synthetic substrates were very low for both enzymes. The investigation of
natural substrates and biological functions of these enzymes is still open.
