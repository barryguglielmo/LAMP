ABSTRACT: In April 2017, an outbreak of histamine fish poisoning causing illness 
in nine victims associated with consumption of milkfish surimi products (fish
ball) occurred in Kaohsiung City, southern Taiwan. Of the two suspected frozen
milkfish surimi samples, one sample contained 91.06 mg/100 g of histamine, levels
that are greater than the potential hazard action level (50 mg/100 g) in most
illness cases. Moreover, 28 frozen milkfish surimi samples from retail stores
were collected and tested to determine the occurrence of histamine. One (3.6%) of
28 commercial surimi samples had histamine levels greater than the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) guideline for decomposition of 5 mg/100 g for scombroid
fish and/or products. Thirteen histamine-producing bacterial strains isolated
from suspected and commercial surimi samples were identified as prolific
histamine formers, able to produce 98.4 to 121.8 mg/100 mL of histamine in
Trypticase soy broth supplemented with 1.0% l-histidine. In addition, milkfish
surimi was inoculated with Raoultella ornithinolytica at 5.0 log CFU/g and stored
at 4, 15, 25, and 37°C to investigate bacterial growth and formation of
histamine. The histamine contents quickly increased to more than 50 mg/100 g in
samples stored at 37 and 25°C within 12 and 24 h, respectively, as well those
stored at 15°C within 96 h. To our knowledge, this is the first report in Taiwan 
to demonstrate that milkfish surimi products could cause histamine intoxication.
