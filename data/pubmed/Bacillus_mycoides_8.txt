Bacillus sp. strain QHF158, a Gram-positive, spore-forming and parasporal
crystal-secreting bacterium, was isolated from soil of Limushan National Forest
Park in China. Here we present the significant feature of parasporal inclusions
of this organism, together with the draft genome sequence and annotation.
Phylogenetic analysis suggested that strain QHF158 is possibly a novel species,
most closely related to Bacillus mycoides. Genome annotation results revealed
that strain QHF158 did not contain any typical Cry or Cyt toxin coding gene.
Furthermore, the mass spectrometry analyses demonstrated that the parasporal
crystalline inclusions were encoded by the orf_05273 gene, with 95% similarity to
the S-layer protein (SLP) EA1 of B. mycoides, which indicated that the parasporal
crystal from Bacillus sp. strain QHF158 was mainly formed by SLP, instead of the 
typical Cry or Cyt toxin proteins.
