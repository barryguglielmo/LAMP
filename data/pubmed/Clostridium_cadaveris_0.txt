We report the draft genome sequence of a new Clostridium cadaveris strain,
AGRFS2.2, isolated from soil in a bovine dairy farm environment in New Zealand.
The genome is 3.6 Mbp long with a GC content of 31.3%. The genome sequence was
found to be closely related to that of Clostridium cadaveris JCM 1392T.
