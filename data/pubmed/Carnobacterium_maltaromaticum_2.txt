Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have a strong mitigation potential as adjunct cultures
to inhibit undesirable bacteria in fermented foods. In fresh cheese with low salt
concentration, spoilage and pathogenic bacteria can affect the shelf life with
smear on the surface and packaging blowing. In this work, we studied the spoilage
microbiota of an Italian fresh cheese to find tailor-made protective cultures for
its shelf life improvement. On 14-tested LAB, three of them, namely
Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus LRH05, Latilactobacillus sakei LSK04, and
Carnobacterium maltaromaticum CNB06 were the most effective in inhibiting
Gram-negative bacteria. These cultures were assessed by the cultivation-dependent
and DNA metabarcoding approach using in vitro experiments and industrial trials. 
Soft cheese with and without adjunct cultures were prepared and stored at 8 and
14 °C until the end of the shelf life in modified atmosphere packaging. Data
demonstrated that the use of adjunct cultures reduce and/or modulate the growth
of spoilage microbiota at both temperatures. Particularly, during industrial
experiments, C. maltaromaticum CNB06 and Lcb. rhamnosus RH05 lowered
psychrotrophic bacteria of almost 3 Log CFU/g in a 5-week stored cheese. On the
contrary, Llb. sakei LSK04 was able to colonize the cheese but it was not a good 
candidate for its inhibition capacity. The combined approach applied in this work
allowed to evaluate the protective potential of LAB strains against Gram-negative
communities.
