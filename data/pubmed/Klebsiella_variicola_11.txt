Introduction. Transmission of Enterobacterales in neonatal intensive care units
(NICU) can cause outbreaks of colonization and invasive infections among
neonates. Two clusters of nosocomial transmission of Klebsiella pneumoniae
identified by MALDI-ToF mass-spectrometry were suspected at two NICUs in July and
August 2016.Aim. To assess the potential transmission of K. pneumoniae among
neonates.Methodology. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed of K.
pneumoniae isolates obtained through targeted surveillance of patients and
environmental sampling.Results. WGS data revealed that patient and environmental 
isolates represented two species, K. pneumoniae and K. variicola. Core-genome
multi-locus sequence typing (cgMLST) of the isolates identified three separate
transmission clusters, in Hospital A a cluster of K. pneumoniae isolates in 12
children and two environmental samples and a second cluster of K. variicola
isolates in five children. In Hospital B a cluster of K. pneumoniae isolates from
three children and five unrelated isolates of K. pneumoniae and two unrelated
isolates of K. variicola were found.Conclusion. K. variicola can cause hospital
outbreaks of colonization and infection similar to other Klebsiella
spp.Preliminary results from this study were presented at the 27th European
Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, April 22-25, 2018,
Vienna, Austria.
