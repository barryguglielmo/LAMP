The main aim of the study was to investigate the chemical composition,
antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antibiofilm activity of Citrus aurantium
essential oil (CAEO). The biofilm profile of Stenotrophonomonas maltophilia and
Bacillus subtilis were assessed using the mass spectrometry MALDI-TOF MS Biotyper
and the antibiofilm activity of Citrus aurantium (CAEO) was studied on wood and
glass surfaces. A semi-quantitative composition using a modified version was
applied for the CAEO characterization. The antioxidant activity of CAEO was
determined using the DPPH method. The antimicrobial activity was analyzed by disc
diffusion for two biofilm producing bacteria, while the vapor phase was used for 
three penicillia. The antibiofilm activity was observed with the agar
microdilution method. The molecular differences of biofilm formation on different
days were analyzed, and the genetic similarity was studied with dendrograms
constructed from MSP spectra to illustrate the grouping profiles of S.
maltophilia and B. subtilis. A differentiated branch was obtained for early
growth variants of S. maltophilia for planktonic cells and all experimental
groups. The time span can be reported for the grouping pattern of B. subtilis
preferentially when comparing to the media matrix, but without clear differences 
among variants. Furthermore, the minimum inhibitory doses of the CAEO were
investigated against microscopic fungi. The results showed that CAEO was most
active against Penicillium crustosum, in the vapor phase, on bread and carrot in 
situ.
