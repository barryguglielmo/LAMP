Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) and X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) are
primary antibody deficiencies characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia and
recurrent infections, which can lead to structural airway disease (AD) and
interstitial lung disease (ILD). We investigated associations between serum IgA, 
oropharyngeal microbiota composition and severity of lung disease in these
patients. In this cross-sectional multicentre study we analyzed oropharyngeal
microbiota composition of 86 CVID patients, 12 XLA patients and 49 healthy
controls (HC) using next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. qPCR was
used to estimate bacterial load. IgA was measured in serum. High resolution CT
scans were scored for severity of AD and ILD. Oropharyngeal bacterial load was
increased in CVID patients with low IgA (p = 0.013) and XLA (p = 0.029) compared 
to HC. IgA status was associated with distinct beta (between-sample) diversity (p
= 0.039), enrichment of (Allo)prevotella, and more severe radiographic lung
disease (p = 0.003), independently of recent antibiotic use. AD scores were
positively associated with Prevotella, Alloprevotella, and Selenomonas, and ILD
scores with Streptococcus and negatively with Rothia. In clinically stable
patients with CVID and XLA, radiographic lung disease was associated with IgA
deficiency and expansion of distinct oropharyngeal bacterial taxa. Our findings
highlight IgA as a potential driver of upper respiratory tract microbiota
homeostasis.
