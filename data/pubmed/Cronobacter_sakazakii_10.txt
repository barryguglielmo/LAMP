Corrosion of carbon steel by microorganisms recovered from corroded seal rings at
an offshore floating production facility was investigated. Microbial diversity
profiling revealed that communities in all sampled seal rings were dominated by
Pseudomonas genus. Nine bacterial species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa CCC-IOB1,
Pseudomonas balearica CCC-IOB3, Pseudomonas stutzeri CCC-IOB10, Citrobacter
youngae CCC-IOB9, Petrotoga mobilis CCC-SPP15, Enterobacter roggenkampii
CCC-SPP14, Enterobacter cloacae CCC-APB1, Cronobacter sakazakii CCC-APB3, and
Shewanella chilikensis CCC-APB5 were isolated from corrosion products and
identified based on 16S rRNA gene sequence. Corrosion rates induced by the
individual isolates were evaluated in artificial seawater using short term
immersion experiments at 40 °C under anaerobic conditions. P. balearica, E.
roggenkampii, and S. chilikensis, which have not been associated with
microbiologically influenced corrosion before, were further investigated at
longer exposure times to better understand their effects on corrosion of carbon
steel, using a combination of microbiological and surface analysis techniques.
The results demonstrated that all bacterial isolates triggered general and
localised corrosion of carbon steel. Differences observed in the surface
deterioration pattern by the different bacterial isolates indicated variations in
the corrosion reactions and mechanisms promoted by each isolate.
