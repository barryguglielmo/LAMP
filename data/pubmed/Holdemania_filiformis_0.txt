BACKGROUND: Alopecia areata is a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease with an
unknown etiopathogenesis. Gut microbiota has been revealed as a key modulator of 
systemic immunity.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether patients affected by alopecia universalis present
differences in gut bacteria composition compared with healthy controls and
investigate possible bacterial biomarkers of the disease.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study that involved 15 patients affected 
by alopecia universalis and 15 controls. Gut microbiome of the study subjects was
analysed by sequencing the 16SrRNA of stool samples. We searched for bacterial
biomarkers of alopecia universalis using the linear discriminant analysis effect 
size (LEFse) tool.
RESULTS: In total, 30 study subjects (46.6% female; mean [SD] age, 40.1 [9.8]
years) were enrolled. Neither alpha (Shannon diversity index 5.31 ± 0.43 vs.
5.03 ± 0.43, P 0.1) or beta diversity (ADONIS P value: 0.35) of gut microbiota
showed statistically significant differences between cases and controls. In
patients affected with alopecia, we found an enriched presence (LDA SCORE > 2) of
Holdemania filiformis, Erysipelotrichacea, Lachnospiraceae, Parabacteroides
johnsonii, Clostridiales vadin BB60 group, Bacteroides eggerthii and
Parabacteroides distasonis. A predictive model based on the number of bacterial
counts of Parabacteroides distasonis and Clostridiales vadin BB60 group correctly
predicted disease status in 80% of patients (AUC 0.804 (0.633-0.976), P 0.004).
CONCLUSION: Alopecia universalis does not seem to affect broadly gut microbiota
structure. Bacterial biomarkers found associated with the disease (Holdemania
filiformis, Erysipelotrichacea, Lachnospiraceae, Parabacteroides johnsonii,
Eggerthellaceae, Clostridiales vadin BB60 group, Bacteroides eggerthii and
Parabacteroides distasonis) should be further studied as they could be involved
in its pathophysiology or be used as diagnostic tools.
