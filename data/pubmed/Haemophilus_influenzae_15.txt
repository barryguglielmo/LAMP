The objective was to describe the epidemiology, bacteriology, clinical
presentation, risk factors for endocarditis (IE), diagnostic workup, and outcome 
of patients with bacteremia caused by the non-influenzae Haemophilus,
Aggregatibacter, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, and Kingella genera (HACEK). A
retrospective population-based cohort of patients with bacteremia collected from 
2012 to 2017 was identified. Clinical data from identified patients were
collected from medical records to classify patients, calculate incidences,
analyze risk factors of IE, and describe the management and outcome of the
cohort. A total of 118 episodes of HACEK bacteremia were identified, of which 27 
were definite IE. The incidence of HACEK bacteremia was 5.2 and of HACEK IE 1.2
episodes per 1,000,000 inhabitants per year. Other focal infections were
identified in 55 of 118 of the episodes, most commonly within the abdomen (26
episodes). The propensity to cause IE ranged from 62 in Aggregatibacter
actinomycetemcomitans to 6% in Eikenella. Risk factors for IE were cardiac
implantable electronical device, predisposing cardiac conditions, community
acquisition, long duration of symptoms, multiple positive blood cultures, fever, 
heart murmur, embolization, and unknown origin of infection. The scoring system
DENOVA developed to predict IE in bacteremia with Enterococcus faecalis also had 
a high sensitivity and specificity for predicting IE in HACEK bacteremia. The
30-day mortality was 4% in IE and 15% in non-IE bacteremia, and only one case of 
relapse was found. IE is common in bacteremia with Aggregatibacter,
Cardiobacterium, and Kingella but relatively rare in Haemophilus and Eikenella.
Treatment failures are very rare, and DENOVA can be used to evaluate the need for
transesophageal echocardiography.
