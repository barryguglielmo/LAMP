A 76-year-old woman with a rare case of spinal epidural abscess (SEA) that had no
risk factors for such type of infection, presented symptoms of back pain,
progressive neurological deficit of the lower limb and loss of sphincter control.
A gadolinium-enhanced MRI confirmed the diagnosis of an SEA. The patient
underwent laminectomy with surgical drainage, where cultures showed the presence 
of Aggregatibacter aphrophilus, a bacterium of the HACEK group (Haemophilus
species, Aggregatibacter species, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens,
and Kingella species), rarely involved in SEA. Following surgery, the patient was
treated with intravenous ceftriaxone for 6 weeks, and this gave excellent
results.
