Microbial biosurfactants has evolved as green molecules and their chemical
diversity has gained momentum in recent time not only in the field of
environmental and industrial sectors but also in the pharmaceutical sector. In
this study, an effort was made for the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticle
(AgNPs) having antimicrobial and non-cytotoxic activities with the help of
microbial biosurfactant extracted from a novel Bacillus vallismortis strain MDU6 
(Genbank accession no. MH382951) from petroleum oil logged soil sample in
Dibrugarh, Assam. The isolate shows excellent potential for the production of
biosurfactant by reducing the surface tension of diesel supplemented medium up to
56.57% only within 5 days. FTIR spectra of the crude biosurfactant show the
presence of ʋCH2 (asymmetric stretching), ʋCH2 (symmetric stretching), ʋC=C
(stretch), ʋC-C (stretch), ʋC-H (bending), ʋC-O (stretch) and ʋC-H (bending)
functional groups and LC-MS/MS analysis confirms it as a cyclic lipopeptide which
is a mixture of surfactin and iturin. The synthesized AgNPs showed excellent
antimicrobial activities against Escherichia coli (ATCC no. 25922), Listeria
monocytogenes (ATCC No. BAA-751), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC No. 9542) and
Bacillus subtilis (ATCC no. 6051) and showed no cytotoxicity against primary
mouse liver cell lines.
