Luteoloside (luteolin-7-O-glucoside), the biomarker of Lonicera japonica, was
efficiently bio-synthetized from its cheaper precursor luteolin. The structure of
luteoloside was characterized by LC-MS and NMR analyses. Compared to the
significant inhibitory effect of luteolin on human hepatocyte cell line LO2 at
high doses, luteoloside did not show obvious cytotoxic effects at any test dose. 
Moreover, luteoloside exhibited obvious promotive effects on human hepatocyte
cells, suggesting a potential application in hepatoprotective therapies.
