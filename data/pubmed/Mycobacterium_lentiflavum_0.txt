The incidence of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections is increasing worldwide;
by 2017, more than 190 species and subspecies have been documented. Although
classically associated with immunosuppression, the recognition of these
etiological agents in diseases affecting immunocompetent individuals and in
healthcare-associated infections, such as after surgical and cosmetic procedures,
makes the study of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of these microorganisms
relevant in medical practice. Mycobacterium lentiflavum is slow-growing and
rarely affects the skin. A case of cutaneous mycobacteriosis caused by M.
lentiflavum is reported in an immunocompetent patient after subcutaneous
injection of a lipolytic compound, treated with clarithromycin and levofloxacin.
