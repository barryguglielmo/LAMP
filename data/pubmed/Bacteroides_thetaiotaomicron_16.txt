A variety of cell surface structures dictate interactions between bacteria and
their environment, including their viruses (bacteriophages). Members of the human
gut Bacteroidetes characteristically produce several phase-variable capsular
polysaccharides (CPSs), but their contributions to bacteriophage interactions are
unknown. To begin to understand how CPSs have an impact on Bacteroides-phage
interactions, we isolated 71 Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron-infecting
bacteriophages from two locations in the United States. Using B. thetaiotaomicron
strains that express defined subsets of CPSs, we show that CPSs dictate host
tropism for these phages and that expression of non-permissive CPS variants is
selected under phage predation, enabling survival. In the absence of CPSs, B.
thetaiotaomicron escapes bacteriophage predation by altering expression of eight 
distinct phase-variable lipoproteins. When constitutively expressed, one of these
lipoproteins promotes resistance to multiple bacteriophages. Our results reveal
important roles for Bacteroides CPSs and other cell surface structures that allow
these bacteria to persist under bacteriophage predation, and hold important
implications for using bacteriophages therapeutically to target gut symbionts.
