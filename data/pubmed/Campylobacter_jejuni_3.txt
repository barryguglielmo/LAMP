Paper-based sensors can be exploited to develop low-cost, disposable, and rapid
assays for the detection of a large variety of analytes. We report a paper-based 
sensor system for a point-of-care (POC) nucleic acid amplification test that can 
quantitatively detect multiple genes from different pathogens. The POC system
combines a paper sensor chip and a portable instrument, which is built on an
Internet of Things (IoT) platform. The paper-based sensor provides the functions 
of reagent storage, sample transportation, and nucleic acid amplification. The
IoT instrument uses an Arduino microcontroller to control temperature, collect
fluorescence images, and store the data in cloud storage via a WiFi network. A
compact fluorescence reader was designed to measure fluorescence images of the
amplicons during a loop-mediated isothermal amplification reaction in real-time. 
The real-time detection capability enables the quantitative analysis of target
genes. The results show that the paper-based sensor cam distinguish multiple
genes of the genomic DNA extracted from Escherichia coli and Campylobacter
jejuni, with the concentration as low as 2 × 103 copies/μL. The affordable
instrument, in conjunction with the disposable paper sensor chip, would have a
great potential for POC detections of pathogens.
