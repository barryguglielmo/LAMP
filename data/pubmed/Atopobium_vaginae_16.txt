OBJECTIVE: To compare the vaginal microbiota of women living with HIV (WLWH) with
the vaginal microbiota of women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis (BV) and
healthy women without HIV to determine if there are differences in the vaginal
microbiome, what factors influence these differences, and to characterise HIV
clinical parameters including viral load and CD4 count in relation to the vaginal
microbiome.
DESIGN: Observational cohort study.
SETTING: Canada.
POPULATION: Women aged 18-49 years who were premenopausal and not pregnant were
recruited into three cohorts: healthy women, WLWH and women with recurrent BV.
METHODS: Demographic and clinical data were collected via interviews and medical 
chart reviews. Vaginal swabs were collected for Gram-stain assessment and
microbiome profiling using the cpn60 barcode sequence.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: To compare overall community composition differences, we
used compositional data analysis methods, hierarchical clustering and
Kruskal-Wallis tests where appropriate.
RESULTS: Clinical markers such as odour and abnormal discharge, but not
irritation, were associated with higher microbial diversity. WLWH with
unsuppressed HIV viral loads were more likely than other groups to have
non-Gardnerella-dominated microbiomes. HIV was associated with higher vaginal
microbial diversity and this was related to HIV viral load, with unsuppressed
women demonstrating significantly higher relative abundance of Megasphaera
genomosp. 1, Atopobium vaginae and Clostridiales sp. (all P < 0.05) compared with
all other groups.
CONCLUSIONS: In WLWH, unsuppressed HIV viral loads were associated with a
distinct dysbiotic profile consisting of very low levels of Lactobacillus and
high levels of anaerobes.
TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Vaginal microbiomes in WLWH with viral load >50 copies/ml
have distinct dysbiotic profiles with high levels of anaerobes.
