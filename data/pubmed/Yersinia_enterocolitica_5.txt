Immune evasion through membrane remodeling is a hallmark of Yersinia pestis
pathogenesis. Yersinia remodels its membrane during its life cycle as it
alternates between mammalian hosts (37 °C) and ambient (21 °C to 26 °C)
temperatures of the arthropod transmission vector or external environment. This
shift in growth temperature induces changes in number and length of acyl groups
on the lipid A portion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for the enteric pathogens
Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (Ypt) and Yersinia enterocolitica (Ye), as well as
the causative agent of plague, Yersinia pestis (Yp). Addition of a C16 fatty acid
(palmitate) to lipid A by the outer membrane acyltransferase enzyme PagP occurs
in immunostimulatory Ypt and Ye strains, but not in immune-evasive Yp Analysis of
Yp pagP gene sequences identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism that results
in a premature stop in translation, yielding a truncated, nonfunctional enzyme.
Upon repair of this polymorphism to the sequence present in Ypt and Ye, lipid A
isolated from a Yp pagP+ strain synthesized two structures with the C16 fatty
acids located in acyloxyacyl linkage at the 2' and 3' positions of the
diglucosamine backbone. Structural modifications were confirmed by mass
spectrometry and gas chromatography. With the genotypic restoration of PagP
enzymatic activity in Yp, a significant increase in lipid A endotoxicity mediated
through the MyD88 and TRIF/TRAM arms of the TLR4-signaling pathway was observed. 
Discovery and repair of an evolutionarily lost lipid A modifying enzyme provides 
evidence of lipid A as a crucial determinant in Yp infectivity, pathogenesis, and
host innate immune evasion.
