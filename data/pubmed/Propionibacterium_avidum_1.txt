A 10-year retrospective study of Propionibacterium/Cutibacterium-positive samples
gathered from hospitalized patients was conducted at Nantes University hospital. 
A total of 2728 Propionibacterium/Cutibacterium-positive samples analyzed between
2007 and 2016 were included. Due to the implementation of MALDI-TOF
identification in 2013, most non-Cutibacterium acnes isolates were identified a
second time using this technology. Over that period, Cutibacterium acnes remained
the most predominant species accounting for 91.5% (2497/2728) of the isolates,
followed by Cutibacterium avidum (4.2%, 115/2728) and Cutibacterium granulosum
(2.4%, 64/2728). Regarding the origin of samples, the orthopaedic department was 
the main Cutibacterium sample provider representing 51.9% (1415/2728) of all
samples followed by the dermatology department (11.5%, 315/2728). Samples were
recovered from various tissue locations: 31.5% (858/2728) from surgery-related
samples such as shoulder, spine or hip replacement devices and 19.1% (520/2728)
from skin samples. MALDI-TOF method revealed misidentification before 2013.
Cutibacterium avidum was falsely identified as C. granulosum (n = 33).
Consequently, MALDI-TOF technology using up-to-date databases should be preferred
to biochemical identification in order to avoid biased species identification.
Regarding antibiotic resistance, 14.7% (20/136) of C. acnes was resistant to
erythromycin. 4.1% (41/1005) of C. acnes strains, 17.9% (12/67) of C. avidum
strains and 3.6% (1/28) of C. granulosum strains were found resistant to
clindamycin.
