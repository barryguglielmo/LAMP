BACKGROUND: Neointimal hyperplasia is a major contributor to restenosis after
arterial interventions, but the genetic and environmental mechanisms underlying
the variable propensity for neointimal hyperplasia between individuals, including
the role of commensal microbiota, are not well understood. We sought to
characterize how shifting the microbiome using cage sharing and bedding mixing
between rats with differing restenosis phenotypes after carotid artery balloon
angioplasty could alter arterial remodeling.
METHODS: We co-housed and mixed bedding between genetically distinct rats (Lewis 
[LE] and Sprague-Dawley [SD]) that harbor different commensal microbes and that
are known to have different neointimal hyperplasia responses to carotid artery
balloon angioplasty. Sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene was used to monitor
changes in the gut microbiome.
RESULTS: There were significant differences in neointimal hyperplasia between
non-co-housed LE and SD rats 14 days after carotid artery angioplasty (mean
intima + media [I + M] area, 0.117 ± 0.014 mm2 LE vs 0.275 ± 0.021 mm2 SD; P <
.001) that were diminished by co-housing. Co-housing also altered local
adventitial Ki67 immunoreactivity, local accumulation of leukocytes and
macrophages (total and M2), and interleukin 17A concentration 3 days after
surgery in each strain. Non-co-housed SD and LE rats had microbiomes
distinguished by both weighted (P = .012) and unweighted (P < .001) UniFrac beta 
diversity distances, although without significant differences in alpha diversity.
The difference in unweighted beta diversity between the fecal microbiota of SD
and LE rats was significantly reduced by co-housing. Operational taxonomic units 
that significantly correlated with average I + M area include Parabacteroides
distasonis, Desulfovibrio, Methanosphaera, Peptococcus, and Prevotella. Finally, 
serum concentrations of microbe-derived metabolites hydroxyanthranilic acid and
kynurenine/tryptophan ratio were significantly associated with I + M area in both
rat strains independent of co-housing.
CONCLUSIONS: We describe a novel mechanism for how microbiome manipulations
affect arterial remodeling and the inflammatory response after arterial injury. A
greater understanding of the host inflammatory-microbe axis could uncover novel
therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of restenosis.
