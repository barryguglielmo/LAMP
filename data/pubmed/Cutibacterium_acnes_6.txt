Cutibacterium acnes is an opportunistic pathogen involved in Bone and Prosthesis 
Infections (BPIs). In this study, we observed the behavior of commensal and BPI
C. acnes strains in the bone environment through bacterial internalization by
osteoblast-like cells and biofilm formation. For the commensal strains, less than
1% of the bacteria were internalized; among them, about 32.7 ± 3.9% persisted
intracellularly for up to 48 h. C. acnes infection seems to have no cytotoxic
effect on bone cells as detected by LDH assay. Interestingly, commensal C. acnes 
showed a significant increase in biofilm formation after osteoblast-like
internalization for 50% of the strains (2.8-fold increase). This phenomenon is
exacerbated on a titanium support, a material used for medical devices. For the
BPI clinical strains, we did not notice any increase in biofilm formation after
internalization despite a similar internalization rate by the osteoblast-like
cells. Furthermore, fluorescent staining revealed more live bacteria within the
biofilm after osteoblast-like cell interaction, for all strains (BPIs and
commensal). The genomic study did not reveal any link between their clinical
origin and phylotype. In conclusion, we have shown for the first time the
possible influence of internalization by osteoblast-like cells on commensal C.
