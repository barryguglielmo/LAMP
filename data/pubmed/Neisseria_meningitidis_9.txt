INTRODUCTION: Prior to implementation of Haemophilus influenzae type b
(Hib)-conjugate vaccination programs in the 1990s, Hib was the commonest cause of
bacterial meningitis in children aged <5 years. While the burden of all Hib
disease has significantly decreased in the post vaccination era, Hib still
accounted for >29,000 deaths worldwide in children aged <5 years in 2015.
AREAS COVERED: We reviewed literature data on the most widely used Hib vaccines
and vaccination strategies which led to the global prevention and control of Hib 
disease and aim to highlight important factors for continued disease control and 
elimination in the future.
EXPERT COMMENTARY: More than 90% of countries worldwide have implemented
Hib-conjugate vaccination in their national immunization programs. Vaccines
containing Hib polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP) conjugated with tetanus toxoid 
(Hib-TT) are the most commonly used. Neisseria meningitidis outer membrane
protein complex of PRP (Hib-OMP) is also used. Although the kinetics of the
immune response varies with Hib vaccine and schedule used, high control of Hib
disease was observed in all settings/scenarios. Further improving global Hib
vaccination coverage may result in disease elimination.
