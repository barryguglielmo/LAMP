Serlyticin-A is a secondary metabolite first isolated from a culture of Serratia 
ureilytica grown using squid pen as the sole carbon/nitrogen source. A previous
study by Kuo et al. demonstrated that it has antioxidative and antiproliferative 
properties. However, the proposed chemical structure of serlyticin-A is likely
incorrect based on the thermodynamic instability of its three contiguous
heteroatom-heteroatom bonds. Here, we use quantum chemical calculations to
predict 1H and 13C chemical shifts for serlyticin-A and demonstrate a discrepancy
between the calculated and experimental chemical shifts. We then propose several 
reasonable alternative structures for serlyticin-A. Considering the known
antioxidant and antiproliferative activity of hydroxamic acids as well as their
stability and prevalence in natural products of bacterial origin, we believe that
serlyticin-A is most likely 3-indolylacetohydroxamic acid (4). We provide our
rationale for this assignment as well as experimental data for pure
3-indolylacetohydroxamic acid obtained via de novo synthesis. This study
highlights the power of computational NMR shift prediction to revise chemical
structures for natural products like serlyticin-A.
