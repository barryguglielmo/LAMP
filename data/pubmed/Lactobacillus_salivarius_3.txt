The present study aimed to assess the palatability of sausages undergoing
low-temperature fermentation and drying process. Lactobacillus sakei D-1001 or
Lactobacillus salivarius A001 were used as starter cultures for fermentation, and
the following properties of the sausages were investigated: colony-forming units 
of lactic acid bacteria; concentrations of lactic acid, protein, peptides, and
free amino acids; distribution of protein; composition of free amino acids; and
physical properties and taste. Alterations in the composition of proteins,
peptides, and free amino acids as well as in various physical properties were
caused by fermentation by lactic acid bacteria. A sensory test indicated that the
palatability of the fermented sausages was greater than that of the non-fermented
sausages, particularly in terms of hardness and juiciness. This was considered to
be due to protein degeneration and changes in the physical properties of the
sausages as a result of fermentation by lactic acid bacteria. However, the taste 
of the fermented sausages was sourer than that of the non-fermented sausages, and
therefore, inferior. Our study revealed that the palatability of the sausages in 
terms of hardness and juiciness were increased by low-temperature fermentation by
lactic acid bacteria and the drying process.
