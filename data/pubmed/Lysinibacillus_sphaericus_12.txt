A Gram-staining positive, motile, rod-shaped and subterminal endospore-forming
bacterium, designated strain SYSU K30005T, was isolated from a soil sample
collected from a karst cave in Libo county, Guizhou province, south-western
China. Strain SYSU K30005T showed the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity
with Lysinibacillus fusiformis (98.6%) and Lysinibacillus sphaericus (98.2%). In 
phylogenetic tree, strain SYSU K30005T clade with the members of the genus
Lysinibacillus. Based on the phylogenetic and 16S gene sequence result, strain
SYSU K30005T was affiliated to the genus Lysinibacillus. The growth of SYSU
K30005T was observed at 15-37 °C (optimum, 28 °C), pH 6.0-9.0 (optimum, pH 7.0)
and in the presence of 0-4% (w/v) NaCl (optimum in 3.5% NaCl). Cell wall
peptidoglycan type was A4α (Lys-Asp). The cell-wall sugars of SYSU K30005T were
ribose, galactose and mannose and MK-7 was the only quinone. The fatty acids
(> 5% of total fatty acids) were iso-C15:0, anteiso-C15:0, iso-C16:0 and
iso-C17:0. The polar lipids profile included diphosphatidylglycerol,
phosphatideylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and an unidentified phospholipid.
The genomic DNA G + C content was 37.2 mol%. The average nucleotide identity
values between SYSU K30005T and its closest relatives were below the cut-off
level (95-96%) for species delineation. The results support the conclusion that
strain SYSU K30005T represents a novel species of the genus Lysinibacillus, for
which we proposed the name Lysinibacillus cavernae sp. nov. The type strain is
SYSU K30005T (= KCTC 43130T = CGMCC 1.17492T).
