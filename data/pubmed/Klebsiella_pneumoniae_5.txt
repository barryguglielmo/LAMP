INTRODUCTION: The emergence and spread of carbapenemase-producing
Enterobacterales (CPE) is a worldwide public health threat. Rapid and accurate
detection of CPE is essential to prevent their dissemination within health care
settings. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of CIM, mCIM and 
mCIM with ammonium bicarbonate (mCIM-A) methods by using different interpretation
criteria for detection of carbapenemases.
METHODS: One hundred and fifty-three Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates previously
characterized by molecular tests, including 133 carbapenemase producers and 20
non-carbapenemase producers, were collected in this study. CIM and mCIM tests
were performed as described previously. mCIM-A by adding 50 mM ammonium
bicarbonate to the bacterial suspension prepared in tryptic soy broth. The
inhibition zone diameter of around meropenem disc was measured and interpreted as
positive according to i) Pierce and colleagues (<19 mm), ii) EUCAST meropenem
susceptibility breakpoint (<22).
RESULTS: CIM, although seems to be good for carbapenemases other than OXA-48-like
and NDM, is not satisfactory (42.3% and 83.4%, respectively) for those enzymes
with any of the interpretation criteria. OXA-48-like and NDM were detected with a
better performance (88.7% and 92.8, respectively) with mCIM when results were
interpreted according to <22 mm zone diameter for OXA-48-like and NDM. The best
results were obtained with mCIM-A using <22 mm criteria without any difference in
the results of other enzymes and negative strains.
CONCLUSIONS: mCIM-A method interpreted with <22 mm meropenem zone diameter seems 
to be preferable compared to CIM and mCIM. mCIM-A is simple and useful tool for
identification of CPEs in clinical microbiology laboratories.
