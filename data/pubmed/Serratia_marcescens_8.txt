Serratia marcescens are gram-negative bacteria found in several environmental
niches, including the plant rhizosphere and patients in hospitals. Here, we
present the genome of Serratia marcescens strain N4-5 (=NRRL B-65519), which has 
a size of 5,074,473 bp (664-fold coverage) and contains 4840 protein coding
genes, 21 RNA genes, and an average G + C content of 59.7%. N4-5 harbours a
plasmid of 11,089 bp and 43.5% G + C content that encodes six unique CDS repeated
2.5× times totalling 13 CDS. Our genome assembly and manual curation uncovered
the insertion of two extra copies of the 5S rRNA gene in the assembled sequence, 
which was confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing to be a misassembly. This
artefact was subsequently removed from the final assembly. The occurrence of
extra copies of the 5S rRNA gene was also observed in most complete genomes of
Serratia spp. deposited in public databases in our comparative analysis. These
elements, which also occur naturally, can easily be confused with true genetic
variation. Efforts to discover and correct assembly artefacts should be made in
order to generate genome sequences that represent the biological truth underlying
the studied organism. We present the genome of N4-5 and discuss genes potentially
involved in biological control activity against plant pathogens and also the
possible mechanisms responsible for the artefact we observed in our initial
assembly. This report raises awareness about the extra copies of the 5S rRNA gene
in sequenced bacterial genomes as they may represent misassemblies and therefore 
should be verified experimentally.
