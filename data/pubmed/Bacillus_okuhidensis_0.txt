The present study was carried out to clarify the taxonomic relationship between
two closely related Bacillus species, Bacillus okuhidensis Li et al. 2002 and
Bacillus halodurans (ex Boyer 1973) Nielsen et al. 1995. The maximum-likelihood
tree based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence and the phylogenomic tree based on
concatenation of 16 protein-marker genes showed that these species were similar. 
Average nucleotide identity (ANIm 99.25 %, ANIb 98.2 %) and digital DNA-DNA
hybridization values (93.5 %) between B. okuhidensis DSM 13666T and B. halodurans
DSM 497T were greater than the threshold values for bacterial species
delineation, indicating that they belong to the same species. Therefore, B.
okuhidensis Li et al. 2002 should be reclassified as a later heterotypic synonym 
of B. halodurans (ex Boyer 1973) Nielsen et al. 1995.
