BACKGROUND: Mother-to-newborn transmission of obesity-associated microbiota may
be modified by birth mode (vaginal vs. Cesarean delivery). Prospective data to
test this hypothesis are still sparse.
OBJECTIVE: To examine prospective associations of maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and 
gestational weight gain with the infant gut microbiome by birth-mode strata.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: In 335 mother-infant pairs in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort,
we ascertained data from questionnaires and medical records, and generated
microbiome data from 6-week-old infants' stool using Illumina 16s rRNA gene
sequencing (V4-V5 region). Analyses were stratified by birth mode and conducted
before and after adjusting for potential confounders, which included maternal
age, education, parity, and Mediterranean diet score.
RESULTS: Among 335 mothers, 56% had normal pre-pregnancy BMI ( < 25, referent),
27% were overweight (BMI 25-30), and 18% obese (BMI > 30). Among the 312 mothers 
with weight gain data, 10% had inadequate weight gain, 30% adequate (referent),
and 60% excess. Birth mode modified associations of pre-pregnancy BMI with
several genera, including the most abundant genus, Bacteroides (P for
interaction = 0.05). In the vaginal-delivery group, maternal overweight or
obesity was associated with higher infant gut microbiome diversity and higher
relative abundance of 15 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), including
overrepresentation of Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Veillonella dispar,
and OTUs in the genera Staphylococcus and Enterococcus. In the Cesarean-delivered
group, there were no significant associations of pre-pregnancy BMI with infant
microbiome (alpha) diversity or OTUs. Gestational weight gain was not associated 
with differential relative abundance of infant gut microbial OTUs or with
measures of microbial diversity in infants delivered vaginally or by Cesarean
section.
CONCLUSIONS: Among vaginally-delivered infants, maternal overweight and obesity
was associated with altered infant gut microbiome composition and higher
diversity. These associations were not observed in Cesarean-delivered infants,
whose microbiome development differs from vaginally-delivered infants. Our study 
provides additional evidence of birth-mode dependent associations of maternal
body weight status with the infant gut microbiota. The role of these associations
in mediating the intergenerational cycle of obesity warrants further examination.
