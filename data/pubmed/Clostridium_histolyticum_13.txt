OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of collagenase Clostridium
histolyticum (CCH) for the management of penile deformities in patients
presenting with different categories of atypical Peyronie's disease (PD).
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of charts of patients who presented 
to a men's health clinic with atypical PD between October 2016 and June 2019. We 
included patients in the stable phase of the disease, had completed a penile
duplex Doppler ultrasound before any intervention, and proceeded with CCH
treatment. Gathered data included patient demographics, treatment details,
outcomes, and complications. Outcomes collected were both quantitative (curvature
assessments) and qualitative using the symptom bother domain (last 6 questions;
Q10 to Q15) of the Peyronie's Disease Questionnaire.
RESULTS: Twenty-one men with stable PD underwent CCH inject therapy after penile 
duplex Doppler ultrasound. The mean number of injections was 8.4 (standard
deviation [SD] = 3.3), and the mean follow-up was 20.5 months (SD = 5.9). The
overall mean change in penile curvature was -19.2° ± 8.3°, which corresponded to 
a -39% ± 13% improvement in curvature (P = .0079). In men who presented with an
indentation or hourglass deformity, 11 of 17 (64%) were satisfied and reported
subjective improvement in narrowing/indentation after receiving CCH injections.
The average composite symptom bother domain of the Peyronie's Disease
Questionnaire decreased by 6.7 (P = .0029).
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that CCH appears to be safe and provide
significant clinical improvements in men presenting with atypical PD.
