We report on the findings of the first antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance 
study in Japan of isolates recovered from odontogenic infections. Of the 38
facilities where patients representing the 4 groups of odontogenic infections
were seen, 102 samples were collected from cases of periodontitis (group 1), 6
samples from pericoronitis (group 2), 84 samples from jaw inflammation (group 3) 
and 54 samples from phlegmon of the jaw bone area (group 4) for a total of 246
samples. The positivity rates of bacterial growth on culture were 85.3%, 100%,
84% and 88.9%, respectively, for groups 1, 2, 3 and 4. Streptococcus spp.
isolation rates according to odontogenic infection group were 22% (group 1),
17.7% (group 3) and 20.7% (group 4). Anaerobic isolation rates were 66.9% (group 
1), 71.8% (group 3) and 68.2% (group 4). Drug susceptibility tests were performed
on 726 strains excluding 121 strains that were undergrown. The breakdown of the
strains subjected to testing was 186 Streptococcus spp., 179 anaerobic
gram-positive cocci, 246 Prevotella spp., 27 Porphyromonas spp., and 88
Fusobacterium spp. The isolates were tested against 30 antimicrobial agents.
Sensitivities to penicillins and cephems were good except for Prevotella spp. The
low sensitivities of Prevotella spp is due to β-lactamase production. Prevotella 
strains resistant to macrolides, quinolones, and clindamycin were found. No
strains resistant to carbapenems or penems were found among all strains tested.
No anaerobic bacterial strain was resistant to metronidazole. Antimicrobial
susceptibility testing performed on the S. anginosus group and anaerobic
bacteria, which are the major pathogens associated with odontogenic infections,
showed low MIC90 values to the penicillins which are the first-line antimicrobial
agents for odontogenic infections; however, for Prevotella spp., penicillins
combined with β-lactamase inhibitor showed low MIC90 values.
