BACKGROUND: A pyogenic liver abscess (PLA) represents a pus-filled cavity within 
the liver parenchyma caused by the invasion and multiplication of bacteria. The
most common offender isolated from the PLA in children is Staphylococcus aureus. 
Abiotrophia defectiva is a Gram-positive pleomorphic bacterium, commonly found in
the oral cavity, intestinal, and genitourinary mucosa as part of the normal
microbiota. It has been proven to be an etiological factor in various infections,
but rarely in cases of PLA. The case presented here is, to the best of our
knowledge, the first pediatric case of PLA caused by A. defectiva.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 13-year-old Caucasian boy presented with a two-day history
of abdominal pain, fever up to 40 °C, and polyuria. Contrast-enhanced computed
tomography (CT) scan revealed a single, multiloculated liver lesion, suggestive
of a liver abscess. The boy had sustained a bicycle handlebar injury to his upper
abdomen 3 weeks before the symptoms appeared and had been completely asymptomatic
until 2 days before admission. He was successfully treated with antibiotic
therapy and open surgical drainage. A. defectiva was isolated from the abscess
material. Histopathology report described the lesion as a chronic PLA.
CONCLUSIONS: A. defectiva is a highly uncommon cause of liver abscess in
children. In such cases, various predisposing factors should be considered,
including antecedent blunt abdominal trauma.
