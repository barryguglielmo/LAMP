D-Galactose-specific L-arabinose isomerase (L-AI) would have much potential for
the enzymatic conversion of D-Galactose into D-tagatose, while most of the
reported L-AIs are L-arabinose specific. This study explored a highly
D-Galactose-specific L-AI from Bifidobacterium adolescentis (BAAI) for the
production of D-tagatose. In the comparative protein-substrate docking for
D-Galactose and L-arabinose, BAAI showed higher numbers of hydrogen bonds in
D-Galactose-BAAI bonding site than those found in L-arabinose-BAAI bonding site. 
The activity of BAAI was 24.47 U/mg, and it showed good stability at temperatures
up to 65°C and a pH range 6.0-7.5. The K m, V max, and K cat/K m of BAAI were
found to be 22.4 mM, 489 U/mg and 9.3 mM-1 min-1, respectively for D-Galactose,
while the respective values for L-arabinose were 40.2 mM, 275.1 U/mg, and 8.6
mM-1 min-1. Enzymatic conversion of D-Galactose into D-tagatose by BAAI showed
56.7% conversion efficiency at 55°C and pH 6.5 after 10 h.
