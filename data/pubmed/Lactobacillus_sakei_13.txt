AIMS: To utilize transgenic GMR-Aβ42 Drosophila melanogaster as a model to
evaluate potential Alzheimer's disease (AD)-reversal effects via the
administration of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains, and associations of LAB
with changes in gut microbiota profiles.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Wild type flies (Oregon-R) was crossed with glass multimer
reporter-GAL4 (GMR-GAL4) to produce GMR-OreR (Control), while UAS-Aβ42 (#33769)
crossed with GMR-GAL4 to produce transgenic Drosophila line that expressed Aβ42
(GMR-Aβ42). Feed containing seven different LAB strains (Lactobacillus paracasei 
0291, Lactobacillus helveticus 1515, Lactobacillus reuteri CDV, Lactobacillus
reuteri 8513d, Lactobacillus fermentum 8312, Lactobacillus casei Y, Lactobacillus
sakei Probio65) were given to GMR-Aβ42 respectively, while feed without LAB
strains were given to control and transgenic GMR-Aβ42.nf Drosophila lines. The
morphology of the eyes was viewed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The
changes in gut microbiota profiles associated with LAB were analyzed using 16s
high throughput sequencing. Malformation of eye structures in transgenic GMR-Aβ42
Drosophila were reversed upon the administration of LAB strains, with more
prevalent effects from Lactobacillus sakei Probio65 and Lactobacillus paracasei
0291. The GMR-Aβ42.nf group showed dominance of Wolbachia in the gut, a genus
that was almost absent in the normal control group (P<0.05). The administration
of L. sakei Probio65 and L. paracasei 0291 reduced the abundance of Wolbachia
accompanied by increased abundance of Stenotrophomonas and Acetobacter (P<0.05), 
resembling the microbial profile of the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: L. sakei Probio65 and L. paracasei 0291 have more prominent effects 
in reversing malformed eye of transgenic GMR-Aβ42 Drosophila, and reducing the
abundance of Wolbachia accompanied by an increased abundance of Stenotrophomonas 
and Acetobacter.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Potentials of LAB to prevent and/or
alleviate the onset and pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD,
supporting brain health strategies along the gut-brain axis.
