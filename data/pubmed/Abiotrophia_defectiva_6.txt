Abiotrophia defectiva is a rare pathogen of infective endocarditis (IE) but is
frequently involved in embolic complication and valvular dysfunction. IE caused
by A. defectiva in children is poorly studied. This study reports four cases of
A. defectiva IE in children and reviews previously reported five pediatric cases 
of A. defectiva IE. Most of the patients presented with a subacute course, with
prolonged fever or atypical symptoms. Eight patients had embolic complications at
presentation. All nine children were treated with combination antimicrobial
therapy and six of them received surgical intervention. All patients recovered
well without relapse. A. defectiva should be considered in children with
infective endocarditis, especially in those with atypical presentations. As
complications are frequent and more than half of the patients need surgical
treatment, prompt diagnosis along with appropriate treatment is necessary.
