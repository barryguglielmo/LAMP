In recent years, studies have focused on the therapeutic properties of probiotics
to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms associated with various diseases.
Lactobacilli are important probiotics groups that have been found to possess many
health-promoting activities. This study was carried out to isolate
LactobacillusreuteriLR12 and L. lactisLL10 from pineapple puree. The invitro
analysis to evaluate probiotic characteristics of the isolated bacteria included 
survival in bile and acid tolerance. The cell-free supernatant of L. reuteri LR12
was effective against various pathogenic bacteria and fungi compared with L.
lactisLL10. These two bacterial strains have strong anti-biofilm activity (100%) 
against Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus. The
bacterial strains exhibited adhesion properties to HT-29 cells (human colorectal 
adenocarcinoma). These bacteria showed DPPH-
(2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate) free radical scavenging activity,
scavenging of hydroxyl radical activity, superoxide radical scavenging activity, 
and reducing power activity in the range of 72% ± 3%to 89.3% ± 1.7%, 64% ± 2.7%to
66.8% ± 1.5%, 59.8% ± 4.1% to 63.8% ± 2.1%, and 60.4% ± 1.8%to 66.1% ± 3.3%,
respectively. Pineapple puree was used as the starter culture with milk for 2
days for yogurt preparation. Pineapple puree increased flavor and showed the
physicochemical properties of yogurt. The finding of the sensory evaluation
revealed no significant change compared with the control, except the appearance
of yogurt. These findings show that Lactobacilli and pineapple puree have
potential use in various probiotic preparations for the fermentation industry.
