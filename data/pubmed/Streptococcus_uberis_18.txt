Mastitis caused by Streptococcus uberis (S. uberis) is a common and
difficult-to-cure clinical disease in dairy cows. In this study, the role of
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and TLR-mediated signaling pathways in mastitis caused
by S. uberis was investigated using mouse models and mammary epithelial cells
(MECs). We used S. uberis to infect mammary glands of wild type, TLR2-/- and
TLR4-/- mice and quantified the adaptor molecules in TLR signaling pathways,
proinflammatory cytokines, tissue damage, and bacterial count. When compared with
TLR4 deficiency, TLR2 deficiency induced more severe pathological changes through
myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)-mediated signaling pathways
during S. uberis infection. In MECs, TLR2 detected S. uberis infection and
induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) to assist host in
controlling the secretion of inflammatory factors and the elimination of
intracellular S. uberis. Our results demonstrated that TLR2-mediated mROS has a
significant effect on S. uberis-induced host defense responses in mammary glands 
as well as in MECs.
