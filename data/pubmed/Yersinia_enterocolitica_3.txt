Conventional methods for Yersinia enterocolitica detection in food samples are
generally considered inadequate. Problems arise from the presence of the
so-called "background flora", coupled to the low contamination level of the
pathogen. Since, data on the microbial ecology occurring in competitive
microflora are still lacking, MALDI TOF MS was used for strains 'identification
after enrichment in PSB or ITC broths, and after plating on selective CIN medium 
at different incubation times. SYBR Green Real time PCR was used for the Y.
enterocolitica strains' detection (4/O:3, 1A/O:5) in experimentally contaminated 
foods, as well as in naturally contaminated samples. A higher number of different
bacterial genera (10 on CIN and 18 on PCA) was recorded after enrichment in PSB, 
whilst enrichment in ITC led to recovery of 6 and 10 genera on CIN and PCA,
respectively. Yersiniaceae was the dominant family on the first day of
incubation, but on the second day the percentage of isolation considerably
decreased. By testing experimentally contaminated samples, substantial
difficulties were encountered. The biotype 1A was always detected, whereas strain
4/O:3 proved to be poorly competitive. Based on the data, the enrichment media
PSB and ITC, currently proposed for Y. enterocolitica detection, need to be
improved to promote a successful pathogen's recovery.
