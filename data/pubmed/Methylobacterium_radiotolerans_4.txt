Methylobacterium radiotolerans has only been identified in blood samples from
end-stage renal failure or leukaemia patients in clinic. Here, we report a case
of infective endocarditis (IE) caused by M. radiotolerans. 16S rRNA sequencing
and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry 
(MALDI-TOF MS) were used to identify the bacteria isolated from cardiac
vegetation. A drug sensitivity test was conducted by disk diffusion on blood
Mueller-Hinton agar. This isolate was identified as M. radiotolerans, which was
susceptible to aminoglycosides and ciprofloxacin. Our findings also suggest that 
M. radiotolerans can cause infection in a patient with normal immune function.
