Sucrose utilization has been established in Escherichia coli strains by
expression of Mannheimia succiniciproducens β-fructofuranosidase (SacC), which
hydrolyzes sucrose into glucose and fructose. Recombinant E. coli strains that
can utilize sucrose were examined for their abilities to produce
poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) [P(3HB)] and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-lactate)
[P(3HB-co-LA)] from sucrose. When recombinant E. coli strains expressing
Ralstonia eutropha PhaCAB and SacC were cultured in MR medium containing 20 g/L
of sucrose, all recombinant E. coli strains could produce P(3HB) from sucrose.
Also, recombinant E. coli strains expressing Pseudomonas sp. MBEL 6-19 PhaC1437, 
Clostridium propionicum Pct540, R. eutropha PhaAB enzymes along with SacC could
produce P(3HB-co-LA) from sucrose. Among the examined E. coli strains,
recombinant E. coli XL1-Blue produced the highest contents of P(3HB)
(53.60 ± 2.55 wt%) and P(3HB-co-LA) (29.44 ± 0.39 wt%). In the batch
fermentations, recombinant E. coli XL1-Blue strains completely consumed 20 g/L of
sucrose as the sole carbon source and supported the production of 3.76 g/L of
P(3HB) and 1.82 g/L of P(3HB-co-LA) with 38.21 wt% P(3HB) and 20.88 wt%
P(3HB-co-LA) contents, respectively. Recombinant E. coli strains developed in
this study can be used to establish a cost-efficient biorefinery for the
production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) from sucrose, which is an abundant and
inexpensive carbon source.
