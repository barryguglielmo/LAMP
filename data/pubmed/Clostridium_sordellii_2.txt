The exotoxin TcsL is a major virulence factor in Paeniclostridium (Clostridium)
sordellii and responsible for the high lethality rate associated with
P. sordellii infection. Here, we present a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-mediated
screen using a human lung carcinoma cell line and identify semaphorin (SEMA) 6A
and 6B as receptors for TcsL. Disrupting SEMA6A/6B expression in several distinct
human cell lines and primary human endothelial cells results in reduced TcsL
sensitivity, while SEMA6A/6B over-expression increases their sensitivity. TcsL
recognizes the extracellular domain (ECD) of SEMA6A/6B via a region homologous to
the receptor-binding site in Clostridioides difficile toxin B (TcdB), which binds
the human receptor Frizzled. Exchanging the receptor-binding interfaces between
TcsL and TcdB switches their receptor-binding specificity. Finally,
administration of SEMA6A-ECD proteins protects human cells from TcsL toxicity and
reduces TcsL-induced damage to lung tissues and the lethality rate in mice. These
findings establish SEMA6A and 6B as pathophysiologically relevant receptors for
TcsL.
