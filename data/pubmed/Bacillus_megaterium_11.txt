Phytoextraction using Celosia argentea Linn. can potentially decontaminate
Cd-contaminated soils. However, most earlier studies have been conducted at
laboratory scale and for a relatively short remediation period. To evaluate the
phytoextraction efficiency of C. argentea combined with different soil amendments
(ammonium chloride, Bacillus megaterium, and citric acid), an 18-month field
experiment was carried out in a farmland soil contaminated with 3.68 mg kg-1 Cd
by mine tailings in southern China. Soil Cd concentrations were decreased by
6.34 ± 0.73% after the three harvestings (with no amendments), which was 2.27
times that of the no-planting control (p < 0.05). Application of ammonium
chloride, B. megaterium, and citric acid increased the overall Cd reduction rate 
in soil by 40.5%, 46.1%, and 105%, respectively. The application of citric acid
decreased total Cd in soil by up to 16.9% in the rhizosphere soil and 13.0% in
the bulk soil. The highest annual shoot biomass yield and Cd extraction amount
reached 8.79 t ha-1 and 273 g ha-1. Acid-soluble Cd fraction in the rhizosphere
was significantly lower compared to that in the bulk soil (p < 0.05), which
indicates that mobile Cd in the rhizosphere was taken up by the roots vastly.
C. argentea phytoextraction also improved soil metabolic functions by increasing 
the activities of soil enzymes (urease, invertase, phosphatase, and catalase).
These findings demonstrate that Cd phytoextraction using C. argentea with the
application of soil amendments can greatly improve the quality of Cd-contaminated
soils.
