Humans and other mammalian hosts have evolved mechanisms to control the bacteria 
colonizing their mucosal barriers to prevent invasion. While the breach of
barriers by bacteria typically leads to overt infection, increasing evidence
supports a role for translocation of commensal bacteria across an impaired gut
barrier to extraintestinal sites in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and other
chronic, non-infectious diseases. Whether gut commensal translocation is a cause 
or consequence of the disease is incompletely defined. Here we discuss factors
that lead to translocation of live bacteria across the gut barrier. We expand
upon our recently published demonstration that translocation of the gut
pathobiont Enterococcus gallinarum can induce autoimmunity in susceptible hosts
and postulate on the role of Enterococcus species as instigators of chronic,
non-infectious diseases.
