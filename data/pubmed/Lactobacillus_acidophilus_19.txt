Fermented whey-based beverages were elaborated using commercial probiotics
cultures (CHR HANSEN): BCT-1®, ABT-4®, ABC where A: Lactobacillus acidophilus, B:
Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, C: Lactobacillus paracasei subsp.
paracasei and T: Streptococccus thermophiles. Three treatments were prepared with
these probiotics cultures and a treatment without cultures added as a control.
All beverage were maintained at 4 °C and evaluated during their shelf life at 0, 
7, 14 and 21 days. The variables analyzed were peptide concentration,
proteolysis, ACE-inhibitory activity and, peptide and aromatic amino acid
profiles. Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to assess the
relationship between these variables. All whey-based fermented beverages added
with probiotics presented ACE inhibitory activity (22-100%). However, whey-based 
beverage without probiotics added had the highest ACE inhibitory activity (100%),
and it was maintained during its shelf life. Fermented beverage with ABT-4®
culture had an ACE inhibitory activity from 80 to 100% during its shelf life.
Thus can be attributed to the release of peptides during processing. Meanwhile,
significative correlations were observed between variables varying this depending
on the treatment, both, in magnitude and in direct or inverse direction
(0.684-0.986). The ACE inhibitory activity was correlated to proteolysis and
peptide and aromatic amino acids profiles. And, the IC50 was observed in the
range of 0.01-0.055 mg/mL.
