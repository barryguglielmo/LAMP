Pleural effusions and empyemas caused by Capnocytophaga spp. are uncommon with
few cases previously reported. Here, we present the case of a 62-year-old man
with untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) complicated by a pleural
empyema caused by C. ochracea. The route of acquisition was likely the result of 
aspiration of C. ochracea coupled with the immune defects associated with
untreated CLL.
