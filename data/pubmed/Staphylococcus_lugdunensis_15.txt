Summary. We report two cases of Staphylococcus lugdunensis (S. lugdunensis)
septic arthritis following arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)
reconstruction. Both initial surgical procedures were ACL reconstruction along
with simultaneous collateral ligament and meniscus procedures. Patients presented
with septic arthritis three and ten weeks following the index procedure. Both
patients successfully recovered with early arthroscopic irrigation, debridement, 
and synovial culture, in addition to long-term parenteral and oral
antibiotics.Staphylococcus lugdunensis (S. lugdunensis) septic arthritis
