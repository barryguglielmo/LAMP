C3 protein toxins produced by Clostridium (C.) botulinum and C. limosum are
mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases, which specifically modify the GTPases Rho A/B/C in 
the cytosol of monocytic cells, thereby inhibiting Rho-mediated signal
transduction in monocytes, macrophages, and osteoclasts. C3 toxins are
selectively taken up into the cytosol of monocytic cells by endocytosis and
translocate from acidic endosomes into the cytosol. The C3-catalyzed
ADP-ribosylation of Rho proteins inhibits essential functions of these immune
cells, such as migration and phagocytosis. Here, we demonstrate that C3 toxins
enter and intoxicate dendritic cells in a time- and concentration-dependent
manner. Both immature and mature human dendritic cells efficiently internalize C3
exoenzymes. These findings could also be extended to the chimeric fusion toxin
C2IN-C3lim. Moreover, stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy revealed
the localization of the internalized C3 protein in endosomes and emphasized its
potential use as a carrier to deliver foreign proteins into dendritic cells. In
contrast, the enzyme C2I from the binary C. botulinum C2 toxin was not taken up
into dendritic cells, indicating the specific uptake of C3 toxins. Taken
together, we identified human dendritic cells as novel target cells for
clostridial C3 toxins and demonstrated the specific uptake of these toxins via
endosomal vesicles.
