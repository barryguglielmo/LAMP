BACKGROUND: Lemierre syndrome is characterized by head/neck vein thrombosis and
septic embolism usually complicating an acute oropharyngeal bacterial infection
in adolescents and young adults. We described the course of Lemierre syndrome in 
the contemporary era.
METHODS: In our individual-level analysis of 712 patients (2000-2017), we
included cases described as Lemierre syndrome if these criteria were met: (i)
primary site of bacterial infection in the head/neck; (ii) objectively confirmed 
local thrombotic complications or septic embolism. The study outcomes were new or
recurrent venous thromboembolism or peripheral septic lesions, major bleeding,
all-cause death and clinical sequelae.
RESULTS: The median age was 21 (Q1-Q3: 17-33) years, and 295 (41%) were female.
At diagnosis, acute thrombosis of head/neck veins was detected in 597 (84%)
patients, septic embolism in 582 (82%) and both in 468 (80%). After diagnosis and
during in-hospital follow-up, new venous thromboembolism occurred in 34 (5.2%,
95% CI 3.8-7.2%) patients, new peripheral septic lesions became evident in 76
(11.7%; 9.4-14.3%). The rate of either was lower in patients who received
anticoagulation (OR: 0.59; 0.36-0.94), higher in those with initial intracranial 
involvement (OR: 2.35; 1.45-3.80). Major bleeding occurred in 19 patients (2.9%; 
1.9-4.5%), and 26 died (4.0%; 2.7-5.8%). Clinical sequelae were reported in 65
(10.4%, 8.2-13.0%) individuals, often consisting of cranial nerve palsy (n = 24) 
and orthopaedic limitations (n = 19).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Lemierre syndrome were characterized by a substantial 
risk of new thromboembolic complications and death. This risk was higher in the
presence of initial intracranial involvement. One-tenth of survivors suffered
major clinical sequelae.
