Periodontitis is positively linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes,
cancer, and increased mortality. Empirically derived clusters of IgG antibodies
against 19 selected periodontal microorganisms have been associated with
hyperglycemia. We further investigated associations between these serum IgG
antibody clusters and all-cause and CVD mortality in a representative US
population. Participants free of CVD and cancer and aged â‰¥40 y at baseline (N =
6,491) from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988 to
1994) were followed up until December 31, 2011. Antibodies were categorized into 
4 clusters: red-green, orange-red, yellow-orange, and orange-blue. Over a 23-y
follow-up, 2,702 deaths occurred, including 810 CVD-related deaths. In fully
adjusted Cox proportional hazard models, the red-green cluster was positively
associated with all-cause mortality (tertile 3 vs. tertile 1: hazard ratio [HR] =
1.43, 95% CI = 1.08 to 1.90, P = 0.015). The yellow-orange cluster was inversely 
associated with all-cause mortality (tertile 3 vs. tertile 1: HR = 0.78, 95% CI =
0.63 to 0.97, P = 0.028) and CVD mortality (tertile 2 vs. tertile 1: HR = 0.57,
95% CI = 0.42 to 0.77, P = 0.005). The orange-blue cluster (composed of
antibodies against Eubacterium nodatum and Actinomyces naeslundii) was inversely 
associated with all-cause mortality (tertile 3 vs. tertile 1: HR = 0.65, 95% CI =
0.55 to 0.78, P < 0.0001) and CVD mortality (tertile 3 vs. tertile 1: HR = 0.65, 
95% CI = 0.47 to 0.88, P = 0.007). These antibodies could predict prognosis or be
potential intervention targets to prevent systemic effects of periodontal disease
if further studies establish a causal relationship.
