BACKGROUND: Recently, the link between obesity and gut microbiota has become a
focus for research. This study shed some light on the modification of
postoperative gut microbial composition after bariatric surgery.
METHODS: A prospective longitudinal study on healthy lean subjects and patients
who underwent bariatric surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and laparoscopic sleeve
gastrectomy) was carried out. Anthropometric and metabolic data, smoking, food
preferences data, and stool samples were collected from lean subjects and from
obese patients before and 3 and 6 months after surgery (T0, T3, and T6,
respectively).
RESULTS: We collected stool samples from 25 obese patients before surgery and 3
and 6 months thereafter and from 25 normal weight patients. After Roux-en-Y
gastric bypass, Yokenella regensburgei (p < 0.05), Fusobacterium varium
(p < 0.05), Veillonella dispar/atypica (p < 0.05), and Streptococcus
australis/gordonii (p < 0.05) were transiently identified in the gut at T3.
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients had a permanent increase in Akkermansia
muciniphila (p < 0.05), which is associated with healthy metabolism, both at T3
and T6. There were no significant changes in gut microbiota in laparoscopic
sleeve gastrectomy patients.
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass induced major microbial
differences and greater weight loss compared with laparoscopic sleeve
gastrectomy. Analyzing the microbiota composition, a proliferation of potential
pathogens and the onset of beneficial bacteria was observed. The effects of these
bacteria on human health are still far from clear. Understanding the mechanisms
of action of these bacteria could be the keystone in developing new therapeutic
strategies for obesity.
