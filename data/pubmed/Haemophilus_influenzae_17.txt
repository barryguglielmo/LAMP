After a development period of around 13 years, in 1993 the vaccination against
infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) was introduced into the 
Dutch National Immunisation Programme. Before the introduction of the
vaccination, the burden of disease was high; every year around 700 children
acquired an invasive Hib infection, half of whom developed meningitis. Of those
children with Hib-related meningitis, 2% died and more than 8% were left with
severe residual symptoms. Furthermore, at least one-third of those who recovered 
developed learning and concentration problems. Hib also caused other infections
such as epiglottitis, osteomyelitis and arthritis. Initially, the conjugated Hib 
vaccine PRP-T was given as a separate injection. From 2005 onwards PRP-T was
included in the combination DTaP-IPV-Hib vaccine, and since 2011 PRP-T has been
part of the DTaP-IPV-Hib-HepB vaccine. Although H. influenzae is still around,
invasive Hib infections in children now occur only very rarely.
