Chlorin-e6 (Ce6), as a photosensitizer (PS), has demonstrated significant
reduction of microorganisms' viability when irradiated by red light. However, the
main absorption peak of this PS is located at blue light spectrum, never
investigated. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of pure-chlorin-e6-mediated
photodynamic inactivation (PDI) using different light sources (450 or 660 nm)
against biofilms related to periodontitis. Streptococcus oralis, Fusobacterium
nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans
single-species biofilms were developed under proper conditions for five days. PDI
was performed using different concentrations of Ce6 (100 and 200 mM), wavelengths
(450 and 660 nm) and comparisons were made after colony forming unit and confocal
laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) analysis. The use of light and PS were also
individually tested. The greatest bacterial elimination was observed in the group
where PDI was employed with blue light and concentration of 200 mM for all
bacterial strains tested (4.01 log10 for A. actinomycetemcomitans, and total
elimination for P. gingivalis and S. oralis), except for F. nucleatum, where 3.46
log10 reduction was observed when red light and 200 mM Ce6 were applied
(p < 0.05). The antimicrobial effects of PDI mediated by Ce6 for all single
pathogenic biofilms were confirmed by live/dead staining under CLSM analysis. For
all single-species biofilms, the use of PDI mediated by chlorin-e6
photosensitizer under blue or red-light irradiation (450 and 660 nm) demonstrated
a significant reduction in bacterial viability, but blue light showed a promising
higher photobiological effect, encouraging its adjuvant use to basic
periodontitis treatment.
