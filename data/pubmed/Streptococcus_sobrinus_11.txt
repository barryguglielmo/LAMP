BACKGROUND: Dental caries is considered to be a preventable disease, and various 
antimicrobial agents have been developed for the prevention of dental disease.
However, many bacteria show resistance to existing agents.
METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, four known 1,4-naphthoquinones and
newly synthesized 10 pyrimidinone-fused 1,4-naphthoquinones, i.e. KHQ 701, 702,
711, 712, 713, 714, 715, 716, 717 and 718, were evaluated for antimicrobial
activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus
aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus,
Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinomyces viscosus and Fusobacterium nucleatum.
Pyrimidinone-fused 1,4-naphthoquinones were synthesized in good yields through a 
series of chemical reactions from a commercially available 1,4-dihydroxynaphthoic
acid. MIC values of KHQ 711, 712, 713, 714, 715, 716, 717 and 718 were 6.25-50
μg/mL against E. faecalis (CCARM 5511), 6.25-25 μg/mL against E. faecium
(KACC11954) and S. aureus (CCARM 3506), 1.56-25 μg/mL against S. epidermidis
(KACC 13234), 3.125-100 μg/mL against S. mutans (KACC16833), 1.56-100 μg/mL
against S. sobrinus (KCTC5809) and P. gingivalis (KCTC 5352), 3.125-50 μg/mL
against A. viscosus (KCTC 9146) and 3.125-12.5 μg/mL against F. nucleatum (KCTC
2640) with a broth microdilution assay. A disk diffusion assay with KHQ
derivatives also exhibited strong susceptibility with inhibition zones of 0.96 to
1.2 cm in size against P. gingivalis. Among the 10 compounds evaluated, KHQ 711, 
712, 713, 715, 716 and 717 demonstrated strong antimicrobial activities against
the 9 types of pathogenic oral bacteria. A pyrimidin-4-one moiety comprising a
phenyl group at the C2 position and a benzyl group at the N3 position appears to 
be essential for physiological activity.
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Pyrimidinone-fused 1,4-naphthoquinones synthesized from 
simple starting compounds and four known 1,4-naphthoquinones were synthesized and
showed strong antibacterial activity to the 9 common oral bacteria. These results
suggest that these derivatives should be prospective for the treatment of dental 
diseases caused by oral bacteria, including drug-resistant strains.
