BACKGROUND: Clostridium tetani is an anaerobic, gram-positive bacillus that
causes tetanus infection. It usually enters the body through injury with
contaminated objects. Tetanus differs from other diseases that can be prevented
by vaccination in that it is not contagious and does not spread from person to
person. The aim of this study is to evaluate the levels of Tetanus IgG in trauma 
patients admitted to the emergency department (ED).
METHODS: The study was planned as cross-sectional, prospective, and
single-center. The study was conducted from January to July 2018 in the
Kahramanmaraş Sütçü İmam University Hospital. Totally, 178 patients aged ≥18
years were included. For measurement of the level of Tetanus IgG, Clostridium
tetani toxin 5S IgG kit (NovaLisa, NOVATEC) was used to quantitatively detect IgG
type antibodies by micro-ELISA method in accordance with the manufacturer's
recommendation.
RESULTS: In total, 143 cases were male and 35 were female. The mean age of the
cases was 40 ± 16 years. Tetanus IgG levels were found to be 0.29 ± 0.6 IU/mL in 
cases from rural areas and 2.14 ± 1.64 IU/mL in cases from urban areas (P <
0.001). There was a negative correlation between age and Tetanus IgG level (r:
(-) 0.479; P < 0.001). The protective level of Tetanus IgG was observed to be
even lower, especially in patients aged ≥40 years (n = 43, 78.9%).
CONCLUSION: Measurements of Tetanus IgG levels should be performed as far as
possible in the ED. In this way, unnecessary vaccination can be avoided.
