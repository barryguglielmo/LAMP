INTRODUCTION: Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH), the leading complication in the
intensive care unit, significantly disturbs the gut microbial composition by
decreasing the relative abundance of Lactobacillus and increasing the relative
abundance of opportunistic infectious bacteria.
METHODS: To evaluate the preventative effect of Lactobacillus-based probiotics on
IAH-induced intestinal barrier damages, a single-species probiotics (L92) and a
multi-species probiotics (VSL#3) were introduced orally to Sprague-Dawley rats
for 7 days before inducing IAH. The intestinal histology and permeability to
macromolecules (fluoresceine isothiocyanate, FITC-dextran, N = 8 for each group),
the parameters of immunomodulatory and oxidative responses [Monocyte chemotactic 
protein 1(MCP-1), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-10
(IL-10), malonaldehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GSH- Px), catalase (CAT),
and superoxide dismutase (SOD); N = 4 for each group], and the microbiome
profiling (N = 4 for each group) were analyzed.
RESULTS: 7-day pretreatments of L92 significantly alleviated the IAH-induced
increase in intestinal permeability to FITC-dextran and histological
damage(P < 0.0001), accompanied with the suppression of inflammatory and
oxidative activation. The increase of MCP-1 and IL-1β were significantly
inhibited (P < 0.05); the anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-4 and IL-10 were
maintained at high levels; and the suppression of CAT (P < 0.05) were
significantly reversed when pretreated with L92. On the contrary, no significant 
protective effects were observed in the VSL#3-pretreated group. Among the 84
identified species, 260 MetaCyc pathways, and 217 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG) pathways, the protective effects of L92 were correlated with an
increased relative abundance of Bacteroides finegoldii, Odoribacter splanchnicus,
and the global activation of amino acid biosynthesis pathways, especially the
glutamate-glutamine biosynthesis pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: 7-day pretreatment with a single-species probiotics can prevent IAH 
induced severe intestinal barrier dysfunction, potentially through microbial
modulation.
