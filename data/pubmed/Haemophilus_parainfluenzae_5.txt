The application of CLSI and EUCAST guidelines led to many discrepancies. Various 
doubts have already appeared in preliminary stages of microbiological diagnostics
of Haemophilus spp. A total of 87 H. parainfluenzae isolates were obtained from
throat or nasopharyngeal swabs from adults 18 to 70 years old, both healthy
volunteers and patients with chronic diseases between 2013 to 2015 in eastern
Poland. Haemophilus spp. were identified by colony morphology, Gram-staining, API
NH and MALDI-TOF MS technique. Both susceptibility to various antimicrobials and 
phenotypes of Haemophilus spp. resistance to beta-lactams were determined.
Statistically significant association between applied guidelines and drug
resistance patterns were observed to as follows: ampicillin, cefuroxime,
cefotaxime, amoxicillin-clavulanate, azithromycin, tetracycline and
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Resistance phenotypes according to CLSI vs. EUCAST
were as follows: 3.4% vs. 8.0% for BLNAR and 6.9% vs. 19.5% for BLPACR isolates. 
In conclusion, this is the first study that reports comparative analysis of drug 
susceptibility interpretation using CLSI and EUCAST of haemophili rods from human
respiratory microbiota in Poland. In case of susceptible, increased exposure
(formerly intermediate) category of susceptibility within H. parainfluenzae
isolates we have observed EUCAST as more restrictive than CLSI. Moreover, BLNAI
and BLPAI phenotype isolates have been observed, as well as BLPBR using only CLSI
or EUCAST guidelines, respectively.
