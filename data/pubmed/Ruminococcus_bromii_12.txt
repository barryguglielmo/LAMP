The human intestinal commensal microbiota and associated metabolic products have 
long been regarded as contributors to host health. As the identity and activities
of the various members of this community have become clearer, newly identified
health-associated bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Akkermansia
muciniphila, Ruminococcus bromii and Roseburia species, have emerged. Notably,
the abundance of many of these bacteria is inversely correlated to several
disease states. While technological and regulatory hurdles may limit the use of
strains from these taxa as probiotics, it should be possible to utilize
prebiotics and other dietary components to selectively enhance their growth in
situ. Dietary components of potential relevance include well-established
prebiotics, such as galacto-oligosaccharides, fructo-oligosaccharides and inulin,
while other putative prebiotics, such as other oligosaccharides, polyphenols,
resistant starch, algae and seaweed as well as host gut metabolites such as
lactate and acetate, may also be applied with the aim of selectively and/or
differentially affecting the beneficial bacterial community within the
gastrointestinal environment. The present review provides an overview of the
dietary components that could be applied in this manner.
