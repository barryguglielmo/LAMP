We report a case of a 3-day-old boy with Neisseria cinerea conjunctivitis,
originally misidentified as Neisseria gonorrhoeae conjunctivitis. Neonates are at
increased risk for disseminated gonococcal infection, and physicians should be
cognizant of N cinerea and its potential to be mistaken for N gonorrhoeae.
