Klebsiella variicola is an emerging pathogen responsible for causing blood-stream
infections, urinary and respiratory tract related diseases in humans. In this
report, we describe the genome sequence data and phenotypic characterization of
K. variicola strain KV093 isolated from India. Comparative genome sequence
analysis revealed the presence of genes linked with virulence, iron acquisition
and transport, type 1 and type 3 pili, secretion systems including the capsular
gene cluster. The plant-associated genes such as nitrogen fixation, growth and
defense mechanisms against oxidative stress were also identified. On performing
antibiotic susceptibility testing, growth inhibition, and stress challenge assays
it was observed that the drug resistant K. variicola KV093 exhibited cross
resistance to various antibiotics, antiseptics, including disinfectants. This
report highlights the arsenal of virulence and antibiotic resistance determinants
in K. variicola KV093, an effort emphasizing the current pressing need for
regular surveillance of K. variicola strains especially in India.
