OBJECTIVES: To characterize the gut microbiota profile in rheumatoid arthritis
(RA) patients and investigate its association with certain characteristics of RA.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A nested case-control cohort of 40 patients with RA and 40 
sex-age matched controls was studied. Subjects with diabetes, with any other
inflammatory disease, practicing extreme diets, taking antibiotics, probiotics or
under any new treatment for at least three months prior to sampling were
excluded. The microbiota composition was determined by 16S rRNA pyrosequencing
and bioinformatics analysis by Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology
(QIIME). Other variables included clinical-laboratory variables and average
Disease Activity Score 28 points during the follow-up period. Multiple linear
regression models were constructed to investigate the possible risk factors for
the microbiota.
RESULTS: β-diversity data showed that patients tend to differ from healthy
subjects according to their microbiota (p = 0.07). The analysis showed an
increase in Collinsella aerofaciens, Sedimentibacter and Enterococcus genera in
patients compared to controls, as well as a decrease in Dorea formicigenerans.
Likewise, an increase in the activity of arginine deiminase was observed, which
was found in approximately 90% of the RA genes of the genus Collinsela. The
sequence number of Collinsella aerofaciens was independently associated with age 
(B (95%CI), -0.347 (-21.6, -2.1)), high ACPA (0.323 (27.4-390.0)) and smoking
(0.300 (8.8-256.4)) in RA patients. In addition, we observed decreases in
Sarcina, 02d06 and Porphyromonas bacterial lineages.
CONCLUSION: Patients with RA present dysbiosis, resulting from an abundance of
certain bacterial lineages and a decrease in others. These alterations could
influence the maintenance of autoimmunity to this disease.
