Two novel phosphoethanolamine transferase genes, eptAv7 and eptAv3, were
identified in the chromosome of an Aeromonas jandaei isolate from retail fish.
The variants showed 79.9% and 80.0% amino acid identity to MCR-7.1 and MCR-3.1,
respectively, and increased colistin resistance 128- to 256-fold in Aeromonas
salmonicida. The two variants with no mobile genetic element in the flanking
regions were also observed in other Aeromonas species. This finding supports the 
view that Aeromonas is a reservoir for MCR-3 and MCR-7 mobile colistin
resistance.
