OBJECTIVES: Multidrug-resistant (MDR) enterococci are found extensively in food
samples. This study characterized the phenotypic virulence factors and the
ability of horizontal gene transfer of a streptomycin resistance gene among
enterococci isolated from fermented pork.
METHODS: Thirty-six MDR enterococci were subjected to screening of gelatinase,
biofilm formation at various temperatures (4 °C, 25 °C and 37 °C), clumping
ability and conjugation.
RESULTS: All gelatinase-positive and clumping-positive strains were Enterococcus 
faecalis (41.7% and 38.9%, respectively). None of Enterococcus faecium and
Enterococcus hirae demonstrated both phenotypes. Moderate and strong biofilm
formations were found mostly at optimal temperatures in all the three species
tested. However, moderate and weak biofilm formations could be found in 52.8% at 
4 °C. No association was observed between biofilm formation and asa1, efaA, gelE 
and esp genes. Surprisingly, our data revealed evidence of the streptomycin
resistance gene (aadE) being transferred among meat E. faecalis isolates as
characterized by the pheromone-clumping response.
CONCLUSIONS: Here we report the co-existence of some virulence factors and MDR
enterococci from fermented pork. Our data demonstrated for the first time that
the aadE gene could be transferred via conjugation among enterococci isolated
from meat, contributing to streptomycin resistance. This study highlights the
importance of horizontal gene transfer within the food chain reservoir and that
transfer to humans might be possible, causing harm or untreatable diseases.
