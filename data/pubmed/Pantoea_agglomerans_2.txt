Infectious diseases are one of the major drivers of coral reef decline worldwide.
White plague-like disease (WPL) is a widespread disease with a complex etiology
that infects several coral species, including the Brazilian endemic species
Mussismilia braziliensis. Gene expression profiles of healthy and WPL-affected M.
braziliensis were analyzed in winter and summer seasons. The de novo assembly of 
the M. braziliensis transcriptome from healthy and white plague samples produced 
a reference transcriptome containing 119,088 transcripts. WPL-diseased samples
were characterized by repression of immune system and cellular defense processes.
Autophagy and cellular adhesion transcripts were also repressed in WPL samples,
suggesting exhaustion of the coral host defenses. Seasonal variation leads to
plasticity in transcription with upregulation of intracellular signal
transduction, apoptosis regulation, and oocyte development in the summer.
Analysis of the active bacterial rRNA indicated that Pantoea bacteria were more
abundant in WPL corals, while Tistlia, Fulvivirga, and Gammaproteobacteria
Ga0077536 were more abundant in healthy samples. Cyanobacteria proliferation was 
also observed in WPL, mostly in the winter. These results indicate a scenario of 
dysbiosis in WPL-affected M. braziliensis, with the loss of potentially symbiotic
bacteria and proliferation of opportunistic microbes after the start of the
infection process.
