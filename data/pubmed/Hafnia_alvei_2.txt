The serp gene codes for a protease that is considered to be an important factor
associated with quorum sensing (QS)-based food spoilage caused by microorganisms.
In this study, we evaluated the effect of temperature (4-37 °C) and QS inhibitors
on the production of N-acyl-L-homoserine lactones (AHLs) and relative expression 
of the luxR/I, as well as serp in Hafnia alvei H4. Production of AHLs and
expression of luxR/I were found to reach maximum levels at 10 °C, suggesting that
the QS system of H. alvei H4 might have higher activity at low temperatures;
similar result was also obtained for serp expression. Mutants of H. alvei H4
deficient in QS were used to identify the regulation of QS on serp expression.
Significant reduction (P < 0.05) in serp expression was found in the mutants
∆luxR, ∆luxI, and ∆luxR/I, with ∆luxI and ∆luxR/I showing greater reduction than 
∆luxR. Minimum inhibition concentrations (MIC) of Benzyl isothiocyanate and
3-Methylthiopropyl isothiocyanate for H. alvei H4 were determined to be 7.813 and
15.625 mM, respectively. Furthermore, the expression of serp, as well as that of 
luxR and luxI, was significantly repressed (P < 0.05) by the two QS inhibitors at
1/8 MIC and 1/16 MIC, indicating that these inhibitors might repress serp
expression through affecting luxR and luxI expression in H. alvei H4. The
findings of this study, therefore, suggested that food spoilage caused by H.
alvei could be controlled through the application of QS inhibitors.
