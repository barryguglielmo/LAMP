An obligately anaerobic, Gram-stain-negative, rod or coccobacilli organism was
isolated from a faecal sample of a healthy Japanese woman. In the 16S rRNA gene
sequence analysis, strain 5BBH33T showed the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence
similarity to Dialister succinatiphilus YIT 11850T (95.9 %), Dialister
propionicifaciens ADV 1053.03T (94.3 %), Dialister micraerophilus DSM 19965T
(93.1 %), Dialister invisus DSM 15470T (92.5 %) and Dialister pneumosintes ATCC
33048T (91.4 %). The hsp60 gene sequence analysis also revealed strain 5BBH33T
had relatively low hsp60 gene sequence similarities (74.4-85.3 %) to other
Dialister species. Strain 5BBH33T showed 21.8-23.9 % in silico DNA-DNA
hybridization values with other Dialister species. In addition, the average
nucleotide identity values between strain 5BBH33T and other Dialister species
ranged from 68.7-74.2 %, indicating that this strain should be considered as new 
species based on whole-genome relatedness. Strain 5BBH33T was asaccharolytic and 
largely unreactive for commercial kit. However, its growth was enhanced by adding
1 % (w/v) succinate to the medium; strain 5BBH33T was able to decarboxylate
succinate to propionate. The strain 5BBH33T genome contained the enzymes involved
in succinate utilization. These results improve our understanding of
succinate-utilizing bacteria. On the basis of the collected data, strain 5BBH33T 
represents a novel species in the genus Dialister, for which the name Dialister
hominis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of D. hominis is 5BBH33T (=JCM
33369T=DSM 109768T).
