Humans are host to a multitude of microorganisms that rapidly populate the body
at birth, subject to a complex interplay that is dependent on host genetics,
lifestyle, and environment. The host-associated microbiome, including the oral
microbiome, presents itself in a complex ecosystem important to health and
disease. As the most common chronic disease globally, dental caries is induced by
host-microbial dysbiosis in children and adults. Multiple biological and
environmental factors are likely to impact disease predisposition, onset,
progression, and severity, yet longitudinal studies able to capture these
influences are missing. To investigate how host genetics and environment
influenced the oral microbial communities over time, we profiled supragingival
plaque microbiomes of dizygotic and monozygotic twins during 3 visits over
12-months. Dental plaque DNA samples were amplified by targeting the 16S rRNA
gene V4 region, and microbial findings were correlated with clinical, diet and
genetic metadata. We observed that the oral microbiome variances were shaped
primarily by the environment when compared to host genetics. Among the
environmental factors shaping microbial changes of our subjects, significant
metadata included age of the subject, and the age by which subjects initiated
brushing habits, and the types of actions post-brushing. Relevant heritability of
the microbiome included Actinomyces and Capnocytophaga in monozygotic twins and
Kingella in dizygotic twins. Corynebacterium and Veillonella abundances were
associated with age, whereas Aggregatibacter was associated with younger
subjects. Streptococcus abundance showed an inverse association over time, and
Selenomonas abundances increased with brushing frequency per day. Unraveling the 
exact biological mechanisms in caries has the potential to reveal novel
host-microbial biomarkers, pathways, and targets important to effective
preventive measures, and early disease control in children.
