OBJECTIVE: To compare the microbicidal activity of low-temperature sterilization 
technologies (vaporized hydrogen peroxide [VHP], ethylene oxide [ETO], and
hydrogen peroxide gas plasma [HPGP]) to steam sterilization in the presence of
salt and serum to simulate inadequate precleaning.
METHODS: Test carriers were inoculated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia
coli, Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, Mycobacterium
terrae, Bacillus atrophaeus spores, Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores, or
Clostridiodes difficile spores in the presence of salt and serum and then
subjected to 4 sterilization technologies: steam, ETO, VHP and HPGP.
RESULTS: Steam, ETO, and HPGP sterilization techniques were capable of
inactivating the test organisms on stainless steel carriers with a failure rate
of 0% (0 of 220), 1.9% (6 of 310), and 1.9% (5 of 270), respectively. The failure
rate for VHP was 76.3% (206 of 270).
CONCLUSION: Steam sterilization is the most effective and had the largest margin 
of safety, followed by ETO and HPGP, but VHP showed much less efficacy.
