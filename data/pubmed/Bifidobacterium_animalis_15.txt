A fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase-positive strain (GSD1FST) was isolated
from a faecal sample of a 3 weeks old German Shepherd dog. The closest related
taxa to isolate GSD1FST based on results from the EZBioCloud database were
Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis ATCC 25527T, Bifidobacterium animalis
subsp. lactis DSM 10140T and Bifidobacterium anseris LMG 30189T, belonging to the
Bifidobacterium pseudolongum phylogenetic group. The resulting 16S rRNA gene
identities (compared length of 1454 nucleotides) towards these taxa were 97.30,
97.23 and 97.09 %, respectively. The pairwise similarities of strain GSD1FST
using argS, atpA, fusA, hsp60, pyrG, rpsC, thrS and xfp gene fragments to all
valid representatives of the B. pseudolongum phylogenetic group were in the
concatenated range of 83.08-88.34 %. Phylogenomic analysis based on whole-genome 
methods such as average nucleotide identity revealed that bifidobacterial strain 
GSD1FST exhibits close phylogenetic relatedness (88.17 %) to Bifidobacetrium
cuniculi LMG 10738T. Genotypic characteristics and phylogenetic analyses based on
nine molecular markers, as well as genomic and comparative phenotypic analyses,
clearly proved that the evaluated strain should be considered as representing a
novel species within the B. pseudolongum phylogenetic group named as
Bifidobacterium canis sp. nov. (GSD1FST=DSM 105923T=LMG 30345T=CCM 8806T).
