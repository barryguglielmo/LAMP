OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the changes of vaginal microbiota during cervical
carcinogenesis in women with high-risk human papillomavirus infection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vaginal microbiota was analyzed using next-generation
sequencing in women with normal, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), or
cervical cancer.
RESULTS: A marked decrease of Lactobacillus crispatus was found in the CIN/cancer
groups compared with that in the normal group. The diversity of microorganisms
increased in patients with CIN or cervical cancer with HPV infection. Atopobium
vaginae (OR 4.33, 95% CI 1.15-16.32), Dialister invisus (OR 4.89, 95% CI
1.20-19.94), Finegoldia magna (OR 6.00, 95% CI 1.08-33.27), Gardnerella vaginalis
(OR 7.43, 95% CI 1.78-31.04), Prevotella buccalis (OR 11.00, 95% CI 2.00-60.57), 
and Prevotella timonensis (OR 6.00, 95% CI 1.46-24.69) were significantly
associated with the risk of CIN 2/3 or cervical cancer.
CONCLUSION: Women with the CIN and cervical cancer showed a high diversity in
vaginal microbiota. Depletion of Lactobacillus crispatus and increased abundance 
of anaerobic bacteria were detected in women with cervical disease.
