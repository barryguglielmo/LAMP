BACKGROUND: β-galactosidases are enzymes that are utilized to hydrolyze lactose
into galactose and glucose, and are is widely used in the food industry.
OBJECTIVE: We describe the recombinant expression of an unstudied, heterodimeric 
β-galactosidase originating from Lactobacillus brevis ATCC 367 in Escherichia
coli. Furthermore, six different constructs, in which the two protein subunits
were fused with different peptide linkers.
METHOD: The heterodimeric subunits of the β-galactosidase were cloned in
expressed in various expression constructs, by using either two vectors for the
independent expression of each subunit, or using a single Duet vector for the
co-expression of the two subunits.
RESULTS: The co-expression in two independent expression vectors only resulted in
low β-galactosidase activities, whereas the co-expression in a single Duet vector
of the independent and fused subunits increased the β-galactosidase activity
significantly. The recombinant β-galactosidase showed comparable hydrolyzing
properties towards lactose, N-acetyllactosamine, and pNP-β-D-galactoside.
CONCLUSION: The usability of the recombinant L. brevis β-galactosidase was
further demonstrated by the hydrolysis of human, bovine, and goat milk samples.
The herein presented fused β-galactosidase constructs may be of interest for
analytical research as well as in food- and biotechnological applications.
