A number of veterinary clinical pathology laboratories in New Zealand have been
reporting emergence of increased minimum in inhibitory concentrations for
β-lactams in the common clinical bovine mastitis pathogen Streptococcus uberis.
The objective of this study was to determine the genetic basis of this increase
in MIC for β-lactams amongst S. uberis. Illumina sequencing and determination of 
oxacillin MIC was performed on 265 clinical isolates. Published sequences of the 
five penicillin binding proteins pbp1a, pbp1b, pbp2a, pbp2b, and pbp2x were used 
to identify, extract and align these sequences from the study isolates. Amino
acid substitutions resulting from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) within
these genes were analysed for associations with elevated (≥ 0.5 mg/L) oxacillin
MIC together with a genome wide association study. The population structure of
the study isolates was approximated using a phylogenetic tree generated from an
alignment of the core genome. A total of 53 % of isolates had MIC ≥ 0.5 mg/L for 
oxacillin. A total of 101 substitutions within the five pbp were identified, of
which 11 were statistically associated with an MIC ≥ 0.5 mg/L. All 140 isolates
which exhibited an increased β-lactam MIC had SNPs leading to pbp2x E381K and
Q554E substitutions. The phylogenetic tree indicated that the genotype and
phenotype associated with the increased MIC for oxacillin were present in several
different lineages suggesting that acquisition of this increased β-lactam MIC had
occurred in multiple geographically distinct regions. Reanalysis of the data from
the intervention studies from which the isolates were originally drawn found a
tendency for the pbp2x E381K substitution to be associated with lower cure rates.
It is concluded that there is geographically and genetically widespread presence 
of pbp substitutions associated with reduced susceptibility to β-lactam
antimicrobials. Additionally, presence of pbp substitutions tended to be
associated with poorer cure rate outcomes following antimicrobial therapy for
clinical mastitis.
