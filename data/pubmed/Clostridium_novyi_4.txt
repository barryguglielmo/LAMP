The current study was designed to evaluate the in vivo fasciolicidal activity of 
Moringa (M.) oleifera leaf aqueous extract oral administration as well as its
antibacterial activity against Clostridium (C.) novyi in sheep naturally
co-infected with fascioliasis and C. novyi. Sheep naturally infected with
fascioliasis were divided into 3 groups, heavily infected treated group, lightly 
infected treated group and mixed infection control (non-treated) group. Treatment
groups were orally administered M. oleifera leaves aqueous extract at a dose of
150 mg/kg every 48 h for 21 days. Animal body weights, fecal egg count, serum
levels of anti-Fasciola IgG, cytokines (IL-2, IL-17, IL-10), and bacterial count 
of C. novyi were evaluated. The results showed that treatment with M. oleifera
improved the body weight gain and decreased fecal egg count in lightly and
heavily infected groups compared to the nontreated group with 100% reduction in
egg count in lightly infected sheep. Furthermore, the treatment with M. oleifera 
significantly reduced the serum levels of IgG, IL-2, and IL-17. Interestingly,
elevated levels of IL-10 were recorded in both heavily and lightly infected
sheep. The treatment with Moringa extract significantly decreased the fecal
bacterial count of C. novyi in both heavily and lightly infected groups. In
conclusion, this study highlights the potential beneficial effects of M. oleifera
leaf against Fasciola (F.) gigantica and C. novyi.
