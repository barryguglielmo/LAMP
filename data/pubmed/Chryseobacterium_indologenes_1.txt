Chryseobacterium indologenes is a non-glucose fermenting Gram-negative bacteria
widely distributed in nature. It has been found to cause a variety of infections 
like nosocomial pneumonia, bacteremia and wound infections usually in
immunosuppressed patients and those with indwelling devices. The organism is
resistant to a significant number of the commonly prescribed broad spectrum
antibiotics. We report a rare case of meningitis due to C. indologenes in a
patient diagnosed with medulloblastoma and hydrocephalus with an external
ventricular drain in situ. The patient was successfully treated with
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole combination and external ventricular drain
replacement as shown by subsequent sterile cultures.
