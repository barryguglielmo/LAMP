Background: Little is known about long-term morbidity and mortality in Whipple's 
disease (WD). Aim: To describe morbidity and mortality in patients with WD on a
long-term follow-up. Materials & methods: Comorbidities, mortality and causes of 
death were retrospectively registered. Results: A total of 35 patients with WD
(9F, 54 ± 11 years) were followed-up for a median of 104 months. Nine patients
developed ten complications; three patients died. A total of 31 severe
comorbidities apparently unrelated to WD were found in 20 patients:
preneoplastic/neoplastic disorders in seven, thromboembolic and cardiovascular
events in seven, pneumonia in four, candidiasis in ten patients. Conclusion: WD
is frequently complicated by potentially life-threatening infectious, neoplastic 
and thromboembolic disorders, thus highlighting the need for a life-long
multidisciplinary follow-up.
