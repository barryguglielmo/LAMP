Spontaneous preterm birth is associated with vaginal microbial dysbiosis. As
certain strains of lactobacilli help restore homeostasis in non-pregnant women,
the goal was to determine the effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and
Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14 administered orally, twice daily for 12 weeks on the 
vaginal microbiota, cytokines and chemokines of low-risk pregnant women. A
double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial comparing probiotic
lactobacilli to placebo daily was performed in 86 asymptomatic pregnant women who
had an Intermediate or Bacterial Vaginosis Nugent score at 13 weeks. After drop
outs, 32 women receiving probiotics and 34 receiving placebo completed the study.
The Nugent score returned to normal in 30% of the women in both groups at 28
weeks and was maintained until 35 weeks. The majority of subjects had normal
pregnancy outcomes. Ninety-three bacterial species were detected at 13 weeks,
with Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus crispatus, Gardnerella vaginalis and
Atopobium vaginae being the most abundant across pregnancy. There was no
difference in the Shannon diversity index between the probiotic and placebo
groups at 13, 28 or 35 weeks. Almost all subjects consumed fermented foods and
many of the organisms in the vagina are also known to be present in fermented
foods. Interleukin-4 in the placebo group and Interleukin-10 in both probiotic
and placebo groups increased slightly at 28 weeks but were not different at 35
weeks when compared to 13 weeks. In conclusion, this study showed no adverse
issues resulting from 12 week use of probiotic Lactobacillus strains GR-1 and
RC-14 during pregnancy in women at low risk for premature birth. The vaginal
microbiota demonstrated flux irrespective of this oral probiotic administration.
