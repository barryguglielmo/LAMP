During the last decades, essential oils (EOs) have been proven to be a natural
alternative to additives or pasteurization for the prevention of microbial
spoilage in several food matrices. In this work, we tested the antimicrobial
activity of EOs from Melissa officinalis, Ocimum basilicum, and Thymus vulgaris
against three different microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Clostridium
tyrobutyricum, and Penicillium verrucosum. Pressed ewes' cheese made from milk
fortified with EOs (250 mg/kg) was used as a model. The carryover effect of each 
oil was studied by analyzing the volatile fraction of dairy samples along the
cheese-making process using headspace stir bar sorptive extraction coupled to gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry. Results showed that the EOs contained in T.
vulgaris effectively reduced the counts of C. tyrobutyricum and inhibited
completely the growth of P. verrucosum without affecting the natural flora
present in the cheese. By contrast, the inhibitory effect of M. officinalis
against lactic acid bacteria starter cultures rendered this oil unsuitable for
this matrix.
