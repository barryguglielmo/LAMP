Eikenella corrodens is one of the HACEK bacteria that is commensal microorganism 
of the oropharngeal flora. E. corrodens has been increasingly reported to cause
pyogenic abscesses, especially in diabetic or immunocompromised adults. It is
less frequently reported in immunocompotent children. Here, we report a deep neck
infection, including the thyroid gland, in a previously healthy girl. E.
corrodens was the only microorganism isolated in two different cultures.
Antibiotic susceptibility is variable, in contrast to other oropharyngeal
pathogens. Thus, to avoid delayed treatment, E. corrodens should always be
considered in infections of the head and neck area.
