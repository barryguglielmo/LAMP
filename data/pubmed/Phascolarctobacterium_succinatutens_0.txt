This study's objective was to investigate how legume type and processing method
affected digestibility, and subsequent gut microbiota and short chain fatty acid 
(SCFA) formation. After autoclaving and germinating-cooking, pinto bean and
soybean were subjected to in vitro digestion. The digestion residues were
fractionated into soluble and insoluble fiber, and fermented by microbiota from
pig feces. Results showed the in vitro digestibility was affected significantly
by processing method and legume type. Autoclaving resulted in higher
digestibility. The in-vitro digested bean residues caused a rapid pH decrease in 
the first 12 h during the fermentation with pig feces, and a significant increse 
in the formation of SCFAs. A positive modulation of the gut microbiota by the
in-vitro digested bean residues was observed. Prevotella copri and Bacteroides
vulgatus exhibited the highest relative abundance in the treatments with
germinated bean's soluble residues. Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens was
increased by the insoluble residues.
