Constipation is a common clinical manifestation of digestive system disorders and
occurs worldwide. This study investigated the ability of Lactobacillus plantarum 
KSFY06 (LP-KSFY06) to promote the action of geniposide in preventing
montmorillonite-induced constipation in Kunming mice, with the aim of providing a
successful solution. The effects of LP-KSFY06 and geniposide on constipation were
measured, and the results showed that the protective effect of geniposide on
constipation was enhanced by LP-KSFY06 and that the combination resulted in
increased weight, moisture content, and particle number of feces. The first black
stool defecation time was decreased from 182 min to 87 min, which clearly
indicates that defecating difficulty was alleviated in constipated mice. The
synergic intervention of LP-KSFY06 and geniposide (LP + G) assisted in
maintaining the body weight of constipated mice. The LP + G intervention
significantly increased serum levels of motilin (MTL, 167.8 pg/ml),
acetylcholinesterase (AChE, 45.3 pg/ml), substance P (SP, 61.0 pg/ml), vasoactive
intestinal peptide (VIP, 70.5 pg/ml), endothelin-1 (ET-1, 16.1 pg/ml), and
gastrin (73.0 pg/ml) and remarkably decreased somatostatin (SS, 35.2 pg/ml) when 
compared to those indexes in the LP-KSFY06 group and geniposide group. The LP + G
treatment also significantly increased the mRNA expression of cluster of
differentiation 117 (c-Kit), stem cell factor (SCF), glial cell-derived
neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and remarkably downregulated the expression of
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 
(TRPV1), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). The experimental results showed that the
combination treatment has the strongest prevention effect against constipation,
and LP-KSFY06 promotes the ability of geniposide to prevent constipation.
Therefore, LP-KSFY06 is a potential probiotic strain with the capacity to prevent
montmorillonite-induced constipation.
