The formation of biogenic amines (BAs) is an important potential risk in Suan yu.
This study investigated the amine production abilities of 97 strains of enteric
bacteria screened from Suan yu. The genotypic diversity of amino acid
decarboxylase and the effect of pH were explored on 27 strains of high-yield BAs.
Results showed that high levels of putrescine, histamine, and cadaverine were
produced by the 97 strains. In addition, 27 strains carried odc, speA, speB,
adiA, and ldc genes. Thirteen carried hdc gene. Morganella morganii 42C2 produced
the highest putrescine content of 880 mg/L via the ornithine decarboxylase
pathway. The highest histamine content was produced by Klebsiella aerogenes 13C2 
(1,869 mg/L). The highest cadaverine content was shown by Klebsiella pneumoniae
47C2 (1,821 mg/L). odc, adiA, speB, ldc, and hdc play important roles in the
cellular acid stress response. Acid stress caused the growth delay but can
increase the contents of putrescine, histamine, and cadaverine. Decarboxylase was
strain specific rather than species specific. This study provides a reference for
the genotypic diversity of decarboxylase and effect of pH on the types and
abilities of BAs produced by enteric bacteria in Suan yu.
