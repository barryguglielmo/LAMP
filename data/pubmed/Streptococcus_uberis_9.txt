The mode of action of bismuth subnitrate in teat sealant formulations as a
preventative for intramammary infections during the dry period is unknown.
Although previous studies proposed an action mechanism-creating a physical
barrier in the teat canal to prevent bacterial invasion-it has not been proven
experimentally. We hypothesized that bismuth subnitrate has an inhibitory effect 
on bacterial growth, in addition to its barrier effect. The objective of this
study was to assess the effect of bismuth subnitrate on bacterial growth of major
mastitis-causing agents. A strain of Streptococcus uberis (SR115), 2 strains of
Staphylococcus aureus (SA3971/59 and SA1), and a strain of Escherichia coli
(P17.14291) were tested in vitro for their ability to grow in the presence or
absence of bismuth subnitrate. Disk diffusion testing, impedance measurement, and
evaluation of bacterial growth in shaking conditions were the methods used to
test this hypothesis. A reduction of growth in the presence of bismuth subnitrate
occurred for all the strains tested. However, we observed strain and species
variations in the extent of growth inhibition. These results suggest that an
inhibitory effect on bacterial growth by bismuth subnitrate could partially
explain the efficacy of bismuth-based formulations for preventing intramammary
infections over the dry period. Further research is required to test the effect
of teat sealant formulations on bacterial growth.
