Lactic acid bacteria have been attracting increased attentions recent years
because of harboring probiotic properties. In present study, a Lactobacillus
pentosus strain ZFM94 was screened from healthy infant feces and its probiotic
characteristics were investigated. We found that ZFM94 was resistant to
environmental stresses (temperature, pH and NaCl), tolerant to gastrointestinal
juice and bile salts, with inhibitory action against pathogens and capacity of
folate production etc. Additionally, complete genome sequence of the strain was
analyzed to highlight the probiotic features at genetic level. Genomic
characteristics along with the experimental studies is critically important for
building an appropriate probiotic profile of novel strains. Genes that correspond
to phenotypes mentioned above were identified. Moreover, genes potentially
related to its adaptation, such as carbon metabolism and carbohydrate
transporter, carbohydrate-active enzymes, and a novel gene cluster RaS-RiPPs,
were also revealed. Together, ZFM94 could be considered as a potential probiotic 
candidate.
