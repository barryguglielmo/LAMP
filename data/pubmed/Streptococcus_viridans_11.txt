Brain abscess formation is extremely rare in patients with osteopetrosis. Herein,
we report a case of viridans streptococci brain abscess in an immunocompromised
child diagnosed with osteopetrosis. The patient presented with a sudden change in
mental status and convulsions. Radiological evaluation revealed a temporal lobe
brain abscess, and intravenous antibiotherapy was started immediately. The
patient underwent abscess drainage, and laboratory investigation of pus material 
revealed viridans streptococci.
