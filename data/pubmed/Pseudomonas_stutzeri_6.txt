Alginate is a group of water-soluble linear polysaccharides comprising of
variable units of α-l-guluronic and β-d-mannuronic acid. The alginates are in
high demand in biomedical, pharmaceutical and bioengineering applications. In the
present study, we have isolated a strain of Pseudomonas stutzeri that has
potential alginate synthesis. The biochemical and physiochemical characteristic
including Carbazole assay, DSC, FTIR and H NMR were confirmed the alginate
synthesis efficacy by P. stutzeri. Evaluation of P. stutzeri alginate for the
removal of heavy metals such as Chromium, Cobalt and Lead showed that it
effectively adsorbs heavy metals. Further analysis of gelling ability and
cytotoxicity evaluation revealed that the alginate can be reconstituted as
hydrogel and scaffold. Overall, our findings suggest that the strain P. stutzeri 
TN_Alg Syn may be used to produce alginate at commercial level that has the
potential bioremediation and biomedical applications.
