From ecological and industrial perspectives, Anoxybacillus flavithermus species
that lives in a thermophilic environment, are extremely important bacteria due to
their potential in producing highly interesting compounds and enzymes. In order
to understand the genetic makeup of these thermophiles, we have performed a
comparative genomics study of 12 genome-sequenced strains of Anoxybacillus
flavithermus bacteria. The genome size of Anoxybacillus flavithermus strains is
from 2.5Mbp to 3.7Mbp and on average containing a low percentage of G + C genomic
content (˜41.9%). We show that, on the basis of the total gene-content,
Anoxybacillus flavithermus strains are grouped in three different subgroups. In
the future, it would be interesting to explore these strain subgroups to further 
understand the lifestyle of thermophilic bacteria. Focussing on the Anoxybacillus
flavithermus AK1 strain, which was isolated from a Hot Spring in Saudi Arabia and
closely related to A. flavithermus NBRC strain, we identified a unique list of 75
genes specific to AK1 strain, of which 63 of them have homologs in other
taxonomically related species. We speculate that these AK1-specific genes might
be resulted due to horizontal gene transfer from other bacteria in order to adapt
to the extreme environmental conditions. Moreover, we predicted three potential
secondary metabolite gene clusters in the AK1 strain that further need to be
experimentally characterised. Genomic annotation, secondary metabolite gene
clusters and outcomes of the strain genomic comparisons from this study would be 
the basis for the strain-specific mathematical model for exploiting the
metabolism for the industrial and ecological applications.
