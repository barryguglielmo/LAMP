Understanding the honeybee gut bacteria is an essential aspect as honeybees are
the primary pollinators of many crops. In this study, the honeybee-associated gut
bacteria were investigated by targeting the V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA genes using 
the Illumina MiSeq. The adult worker was captured in an urban area in a dense
settlement. In total, 83,018 reads were obtained, revealing six phyla from 749
bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The gut was dominated by
Proteobacteria (58% of the total reads, including Enterobacteriaceae 28.2%,
Erwinia 6.43%, and Klebsiella 4.90%), Firmicutes (29% of the total reads,
including Lactococcus garvieae 13.45%, Lactobacillus spp. 8.19%, and Enterococcus
spp. 4.47%), and Actinobacteria (8% of the total reads, including Bifidobacterium
spp. 7.96%). Many of these bacteria belong to the group of lactic acid bacteria
(LAB), which was claimed to be composed of beneficial bacteria involved in
maintaining a healthy host. The honeybee was identified as Apis nigrocincta based
on an identity BLAST search of its COI region. This study is the first report on 
the gut microbial community structure and composition of A. nigrocincta from
Indonesia.
