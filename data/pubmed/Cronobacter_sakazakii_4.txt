The purpose of this study was to elucidate the antibacterial activity and
possible mechanism of action of Amaranthus tricolor crude extract (ATCE) against 
Cronobacter sakazakii isolated from powdered infant formula (PIF). The
antibacterial activity of ATCE was assessed by measuring the diameter of
inhibition zone (DIZ), minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and minimum
bactericidal concentration (MBC). The possible mechanism of action of ATCE was
revealed by analyzing the effects of ATCE on growth curves and changes in cell
membrane potential, intracellular pH, content of bacterial protein and genomic
DNA, and cell morphology. Finally, ATCE was applied to the disinfection of C.
sakazakii in biofilm on stainless steel tube. The results showed that the DIZ,
MIC, and MBC of ATCE against C. sakazakii strains were from 14.35 ± 0.67 to 14.84
± 0.67 mm, 20 mg/mL, and 40 mg/mL, respectively. Treatment with ATCE ended the
logarithmic growth phase of C. sakazakii, and led to depolarization of the cell
membranes, reducing intracellular pH and bacterial protein and genomic DNA
contents, and resulting in cytoplasmic leakage and deformation. In addition, ATCE
effectively inactivated C. sakazakii in biofilm, reducing viable bacteria by
approximately 6.5 log cfu/mL bacterial count after treatment with 1 MIC (1 MIC = 
20 mg/mL) of ATCE for 20 min at 25°C. Our findings showed that ATCE inactivated
C. sakazakii strains isolated from PIF and has potential as a natural
disinfectant to reduce the contamination of PIF by C. sakazakii.
