BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Based on the recent identification of E.coli heat shock
protein ClpB as a mimetic of the anorexigenic α-melanocyte stimulating hormone
(α-MSH), the objective of this study was to preclinically validate Hafnia alvei, 
a ClpB-producing commensal bacterium as a potential probiotic for appetite and
body weight management in overweight and obesity.
METHODS: The involvement of enterobacterial ClpB in the putative anti-obesity
effects was studied using ClpB-deficient E.coli. A food-grade H. alvei HA4597
strain synthetizing the ClpB protein with an α-MSH-like motif was selected as a
candidate probiotic to be tested in ob/ob and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed obese and
overweight mice. The relevance of the enterobacterial ClpB gene to human obesity 
was studied by in silico analysis of fecal metagenomes of 569 healthy individuals
from the "MetaHIT" database.
RESULTS: Chronic per os administration of native but not ClpB-deficient E.coli
strain reduced body weight gain (p < 0.05) and daily meal frequency (p < 0.001)
in ob/ob mice. Oral gavage of H.alvei for 18 and 46 days in ob/ob and HFD-fed
obese mice, respectively, was well tolerated, reduced body weight gain and fat
mass in both obesity models (p < 0.05) and decreased food intake in hyperphagic
ob/ob mice (p < 0.001). Elevated fat tissue levels of phosphorylated
hormone-sensitive lipase were detected in H.alvei -treated ob/ob mice (p < 0.01).
Enterobacterial ClpB gene richness was lower in obese vs. non-obese humans
(p < 0.0001) and correlated negatively with BMI in genera of Enterobacter,
Klebsiella and Hafnia.
CONCLUSIONS: H.alvei HA4597 strain reduces food intake, body weight and fat mass 
gain in hyperphagic and obese mice. These data combined with low enterobacterial 
ClpB gene abundance in the microbiota of obese humans provide the rationale for
using H.alvei as a probiotic for appetite and body weight management in
overweight and obesity.
