Multidrug-resistant bacteria are among the most important current threats to
public health. Typically, they are associated with nosocomial infections.
However, some have become prevalent causes of community-acquired infections, such
as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Shigella, Salmonella, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The
community spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria is also a crucial development.
An important global threat on the horizon is represented by production of
carbapenemases by community-acquired hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae. Such
strains have already been found in Asia, Europe, and North America. Prevention of
further community spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria is of the utmost
importance, and will require a multidisciplinary approach involving all
stakeholders.
