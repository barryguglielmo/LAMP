The incorporation of highly active but also highly sensitive catalysts (e.g. the 
[FeFe] hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans) in biofuel cells is still
one of the major challenges in sustainable energy conversion. We report the
fabrication of a dual-gas diffusion electrode H2 /O2 biofuel cell equipped with a
[FeFe] hydrogenase/redox polymer-based high-current-density H2 -oxidation
bioanode. The bioanodes show benchmark current densities of around 14 mA cm-2 and
the corresponding fuel cell tests exhibit a benchmark for a hydrogenase/redox
polymer-based biofuel cell with outstanding power densities of 5.4 mW cm-2 at
0.7 V cell voltage. Furthermore, the highly sensitive [FeFe] hydrogenase is
protected against oxygen damage by the redox polymer and can function under 5 %
O2 .
