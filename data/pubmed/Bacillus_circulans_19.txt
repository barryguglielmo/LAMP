Bacillus circulans 528 produces a restriction endonuclease, Bci528I which is an
isoschizomer of EcoRI. We purified the enzyme, using Sephadex G-150,
Phospho-cellulose, DEAE-cellulose, Hepharin-Sepharose CL-6B chromatography. The
specific activity of Bci528I was 29,400 U/mg·protein. Bci528I recognizes
5'-GAATTC-3' in dsDNA and cleaves between G and A of the recognition sequence,
producing a symmetric four base 5'overhang.
