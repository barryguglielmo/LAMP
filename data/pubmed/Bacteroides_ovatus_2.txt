An increasing body of evidence suggests that gut microbiota is involved in atopic
dermatitis (AD). We aimed to use high-throughput sequencing to characterize the
differences in the composition of the gut microbiota between healthy controls and
patients with AD. Fecal samples from 93 volunteers were analyzed using 16S rRNA
sequencing, including 44 patients with AD and 49 healthy control subjects, aged
6-22 years. Our data show that the operational taxonomic unit composition in
patients with AD had greater component similarity than the healthy controls.
Patients with AD had a lower alpha diversity than healthy control subjects. The
relative abundance of Porphyromonadaceae, Blautia, Parabacteroides, Bacteroides
ovatus, Bacteroides uniformis and Prevotella stercorea was significantly higher
(P < 0.05) in patients with AD than healthy control subjects. Clostridium and
P. stercorea were higher (P < 0.05) in healthy control subjects compared with
patients with AD. The results of linear discriminant analysis effect size show
that Bacteroidaceae and Porphyromonadaceae can act as possible biomarkers
associated with diagnosis of AD. However, this needs further experimental
verification. Taken together, these results demonstrate the changes in microbiota
composition in AD compared with a healthy control group, opening the way to
future diagnosis or intervention studies.
