BACKGROUND: Marine macroalgae Gelidium amansii is a promising feedstock for
production of sustainable biochemicals to replace petroleum and edible biomass.
Different from terrestrial lignocellulosic biomass, G. amansii is comprised of
high carbohydrate content and has no lignin. In previous studies, G. amansii
biomass has been exploited to obtain fermentable sugars along with suppressing
5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) formation for bioethanol production. In this study,
a different strategy was addressed and verified for dual production of
D-galactose and HMF, which were subsequently oxidized to D-galactonic acid and
5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) respectively via Pseudomonas
putida.
RESULTS: G. amansii biomass was hydrolyzed by dilute acid to form D-galactose and
HMF. The best result was attained after pretreatment with 2% (w/w) HCl at 120 °C 
for 40 min. Five different Pseudomonas sp. strains including P. putida ATCC
47054, P. fragi ATCC 4973, P. stutzeri CICC 10402, P. rhodesiae CICC 21960, and
P. aeruginosa CGMCC 1.10712, were screened for highly selective oxidation of
D-galactose and HMF. Among them, P. putida ATCC 47054 was the outstanding
suitable biocatalyst converting D-galactose and HMF to the corresponding acids
without reduced or over-oxidized products. It was plausible that the
pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent glucose dehydrogenase and undiscovered
molybdate-dependent enzyme(s) in P. putida ATCC 47054 individually played pivotal
role for D-galactose and HMF oxidation. Taking advantage of its excellent
efficiency and high selectivity, a maximum of 55.30 g/L D-galactonic acid and
11.09 g/L HMFCA were obtained with yields of 91.1% and 98.7% using G. amansii
hydrolysates as substrate.
CONCLUSIONS: Valorization of G. amansii biomass for dual production of
D-galactonic acid and HMFCA can enrich the product varieties and improve the
economic benefits. This study also demonstrates the perspective of making full
use of marine feedstocks to produce other value-added products.
