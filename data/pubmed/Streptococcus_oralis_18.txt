BACKGROUND: Viridans group streptococci of the Streptococcus mitis-oralis
subgroup are important endovascular pathogens. They can rapidly develop
high-level and durable non-susceptibility to daptomycin both in vitro and in vivo
upon exposure to daptomycin. Two consistent genetic adaptations associated with
this phenotype (i.e., mutations in cdsA and pgsA) lead to the depletion of the
phospholipids, phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin, from the bacterial membrane.
Such alterations in phospholipid biosynthesis will modify carbon flow and change 
the bacterial metabolic status. To determine the metabolic differences between
daptomycin-susceptible and non-susceptible bacteria, the physiology and
metabolomes of S. mitis-oralis strains 351 (daptomycin-susceptible) and 351-D10
(daptomycin non-susceptible) were analyzed. S. mitis-oralis strain 351-D10 was
made daptomycin non-susceptible through serial passage in the presence of
daptomycin.
RESULTS: Daptomycin non-susceptible S. mitis-oralis had significant alterations
in glucose catabolism and a re-balancing of the redox status through amino acid
biosynthesis relative to daptomycin susceptible S. mitis-oralis. These changes
were accompanied by a reduced capacity to generate biomass, creating a fitness
cost in exchange for daptomycin non-susceptibility.
CONCLUSIONS: S. mitis-oralis metabolism is altered in daptomycin non-susceptible 
bacteria relative to the daptomycin susceptible parent strain. As demonstrated in
Staphylococcus aureus, inhibiting the metabolic changes that facilitate the
transition from a daptomycin susceptible state to a non-susceptible one, inhibits
daptomycin non-susceptibility. By preventing these metabolic adaptations in S.
mitis-oralis, it should be possible to deter the formation of daptomycin
non-susceptibility.
