Background: Given high rates of positive Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes) cultures 
in cases of both primary and revision shoulder surgery, the ramifications of
positive C. acnes cultures remain uncertain. Next generation sequencing (NGS) is 
a molecular tool that sequences the whole bacterial genome and is capable of
identifying pathogens and the relative percent abundance in which they appear
within a sample. The purpose of this study was to report the false positive
culture rate in negative control specimens and to determine whether NGS has
potential value in reducing the rate of false positive results.
Methods: Between April 2017 and May 2017 swabs were taken during primary shoulder
arthroplasty. After surgical time out, using sterile gloves, a sterile swab was
opened and exposed to the air for 5 seconds, returned to its contained, and
sealed. One swab was sent to our institution's microbiology laboratory for
aerobic and anaerobic culture and held for 13 days. The other sample was sent for
NGS (MicroGen Dx, Lubbock, TX), where samples were amplified for pyrosequencing
using a forward and reverse fusion primer and matched against a DNA library for
species identification.
Results: For 40 consecutive cases, swabs were sent for culture and NGS. C. acnes 
was identified by culture in 6/40 (15%) swabs and coagulase negative
staphylococcus (CNS) was identified in 3/40 (7.5%). Both cases with positive NGS 
sequencing reported polymicrobial results with one sample (2.5%), including a
relative abundance of 3% C. acnes. At 90 days after surgery, there were no cases 
of clinical infection in any of the 40 cases.
Conclusion: We demonstrate that the two most commonly cultured organisms (C.
acnes and CNS) during revision shoulder arthroplasty are also the two most
commonly cultured organisms from negative control specimens. Contamination can
come from air in the operating room or laboratory contamination.
