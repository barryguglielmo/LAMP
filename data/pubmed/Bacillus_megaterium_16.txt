This work investigates the transport behaviour of selected organophosphorus
pesticides, OPPs (chlorpyrifos, CP; chlorpyrifos-methyl, CPM; chlorfenvinphos,
CF) through Danube alluvial sediment in the presence of hydrochars and biochars. 
The investigated hydrochar, obtained at three different temperatures (180 °C, 200
°Cand 220 °C), originated from sugar beet shreds (SBS) and Miscanthus×giganteus
(MIS). Results are described by conventional advective-dispersive equation (ADE).
Retardation coefficients (Rd) for all OPPs were in the range 6.2-16.
Biodegradation was 4.15 and 1.80 for CPM and CP, respectively, while for CF
biodegradation did not occur. The addition of carbon rich materials increases
retardation of all OPPs in the range from 4 to 18 times depending on the
material. Column experiment results indicated that biodegradation of OPPs
occurred (up to λ = 13). In order to confirm that biodegradation occurred in the 
column experiments, we isolated OPPs degrading microorganisms for the first time 
from the alluvial sediment. A strain capable of degrading CP and CPM was isolated
and identified as Bacillus megaterium BD5 based on biochemical properties, MALDI 
TOF and 16S rRNA analysis (99.54% identity). The results demonstrate that
hydrochars, biochars and isolated degrading bacteria may be effective agents for 
reducing the mobility of or removing OPPs in contaminated soils or sediments.
