OBJECTIVE: Although organic-inorganic hybrid nanoflowers (hNFs) with much
enhanced catalytic activity and stability were fabricated using proteins and
enzymes, in this study, for the first time, we report synthesis of allicin and
copper ion (Cu2+) coordinated NFs and investigate their peroxidase-like and
antimicrobial activities.
RESULTS: The allicin (active ingredient of Allium sativum) and Cu2+ was acted as 
an organic and inorganic part, respectively for synthesis of the Cu-hNFs. The
hNFs were characterized by various techniques. Spherical, uniform, mono-dispersed
and flower-like-shaped morphology of the hNFs (synthesized at pH 5) were imaged
by scanning electron microscopy. The presence of Cu metal in the hNFs was
detected by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Characteristic bonds stretching
and bending for structural analysis of the hNFs were carried out by Fourier
transform infrared spectrometry. In terms of applications, the hNFs showed quite 
effective peroxidase-like activity towards to guaiacol (used as a model
substrate) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through Fenton reaction.
We demonstrated that the NFs exhibited ~ 200% and ~ 500% higher catalytic
activities in 1 h (hr) and 3 h (hrs) than their initial catalytic activity
measured in 5 minute (min). Additionally, effective antibacterial properties of
the Cu-hNFs were observed against fish pathogen bacteria (Aeromonas hydrophila,
Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Lactococcus garvieae).
CONCLUSIONS: We finally demonsrated that allicin based hybrid nanomaterial can be
prepared by a relatively cheap, one step, easy and eco-friendly method. The
allicin hNFs can be considered as novel Fenton agent for peroxidase like activity
and bactericidal.
