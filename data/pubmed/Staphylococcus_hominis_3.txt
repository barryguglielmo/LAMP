Bacteria causing diabetic foot infections (DFI) are chronic and generally
multidrug resistant (MDR), which calls urgently for alternative antibacterials.
The present study focused on potential metabolite producing bacteria from a
saltpan environment and screened against MDR pathogens isolated from DFI
patients. Molecular identification of the DFI pathogens provided Klebsiella
quasivariicola, Staphylococcus argenteus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus
hominis subsp. novobiosepticus, Bacillus australimaris, and Corynebacterium
stationis. Among 34 isolated halophilic bacteria, the cell-free supernatant of
strain PSH06 provided the largest inhibition zone of 23 mm against K.
quasivariicola [D1], 21 mm against. S. argenteus [D2], 19 mm against E. coli
[D3], and a minimum inhibition zone was found to be 14 mm against C. stationis
[D8]. The potent activity providing stain confirmed as Pseudomonas aeruginosa
through molecular identification. On the other hand, ethyl acetate extract of
this strain showed excellent growth inhibition in MIC at 64 µg/mL against K.
quasivariicola. Distressed cell membranes and vast dead cells were observed at
MIC of ethyl acetate extract by SEM and CLSM against K.quasivariicola and E.
coli. GC-MS profile of ethyl acetate extract exposed the occurrence of Bis
(2-Ethylhexyl) Phthalate and n-Hexadecanoic acid and shows 100% toxic effect at
24 mg/mL by Artemia nauplii. The active extract fraction with above compounds
derived from saltpan bacteria provided highest antibacterial efficacy against
DFI-associated pathogens depicted with broad spectrum activity compared to
standard antibiotics.
