Paratuberculosis is an infectious disease of ruminants caused by Mycobacterium
avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). MAP is an intracellular pathogen with a
possible zoonotic potential since it has been successfully isolated from the
intestine and blood of Crohn's disease patients.Since no cure is available, after
the detection of the disease, animal culling is the sole applicable containment
strategy. However, the difficult detection of the disease in its subclinical
form, facilitates its spread raising the need for the development of effective
diagnosis and vaccination strategies. The prompt identification and isolation of 
the infected animals in the subclinical stage would prevent the spread of the
infection.In the present study, an immunoinformatic approach has been used to
investigate the immunogenic properties of 10 MAP proteins. These proteins were
chosen according to a previously published immunoproteomics approach. For each
previously-described immunoreactive protein, we predicted the epitopes capable of
eliciting an immune response by binding both B-cells and/or class I MHC antigens.
The retrieved peptide sequences were analyzed for their specificity and
cross-reactivity. The final aim is to employ the discovered peptides sequences as
a filtered library useful for early-stage diagnosis and/or to be used in novel
multi-subunit or recombinant vaccine formulations.
