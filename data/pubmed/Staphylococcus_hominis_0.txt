This study was performed to isolate non-rhizobial endophytic bacteria from the
root nodules of Glycine max (soybean), Vigna radiata (mung bean) and Vigna
unguiculata (cowpea). The bacteria were characterized for plant growth promoting 
properties such as indole acetic acid production, phosphate and zinc
solubilisation, nitrogen fixation and hydrogen cyanide production. Phylogenetic
identification was performed using the Neighbour-Joining method on16S rRNA gene
sequences. The impact of salt tolerant isolates on some properties of wheat cv.
Chamran was evaluated by a completely randomised factorial design. Nine isolates 
having some characteristics related to plant growth promotion were identified as 
Staphylococcus hominis 7E, Streptomyces sp. 11E, Bacillus sp. 13E, Acinetobacter 
sp. 19E, from mung bean, Bacillus endophyticus 1E from cowpea, Staphylococcus
hominis 9E, Bacillus endophyticus 14E, Brevundimonas sp. 16E and Kocuria sp. 26E 
from soybean nodules. Isolates 7E and 19E caused maximum growth inhibition of
Fusarium on PDA plate. All isolates were able to grow at salinity levels of
mixtures containing up to 400 mM of NaCl, CaCl2 and MgCl2, but their growth was
inhibited by increasing salinity level. Only the growth of isolate 14E increased 
at three levels of salinity compared with control. Some isolates, i.e. 7E, 14E,
19E and 26E had higher colony diameter at 45 °C after 48 h of incubation compared
to the growth at 30 and 40 °C. Inoculation of soil with isolate 1E and isolate
26E caused to ameliorate salinity stress in wheat and increased the weight of
1000-grains as compared with non-inoculated treatments.
