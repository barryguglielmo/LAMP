An 86-year-old woman was admitted for the investigation of atelectasis of the
upper lobe of her right lung with a mass shadow in the hilum (Golden S sign).
Chest computed tomography revealed swollen connective tissue around the right
bronchus, and needle aspirate grew Bifidobacterium longum and Veillonella
species. She was diagnosed with peribronchial connective tissue infection, and
her condition improved with antibiotics. Although this sign is strongly
suggestive of malignant disease, benign disease should be considered in the
differential diagnosis. Pulmonary infection caused by Bifidobacterium longum is
extremely rare; however, clinicians should consider it as a possible cause of
pulmonary infections.
