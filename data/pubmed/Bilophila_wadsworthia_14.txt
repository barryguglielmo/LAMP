RATIONALE: Although a growing body of evidence indicates that the scores of
cognitive function in hemodialysis patients are significantly lower than those of
healthy individuals, underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the roles of gut microbiota and serum metabolites in
hemodialysis patients with mild cognitive decline (MCD).
METHODS: A total of 30 healthy individuals and 77 hemodialysis patients were
enrolled and were classified into healthy control (HC), normal cognitive function
(NCF), and MCD groups by evaluation of Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Fecal
samples were analyzed by 16S rRNA and serum samples were analyzed by gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry from all subjects.
RESULTS: The 16S rRNA study demonstrated that the gut microbiota profiles,
including α- and β-diversity, and a number of 16 gut bacteria were significantly 
altered in the MCD group compared with those in HC or those with NCF. A
metabonomics study showed that a total of 29 serum metabolites were altered in
the MCD group. Receiver operating characteristic curves showed that Genus
Bilophila and serum putrescine might be sensitive biomarkers to indicate MCD in
patients with hemodialysis.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate gut microbiota and serum metabolites were
probably involved in the pathogenesis of hemodialysis-related MCD. Therapeutic
strategies targeting abnormalities in gut microbiota and serum metabolites may
facilitate the beneficial effects for hemodialysis patients with MCD.
