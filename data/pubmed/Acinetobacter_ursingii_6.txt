BACKGROUND AND AIM: Nowadays, anti-inflammation treatment is a promising approach
for preventing tumorigenesis, and human microflora is closely related to
inflammation. This study aimed to investigate the gastric cardiac microbiome and 
identify inflammation-related microorganisms for gastric cardiac inflammation.
METHODS: We performed 16S rRNA sequencing on a total of 11 healthy individuals
and 89 individuals with different degree of gastric cardiac inflammation.
Immunohistochemistry was used for verifying candidate bacteria. Phylogenetic
reconstruction of unobserved states (picrust) was used for predicting the
pathways involved by cardiac microflora.
RESULTS: The resident phyla in normal were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes,
Bacteroides, and Actinobacteria, and the dominant genus in normal were Halomonas,
shewanella, and Comamonas. In the progression of gastric cardiac inflammation,
the diversity of cardiac microflora did not change (P > 0.05). However, the
composition structure of cardiac microflora varied between healthy and inflamed
tissues (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, there were 64 species parallel increased with
inflammation degree, especially Helicobacter pylori, Lactobacillus spp.
Additionally, inflammation-related species were detected (P < 0.05), including H.
pylori, Acinetobacter ursingii, and Streptococcus agalactiae. Higher H. pylori
colonization was positively related to the progression of cardiac inflammation (γ
coefficient = 0.678, P < 0.001), and it also influenced the cardiac microbial
community structure. Cardiac microflora also participated in DNA repair pathways 
and is affected by the relative abundance of H. pylori (P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac microflora dysbiosis, especially the increasing of the
relevant abundance of H. pylori, promotes the progression of cardiac
inflammation.
