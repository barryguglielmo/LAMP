Recent studies have shown that the metal adaptation of Actinobacteria offers a
rich source of metal inducible environmentally relevant bio-compounds and
molecules. These interact through biosorption towards the unique cell walls or
via metal chelating activity of metallophors with trace elements, heavy metals
and even with lanthanides to overcome limitations and toxic concentrations.
Herein, the purpose is to investigate the adaptation potential of Gordonia
rubripertincta CWB2 in dependence of the rare earths and to determine if we can
utilize promising metallophore metal affinities for metal separation from aquatic
solutions. For details on data interpretation and applicability of siderophores
we refer to the related article entitled "Cultivation dependent formation of
siderophores by Gordonia rubripertincta CWB2" [1]. The respective workflow
comprises a metal adaptation method to demonstrate effects on bacterial growth,
pH, metallophore production, and metabolic change. All this was evaluated by
LC-MS/MS and effects on biosorption of rare earths was verified by ICP-MS.
Furthermore, we were able to carry out batch metal adsorption and desorption
studies of metallophores entrapped in inorganic polymers of tetramethoxysilane
(TMOS) to determine metal chelating capacities and selective enrichment effects
from model solutions. The adaptation potential of strain CWB2 at increased erbium
and manganese concentrations was verified by increased chelating activity on agar
plates, in liquid assays and demonstrated by the successful enrichment of erbium 
by metallophore-functionalized TMOS-polymers from an aquatic model solution.
Furthermore, the number of detected compounds in dependency of rare earths differ
in spectral counts and diversity compared to the wild type. Finally, the
biosorption of rare earths for the selected adaptation was increased
significantly up to 2-fold compared to the wild-type. Overall a holistic approach
to metal stress was utilised, integrating a bacterial erbium adaptation, metal
chelating, biosorption of lanthanides and immobilization as well as enrichment of
metals using metallophore functionalized inorganic TMOS polymers for separation
of metals from aquatic model solutions.
