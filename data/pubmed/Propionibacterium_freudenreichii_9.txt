Propionibacterium freudenreichii is a beneficial bacterium widely used in food as
a probiotic and as a cheese-ripening starter. In these different applications, it
is produced, dried, and stored before being used. Both freeze-drying and
spray-drying were considered for this purpose. Freeze-drying is a discontinuous
process that is energy-consuming but that allows high cell survival. Spray-drying
is a continuous process that is more energy-efficient but that can lead to
massive bacterial death related to heat, osmotic, and oxidative stresses. We have
shown that P. freudenreichii cultivated in hyperconcentrated rich media can be
spray-dried with limited bacterial death. However, the general stress tolerance
conferred by this hyperosmotic constraint remained a black box. In this study, we
modulated P. freudenreichii growth conditions and monitored both osmoprotectant
accumulation and stress tolerance acquisition. Changing the ratio between the
carbohydrates provided and non-protein nitrogen during growth under osmotic
constraint modulated osmoprotectant accumulation. This, in turn, was correlated
with P. freudenreichii tolerance towards different stresses, on the one hand, and
towards freeze-drying and spray-drying, on the other. Surprisingly, trehalose
accumulation correlated with spray-drying survival and glycine betaine
accumulation with freeze-drying. This first report showing the ability to
modulate the trehalose/GB ratio in osmoprotectants accumulated by a probiotic
bacterium opens new perspectives for the optimization of probiotics production.
