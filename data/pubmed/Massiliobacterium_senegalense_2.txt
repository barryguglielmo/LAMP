We report the draft genome sequence of a new Clostridium senegalense strain,
AGRFS4, which was isolated from a dairy farm environment in the Manawatu region
in New Zealand. The genome is 3.98 Mb, with a GC content of 27%. The genome
sequence was found to be 86.6% similar to that of the type strain Clostridium
senegalense JC122. Until now, no Clostridium senegalense strain from New Zealand 
has been reported.
