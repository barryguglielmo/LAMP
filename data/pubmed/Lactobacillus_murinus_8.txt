Late-onset sepsis (LOS) is thought to result from systemic spread of commensal
microbes from the intestines of premature infants. Clinical use of probiotics for
LOS prophylaxis has varied owing to limited efficacy, reflecting an incomplete
understanding of relationships between development of the intestinal microbiome, 
neonatal dysbiosis and LOS. Using a model of LOS, we found that components of the
developing microbiome were both necessary and sufficient to prevent LOS. Maternal
antibiotic exposure that eradicated or enriched transmission of Lactobacillus
murinus exacerbated and prevented disease, respectively. Prophylactic
administration of some, but not all Lactobacillus spp. was protective, as was
administration of Escherichia coli. Intestinal oxygen level was a major driver of
colonization dynamics, albeit via mechanisms distinct from those in adults. These
results establish a link between neonatal dysbiosis and LOS, and provide a basis 
for rational selection of probiotics that modulate primary succession of the
microbiome to prevent disease.
