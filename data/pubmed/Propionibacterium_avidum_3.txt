Imbalance in skin microflora, particularly related to certain Cutibacterium acnes
strains, may trigger acne. Application of non-acne-causing strains to the skin
may modulate the skin microbiome and thereby lead to a reduction in acne. This
pilot study evaluates the safety and efficacy of microbiome modulation on
acne-prone skin. The study had 2 phases: active induction (5% benzoyl peroxide
gel, 7 days) and interventional C. acnes strains treatment (5 weeks). Patients
were randomized to either topical skin formulations PT1 (2 strains of C. acnes
Single Locus Sequence Typing [SLST] type C3 and K8, 50% each) or PT2 (4 strains
of C. acnes SLST type C3 [55%], K8 [5%], A5 [30%] and F4 [10%]). Safety and
efficacy was evaluated in 14 patients (PT1=8/14, PT2=6/14). Skin microbiome
composition shifted towards study formulations. No untoward adverse events,
visible irritation, or significant flare-up were observed. Non-inflamed lesions
and skin pH were reduced. Comedone counts improved clinically with no
deterioration in inflammatory lesions.
