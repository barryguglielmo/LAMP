BACKGROUND: Common bean and cowpea contain about 25% protein and 25% fiber, and
are recommended as complementary foods in sub-Saharan Africa.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine if a daily legume
supplement given to Malawian infants aged 6 to 12 mo alters the 16S configuration
of the fecal microbiota as read out by amplicon sequence variants (ASVs).
METHODS: This study was conducted within the context of a randomized,
double-blind, controlled clinical trial to assess whether cowpea or common bean
supplementation reduced intestinal permeability or increased linear growth. There
were 2 village clusters in which the study was conducted. Fresh stool collections
were flash frozen from 236 infants at ≤6 time points. The stools were sequenced
using Earth Microbiome project protocols and data were processed using Qiime and 
Qiita, open-source, validated software packages. α-diversity was measured using
the Faith's test. The 16S configuration was characterized by determining the
weighted UniFrac distances of the ASVs and comparing them using permutational
multivariate ANOVA.
RESULTS: Among the 1249 samples analyzed, the α-diversity of the fecal microbiome
was unchanged among subjects after initiation of legume supplementation. Neither 
cowpea nor common bean altered the overall 16S configuration at any age. The 16S 
configuration differed between children with adequate and poor linear growth aged
from 6 to 9 mo, but no specific ASVs differed in relative abundance. The 16S
configuration differed between children with normal and abnormal intestinal
permeability at 9 mo, but no specific ASVs differed in relative abundance. Among 
categorical characteristics of the population associated with different 16S
configurations, village cluster was most pronounced.
CONCLUSION: Legume supplementation in breastfed, rural African infants did not
affect the structure of the gut microbial communities until the children were
aged 9 mo. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02472262.
