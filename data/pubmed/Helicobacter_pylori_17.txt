BACKGROUND: Endoscopic Kyoto classification predicts gastric cancer risk;
however, the score in the patients with primary gastric cancer after Helicobacter
pylori (H. pylori) eradication therapy is unknown.
AIM: To elucidate the Kyoto classification score in patients with both single
gastric cancer and multiple gastric cancers developed after H. pylori
eradication.
METHODS: The endoscopist recorded the Kyoto classification at the endoscope and
the Kyoto classification score at the time of the first diagnosis of gastric
cancer after H. pylori eradication. The score was compared between single gastric
cancer group and multiple gastric cancers group.
RESULTS: The Kyoto score at the time of diagnosis of 45 cases of gastric cancer
after H. pylori eradication was 4.0 points in average. The score was 3.8 points
in the single gastric cancer group, and 5.1 points in the multiple gastric
cancers group. The multiple group had a significantly higher score than the
single group (P = 0.016). In the multiple gastric cancers group, all the patients
(7/7) had 5 or higher Kyoto score, while in single gastric cancer group, the
proportion of patients with a score of 5 or higher was less than half, or 44.7%
(17/38).
CONCLUSION: Patients diagnosed with gastric cancer after H. pylori eradication
tended to have advanced gastritis. In particular, in cases of multiple gastric
cancers developed after H. pylori eradication, the endoscopic Kyoto
classification score tended to be 5 or higher in patients with an open type
atrophic gastritis and the intestinal metaplasia extended to the corpus.
