Two new ergostane-type steroids named tiamenones A and B (1-2) were isolated from
the bark of Entandrophragma angolense (Meliaceae) along with ten known compounds 
identified as 20S-hydroxy-4,6,24(28)-ergostatrien-3-one (3),
3β,7α,20β-trihydroxyergosta-5,24(28)-diene (4), 3β,5α-dihydroxyergosta-7,22-diene
(5), stigmasterol, β-sitosterol, β-amyrin, oleanolic acid, asperphenamate,
sucrose and daucosterol. The structures of the isolated compounds have been
established using NMR spectroscopic and mass spectrometric analyses. The
assignment of relative and absolute configurations of compound 1 was achieved by 
a NOESY experiment and comparison of its NMR data with those of known compound
reported in literature. Compounds 1-3, β-amyrin and asperphenamate were evaluated
for their antibacterial potencies against five bacterial model strains viz.
Escherichia coli DSMZ 1058, Pseudomonas agarici DSMZ 11810, Bacillus subtilis
DSMZ 704, Micrococcus luteus DMSZ 1605 and Staphylococcus warneri DSMZ 20036 and 
their cytotoxicity on two cell lines KB3-1 and HT-29. No potencies were exhibited
by the tested compounds even at the highest concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. Compounds
1-3 were found to be potential HIV-1 inhibitors based on their molecular docking 
analyses.
