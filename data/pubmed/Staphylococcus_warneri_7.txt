A 59-year-old man with type 1 diabetes presented with heart failure.
Echocardiography showed large vegetations on the mitral and aortic valves. Blood 
bacterial culture was positive for Staphylococcus warneri, a coagulase-negative
staphylococcus (CoNS) family member. He was diagnosed with native valve
endocarditis (NVE) induced by the resident bacteria and ultimately underwent
double valve replacement. Retrospectively, slight laboratory data abnormalities
and weight loss beginning four months before may have been signs of NVE. He had
no history of immunosuppressive therapies or medical device implantation. Thus,
CoNS can cause NVE after a long asymptomatic course in patients with poorly
controlled diabetes.
