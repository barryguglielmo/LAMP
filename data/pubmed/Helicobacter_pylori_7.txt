Many bacterial pathogens regulate their virulence genes via phase variation,
whereby length-variable simple sequence repeats control the transcription or
coding potential of those genes. Here, we have exploited this relationship
between DNA structure and physiological function to discover a globally acting
small RNA (sRNA) regulator of virulence in the gastric pathogen Helicobacter
pylori. Our study reports the first sRNA whose expression is affected by a
variable thymine (T) stretch in its promoter. We show the sRNA
post-transcriptionally represses multiple major pathogenicity factors of
H. pylori, including CagA and VacA, by base pairing to their mRNAs. We further
demonstrate transcription of the sRNA is regulated by the nickel-responsive
transcriptional regulator NikR (thus named NikS for nickel-regulated sRNA),
thereby linking virulence factor regulation to nickel concentrations. Using
in-vitro infection experiments, we demonstrate NikS affects host cell
internalization and epithelial barrier disruption. Together, our results show
NikS is a phase-variable, post-transcriptional global regulator of virulence
properties in H. pylori.
