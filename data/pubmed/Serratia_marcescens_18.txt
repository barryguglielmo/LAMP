Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a promising cellular identification
and drug susceptibility testing platform, provided it can be performed in a
controlled liquid environment that maintains cell viability. We investigate
bacterial liquid-SERS, studying plasmonic and electrostatic interactions between 
gold nanorods and bacteria that enable uniformly-enhanced SERS. We synthesize
five nanorod sizes with longitudinal plasmon resonances ranging from 670-860 nm
and characterize SERS signatures of Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Serratia
marcescens, and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus
epidermidis bacteria in water. Varying the concentration of bacteria and
nanorods, we achieve large-area SERS enhancement that is independent of nanorod
resonance and bacteria type; however, bacteria with higher surface charge density
exhibit significantly higher SERS signal. Using cryo-electron microscopy and zeta
potential measurements, we show that higher signal results from attraction
between positively-charged nanorods and negatively-charged bacteria. Our robust
liquid-SERS measurements provide a foundation for bacterial identification and
drug testing in biological fluids.
