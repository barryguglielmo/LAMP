The biodiversity of wheat associated bacteria was deciphered from the peninsular 
zone of India. A total of 264 isolated bacteria were analyzed through amplified
ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA, using three restriction enzymes Alu I,
Msp I and Hae III, which led to the clustering of these isolates into 12-16
groups for the different sites at >75% similarity index, adding up to 70 groups).
16S rRNA gene based phylogenetic analysis, revealed that all the bacteria
belonged to three phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria of 32
distinct species of 15 genera namely: Achromobacter, Alcaligenes, Arthrobacter,
Bacillus, Delftia, Enterobacter, Exiguobacterium, Klebsiella, Methylobacterium,
Micrococcus, Paenibacillus, Pseudomonas, Rhodobacter, Salmonella and
Staphylococcus. Representative strains from each cluster were screened in vitro
for plant growth promoting traits. Among plant growth promoting activities,
siderophore producers were highest (15%), when compared to indole acetic acid
producers (13%), Zn-solubilizers (11%), P-solubilizers (11%), ammonia (10%),
hydrogen cyanide producers (9%), biocontrol (8%), N2-fixers (7%),
1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (6%), GA producers (6%) and
K-solubilizers (5%). Among 32 representative strains, Alcaligenes faecalis,
Arthrobacter sp., Bacillus siamensis, Bacillus subtilis, Delftia acidovorans,
Methylobacterium mesophilicum, Methylobacterium sp., Pseudomonas poae,
Pseudomonas putida, and Pseudomonas stutzeri exhibited more than six different
plant growth promoting activities at high temperature. Thermotolerant bacterial
isolates may have application as inoculants for plant growth promotion and
biocontrol agents for crops growing at high temperature conditions.
