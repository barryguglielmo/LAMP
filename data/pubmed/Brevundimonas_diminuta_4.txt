Silver nanoparticles are potent antimicrobials and could be used as a promising
alternative of conventional antibiotics. The aim of this study was to isolate
bacteria from soil that have ability to produce AgNPs by secondary metabolite
activity and their elucidation against human pathogens. These strains Escherichia
coli, Exiguobacterium aurantiacumm, and Brevundimonas diminuta with NCBI
accession number MF754138, MF754139, and MF754140 respectively were grown for
secondary metabolite production. The nanoparticles were confirmed and
characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The
optimization study was also carried out to obtain the maximum production of
silver nanoparticles. Three parameters, temperature, pH, and AgNO3 concentration,
were used to optimize the production of silver nanoparticles. Antimicrobial
potential of these nanoparticles was addressed on the Muller-Hinton Agar, and
their zones of inhibitions were measured. TEM analysis revealed the size and
shape of the silver nanoparticles. All types of AgNPs were spherical in shape;
their size range is from 5 to 50 nm. The findings of optimization study showed
the maximum production of silver nanoparticles at the pH 9, temperature 37 °C,
and 1 mM AgNO3 concentration. All the strains exhibited the great potential as
antimicrobial agents against MRSA and several other MDR bacteria with minimum
10 mm to maximum 28 mm zone of inhibition. It was concluded that the present
study is an eco-friendly approach for the synthesis of AgNPs that will be
beneficial to control the nosocomial infections triggered by MRSA and other human
pathogens.
