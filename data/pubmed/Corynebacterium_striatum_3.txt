Uncommon lipids in biotechnologically important Corynebacterium glutamicum and
pathogen Corynebacterium striatum in genus Corynebacterium are isolated and
identified by linear ion-trap multiple stage mass spectrometry (LIT MSn) with
high resolution mass measurement. We redefined several lipid structures that were
previously mis-assigned or not defined, including cytidine diphosphate
diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG), glucuronosyl diacylglycerol (GlcA-DAG),
(α-d-mannopyranosyl)-(1 → 4)-(α-D-glucuronyl diacyglycerol (Man-GlcA-DAG),
1-mycolyl-2-acyl-phosphatidylglycerol (MA-PG), acyl trehalose monomycolate
(acyl-TMM). We also report the structures of mycolic acid, phosphatidylglycerol, 
phosphatidylinositol, cardiolipin, trehalose dimycolate lipids in which many
isomeric structures are present. The LIT MSn approaches afford identification of 
the functional group, the fatty acid substituents and their regiospecificity in
the molecules, revealing the biodiversities of the lipid species in two
Corynebacterium strains that have played very different and important roles in
human nutrition and health.
