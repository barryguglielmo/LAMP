Minimum inhibitory concentration to delafloxacin and ciprofloxacin were performed
with Y. enterocolitica, Y. frederiksenii and Y. kristensenii. All organisms were 
sensitive to delafloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Our study indicates that
delafloxacin may have a reasonable in vitro susceptibility profile against
Yersinia among the species studied, which has not been previously reported.
