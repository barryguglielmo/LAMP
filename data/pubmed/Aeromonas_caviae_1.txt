Carnitine palmitoyltransferase deficiencies (CPD) are rare and caused by a defect
in fatty acid oxidation. We here report the case of a 10-year-old patient with no
particular previous history presenting with acute dyspnea associated with
productive cough, fever and impaired general condition. The patient was polypneic
with tachycardia, mitral systolic murmur and no sign of heart failure. Chest
x-ray showed cardiomegaly and echocardiography revealed hypokinetic dilated
cardiomyopathy. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase deficiency was diagnosed.
Management was based on treatment for heart disease and strict hypopidic and
hyperglucidic diet. Three months later, the patient presented with decompensated 
heart failure due to infection caused by antibiotic-resistant Aeromonas caviae
identified in blood culture. CPD should be suspected in patients with dilated
cardiomyopathy. This would enable early management which influences prognosis.
