BACKGROUND: Enterobacter cloacae species is responsible for nosocomial outbreaks 
in vulnerable patients in neonatal intensive care units (NICU). The environment
can constitute the reservoir and source of infection in NICUs. Herein we report
the impact of preventive measures implemented after an Enterobacter cloacae
outbreak inside a NICU.
METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in one level 3 NICU in Lyon,
France, over a 6 year-period (2012-2018). After an outbreak of Enterobacter
cloacae infections in hospitalized neonates in 2013, several measures were
implemented including intensive biocleaning and education of medical staff.
Clinical and microbiological characteristics of infected patients and evolution
of colonization/infection with Enterobacter spp. in this NICU were retrieved.
Moreover, whole genome sequencing was performed on 6 outbreak strains.
RESULTS: Enterobacter spp. was isolated in 469 patients and 30 patients developed
an infection including 2 meningitis and 12 fatal cases. Preventive measures and
education of medical staff were not associated with a significant decrease in
patient colonisation but led to a persistent decreased use of cephalosporin in
the NICU. Infection strains were genetically diverse, supporting the hypothesis
of multiple hygiene defects rather than the diffusion of a single clone.
CONCLUSIONS: Grouped cases of infections inside one setting are not necessarily
related to a single-clone outbreak and could reveal other environmental and
organisational problematics. The fight against implementation and transmission of
Enterobacter spp. in NICUs remains a major challenge.
