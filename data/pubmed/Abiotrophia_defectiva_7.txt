Infective endocarditis (IE) is primarily a bacterial infection of the heart
valves. The most common organisms implicated include Staphylococcus and
Streptococcus species. However, with the advent of MALDI-TOF and molecular
techniques, the reports of IE being caused by rare organisms are on a rise. Here 
we describe a case of IE due to Abiotrophia defectiva. This is the first report
of simultaneous infection of both mitral and aortic valves by Abiotrophia
defectiva from India. IE caused by Abiotrophia defectiva has been seen to be more
severe, associated with higher failure rates and relapse. This emphasizes the
accurate identification of nutritionally variant Streptococcus (NVS) species as
the management of choice varies between Abiotrophia and Granulicatella.
