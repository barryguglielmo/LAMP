For a One-Health investigation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Enterococcus 
spp., isolates from humans and beef cattle along with abattoirs, manured fields, 
natural streams, and wastewater from both urban and cattle feedlot sources were
collected over two years. Species identification of Enterococcus revealed
distinct associations across the continuum. Of the 8430 isolates collected,
Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis were the main species in urban
wastewater (90%) and clinical human isolates (99%); Enterococcus hirae
predominated in cattle (92%) and feedlot catch-basins (60%), whereas natural
streams harbored environmental Enterococcus spp. Whole-genome sequencing of E.
faecalis (n = 366 isolates) and E. faecium (n = 342 isolates), revealed source
clustering of isolates, indicative of distinct adaptation to their respective
environments. Phenotypic resistance to tetracyclines and macrolides encoded by
tet(M) and erm(B) respectively, was prevalent among Enterococcus spp. regardless 
of source. For E. faecium from cattle, resistance to β-lactams and quinolones was
observed among 3% and 8% of isolates respectively, compared to 76% and 70% of
human clinical isolates. Clinical vancomycin-resistant E. faecium exhibited high 
rates of multi-drug resistance, with resistance to all β-lactam, macrolides, and 
quinolones tested. Differences in the AMR profiles among isolates reflected
antimicrobial use practices in each sector of the One-Health continuum.
