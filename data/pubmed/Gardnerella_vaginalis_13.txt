Female genital tract infections have a high incidence among different age groups 
and represent an important impact on public health. Among them, vaginitis refers 
to inflammation of the vulva and/or vagina due to the presence of pathogens that 
cause trichomoniasis, bacterial vaginosis, and vulvovaginal candidiasis. Several 
discomforts are associated with these infections, as well as pregnancy
complications and facilitation of HIV transmission and acquisition. The
increasing resistance of microorganisms to drugs used in therapy is remarkable,
since women report the recurrence of these infections and associated
comorbidities. Different resistance mechanisms already described for the drugs
used in the therapy against Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida spp., and Gardnerella 
vaginalis, as well as aspects related to pathogenesis and treatment, are
discussed in this review. This study aims to contribute to drug design, avoiding 
therapy ineffectiveness due to drug resistance. Effective alternative therapies
to treat vaginitis will reduce the recurrence of infections and, consequently,
the high costs generated in the health system, improving women's wellbeing.
