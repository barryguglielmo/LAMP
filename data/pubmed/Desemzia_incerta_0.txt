Samples were collected from different undisturbed areas along the coast of
Gujarat like Okha, Diu, Veraval, and Somnath. A total of 68 marine isolates were 
obtained out of which 53 were associated with various marine macroorganisms like 
sponges, gastropods, and algae, whereas 15 were free living. Quorum-quenching
ability of all the isolates was tested against Chromobacterium violaceum MK by
co-culture technique as a way to simultaneously detect signal-degrading as well
as nondegrading quorum-sensing inhibitors. Nineteen macroorganism-associated
bacteria and eight free-living bacteria were found to possess quorum-sensing
inhibitory activity against C. violaceum MK without affecting its growth. Isolate
OA22 from grape alga and OA10 from purple sponge (Haliclona sp.) were found to
possess the highest C6-HSL degradation activity and extracellular
non-N-acyl-homoserine lactone degrading QSI activity, respectively. OA22 was also
found to degrade 3-oxo-C12 homoserine lactone. Acid recovery of both the C6- and 
C12-HSL after degradation by OA22 indicated the presence of lactonase enzyme in
the isolate. Cell-free supernatant of OA10 was extracted with ethyl acetate to
obtain the quorum-quenching compound. Pigment inhibition in C. violaceum MK
treated with OA10 extract was demonstrated in various ways and was indicative of 
QSI activity of the extract without degradation of the quorum-sensing signaling
molecule. The isolates OA22 and OA10 were identified as Desemzia incerta and
Bacillus sp., respectively, by 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analysis.
