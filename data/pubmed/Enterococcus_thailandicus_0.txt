Colitis induced by C. difficile is one of the most common and costly
healthcare-related infections for humans. Probiotics are one of the most
promising approaches for controlling CDI. Here, we presented the isolation,
safety, and probiotic property evaluation of a novel E. thailandicus strain, d5B,
with effective antimicrobial activity against C. difficile. Strain d5B showed
strong bactericidal effects on at least 54C. difficile strains. Safety tests
showed that strain d5B was sensitive to clinically important antibiotics, and had
no haemolytic and cytotoxic activities. Whole genomic analysis showed strain d5B 
only contained one aminoglycoside resistance gene located in the chromosome.
Moreover, d5B was devoid of functional virulence genes. Finally, strain d5B
exhibited probiotic properties, such as tolerance to the gastrointestinal tract, 
and adhered well to HT-29 cells. In conclusion, the E. thailandicus strain d5B
should be investigated further for useful properties as a novel candidate
probiotic for controlling CDI.
