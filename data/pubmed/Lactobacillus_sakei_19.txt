Lactobacillus sakei MBEL1397(=KCTC14037BP) was isolated from kimchi, a
traditional Korean fermented food, in Gangwon province, Republic of Korea.
MBEL1397 is an acid-tolerant strain with antimicrobial activity and α-glucosidase
inhibitory activity, which might be preliminary indications of its probiotic
properties. Complete genome sequencing of L. sakei MBEL1397 was performed using
the PacBio RSII platform. MBEL1397 has a 1,994,569 bp circular chromosome with
41.04% G+C content. The genome includes 1,946 protein-coding genes, 66 transfer
RNA genes, and 21 ribosomal RNA genes. The BioProject has been deposited at
DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank. The GenBank accession numbers are PRJNA598112 for the
BioProject, SAMN13698554 for the BioSample, and CP048116 for the chromosome.
