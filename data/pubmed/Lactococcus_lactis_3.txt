The increased incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Western and
rapidly Westernizing developing countries poses a global pandemic threat. The
development of affordable drugs for treating IBD worldwide is thus a priority.
Genetically modified lactic acid bacteria (gmLAB) as microbial therapeutics are
inexpensive protein producers suitable for use as carriers of protein to the
intestinal mucosa. Here, we successfully constructed gmLAB hypersecreting
interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). Oral administration of these gmLAB
suppressed body weight reduction and exacerbation of the disease activity index
score in mice with acute colitis and decreased the number of CD4+ IL-17A+ cells
in the mesenteric lymph nodes. These data suggest that the gmLAB deliver IL-1Ra
to the colon, where it inhibits IL-1 signaling. We thus developed a novel IBD
therapeutic that blocks IL-1 signaling using a gmLAB protein delivery system.
This system could be an inexpensive oral microbial therapeutic.
