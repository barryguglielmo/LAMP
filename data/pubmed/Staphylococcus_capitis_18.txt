The inactivation and damage of histamine-forming bacteria (HFB), Enterobacter
aerogenes and Staphylococcus capitis, in a 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH
6.8) and marlin meat slurry by high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) treatments were
studied using viability measurement and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). HHP
treatments showed first order destruction kinetics to E. aerogenes and S. capitis
during the pressure holding period. HFB in marlin meat slurry had higher D values
and were more resistant to HHP treatments than in phosphate buffer. In phosphate 
buffer, E. aerogenes had higher D values than S. capitis at >380 MPa of pressure,
whereas the reverse trend was noticed at lower pressures (<380 MPa). In marlin
meat slurry, S. capitis had a higher D value than E. aerogenes at the same
treatment pressure, indicating that S. capitis was more resistant to HHP
treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate that HHP can
be used to inactivate HFB, E. aerogenes, and S. capitis, by causing disruption to
bacterial cell membrane and cell wall as demonstrated by SEM micrographs.
