Some well-known Clostridiales species such as Clostridium difficile and C.
perfringens are agents of high impact diseases worldwide. Nevertheless, other
foreseen Clostridiales species have recently emerged such as Clostridium tertium 
and C. paraputrificum. Three fecal isolates were identified as Clostridium
tertium (Gcol.A2 and Gcol.A43) and C. paraputrificum (Gcol.A11) during public
health screening for C. difficile infections in Colombia. C. paraputrificum
genomes were highly diverse and contained large numbers of accessory genes.
Genetic diversity and accessory gene percentage were lower among the C. tertium
genomes than in the C. paraputrificum genomes. C. difficile tcdA and tcdB toxins 
encoding homologous sequences and other potential virulence factors were also
identified. EndoA interferase, a toxic component of the type II toxin-antitoxin
system, was found among the C. tertium genomes. toxA was the only toxin encoding 
gene detected in Gcol.A43, the Colombian isolate with an
experimentally-determined high cytotoxic effect. Gcol.A2 and Gcol.A43 had higher 
sporulation efficiencies than Gcol.A11 (84.5%, 83.8% and 57.0%, respectively), as
supported by the greater number of proteins associated with sporulation pathways 
in the C. tertium genomes compared with the C. paraputrificum genomes (33.3 and
28.4 on average, respectively). This work allowed complete genome description of 
two clostridiales species revealing high levels of intra-taxa diversity,
accessory genomes containing virulence-factors encoding genes (especially in C.
paraputrificum), with proteins involved in sporulation processes more highly
represented in C. tertium. These finding suggest the need to advance in the study
of those species with potential importance at public health level.
