High concentration restaurant oily wastewater from restaurants and food
processing industries discharged into water environment usually results in
environment pollution and inhibits the activity of microorganisms in biological
wastewater treatment systems. In this study, 75 strains from oily sludge were
isolated with oil degradation activity for edible oil-contained wastewater. Eight
isolates were able to grow well in liquid cultures with edible oil as the sole
carbon source and discovered with high efficient oil-degrading ability. Seven out
of eight isolates were identified as Acinetobacter and one isolate as Kluyvera
cryocrescens, based on their 16S rRNA gene sequences. Three highly efficient oil 
degrading bacteria (Acinetobacter dijkshoorniae LYC46-2, Kluyvera cryocrescens
LYC50-1a and Acinetobacter pittii LYC73-4b) were selected and their degradation
characteristic were examined, the results showed that the three isolates were
effective under pH range from 7.0 to 10.0, and temperature from 25 to 35 °C. For 
degradation of 2-4% (v/v) of vegetable oil, > 85% degradation percentage were
obtained within 30 h. Degradation of the higher concentration oil (6-8%, v/v)
result in 50-70% degradation percentage within 72 h, and the degradation
percentage for the isolated strains were decreased about 50% for the degradation 
of 10% oil (< 45%) compared to 2% oil. Different type of oils were also
tested, > 90% of degradation percentage were obtained by the three isolates,
implied that these strains are capable of removing various oils efficiently.
These results suggested that Acinetobacter dijkshoorniae LYC46-2, Kluyvera
cryocrescens LYC50-1a and Acinetobacter pittii LYC73-4b are potential species
could be efficiently used for high concentration restaurant oily wastewater
treatment and might be applicable to a wastewater treatment system for the
removal of oil.
