Nisin is a small peptide produced by Lactococcus lactis ssp lactis that is
currently industrially produced. This preservative is often used for growth
prevention of pathogenic bacteria contaminating the food products. However, the
use of nisin as a food preservative is limited by its low production during
fermentation. This low production is mainly attributed to the multitude of
parameters influencing the fermentation progress such as bacterial cells
activity, growth medium composition (namely carbon and nitrogen sources), pH,
ionic strength, temperature, and aeration. This review article focuses on the
main parameters that affect nisin production by Lactococcus lactis bacteria.
Moreover, nisin applications as a food preservative and the main strategies
generally used are also discussed.
