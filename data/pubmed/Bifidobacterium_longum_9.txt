BACKGROUND: Prophylactic strategies are urgently needed for prevention of severe 
inflammatory responses to respiratory viral infections. Bacterial-host
interactions may modify the immune response to viral infections.
METHODS: We examined the contribution of Intranasal administration of two
different Bifidobacterium longum strains or its isolated cell wall in controlling
viral induced inflammation using a murine model of influenza infection. We
monitored mortality and morbidity over a 10-day period and viral load,
differential broncho alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid inflammatory cell counts, Lung
tissue histology, BAL and serum cytokines, markers of vascular damage and cell
death were quantified.
FINDINGS: Intranasal administration of Bifidobacterium longum35624® or its
isolated cell wall prior to virus inoculation significantly reduced viral load
within the lungs and significantly improved survival. Reduced viral load was
associated with reduced lung injury as suggested by cell death and vascular
leakage markers, a shift from neutrophil to macrophage recruitment, reduced
inflammatory cytokine levels (including IL-6), reduced type 1 and 2 interferon
levels, but increased levels of interferon-λ and surfactant protein D. These
protective effects were maintained when the bifidobacterial cell wall preparation
was administered 24 h after viral inoculation. The protective effects were also
observed for the Bifidobacterium longumPB-VIR™ strain.
INTERPRETATION: Exposure to these bifidobacterial strains protect against the
inflammatory sequelae and damage associated with uncontrolled viral replication
within the lung.
