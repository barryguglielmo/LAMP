Enterobacter aerogenes is a member of the ESKAPE group of bacteria, and
multi-drug-resistant strains are increasingly being found. In this study, a novel
bacteriophage, ATCEA85, which infects E. aerogenes, has been isolated and
characterized. ATCEA85 is seen to have a circularly permuted linear
double-stranded DNA genome of 47,484 base pairs in length. The closest related
phage found in the databases is the Klebsiella phage Kp3, which exhibits 77%
identity over a 34% query coverage. The G+C content of ATCEA85 is 56.2%, and 15
putative open reading frames are functionally annotated.
