Bartonellae are emerging zoonotic vector-borne pathogens causing a broad spectrum
of clinical symptoms in humans and animals, including life-threatening
endocarditis. Dogs are infected with a wide range of Bartonella species and
infection has been reported in free-roaming dogs from various South American
countries. We report a high Bartonella seroprevalence in 82 Chilean stray dogs.
More than half of the dogs from Linares (72.7%, n = 66) and Puerto Montt (56.2%, 
n = 16) were seropositive for Bartonella henselae, Bartonella vinsonii ssp.
berkhoffii, or Bartonella clarridgeiae with antibody titers ranging from 1:64 to 
1:512. Three dogs (3.6%) were PCR positive for Bartonella sp. Partial sequencing 
of the gltA gene indicated that two dogs were infected with B. henselae, and one 
with a strain close to Bartonella vinsonii ssp. vinsonii. Exposure to Bartonella 
species was common in stray Chilean dogs, as for other South American countries, 
likely associated with heavy ectoparasite infestation.
