3-[4-(Substituted)phenyl-/4-(diphenylmethyl)phenylpiperazin-1-yl]-2-hydroxypropyl
-1-[(substituted)phenyl]carbamates and their salts with hydrochloric acid were
synthesized, characterized, and tested in vitro against Staphylococcus aureus
ATCC 29213 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 as reference and quality control 
strains, against three methicillin-resistant isolates of S. aureus, and three
isolates of vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis. All the compounds were evaluated
against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra/ATCC 25177, M. kansasii DSM 44162, and
M. smegmatis ATCC 700084. All of the tested compounds demonstrated very good
activity against all the tested strains/isolates comparable with or better than
that of clinically used drugs (ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, isoniazid).
1-[{(3-Trifluoromethyl)phenyl}carbamoyloxy-2-hydroxypropyl]-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl
)piperazin-1-ium chloride demonstrated the highest potency against all the tested
strains/isolates (MICs ranged from 3.78 to 30.2 µM), and
1-[{(3-trifluoromethyl)phenyl}carbamoyloxy-2-hydroxypropyl]-4-(diphenylmethyl)pip
erazin-1-ium chloride was the most effective against all the screened
mycobacterial strains (MICs ranged from 3.64 to 14.5 µM). All the investigated
derivatives had strong antibiofilm activity against S. aureus ATCC 29123 and a
synergistic or additive effect with gentamicin against isolates of E. faecalis
with both intrinsic and acquired resistance to gentamicin. The screening of the
cytotoxicity of the compounds was performed using human monocytic leukemia THP-1 
cells. The IC50 values of the most effective compounds ranged from ca. 2.8 to
7.3 µM; thus, it can be stated that the antimicrobial effect is closely connected
with their cytotoxicity. These observations disqualify these compounds from
further development as antimicrobial agents, but they can be considered potential
multi-target drugs with a preferred anticancer effect with good water solubility 
and additional anti-infectious activity.
