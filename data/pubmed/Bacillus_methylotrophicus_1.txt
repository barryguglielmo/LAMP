Bacillus velezensis strain BZR 517 is a prospective plant growth-promoting
rhizobacterium with known biocontrol properties, which may be used to improve
soil quality. The genome sequencing was conducted as part of new biological agent
development in order to determine the biocontrol potential of the strain,
including the production of biologically active compounds.
