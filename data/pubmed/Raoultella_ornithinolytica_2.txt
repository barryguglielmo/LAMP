Background and Aim: Raoultella ornithinolytica is one of the emerging
gram-negative bacteria, which associated with foodborne illness. Researches
affirmed that distinguish between R. ornithinolytica and Klebsiella oxytoca are
difficult, as they are phylogenetic related. The evolution of multidrug
resistance of Raoultella strains gained more concern for recognition of the
pathogen which supports in controlling the disease and minify its threat. This
study sought to find a reliable tool for the identification of Raoultella
ornithinolytica, isolated from chicken product samples, and assessed the
resistance profile of R. ornithinolytica using antibiogram sensitivity tests.
Materials and Methods: Forty samples of chicken products were collected between
January and September 2019 from different markets in Alexandria Governorate,
Egypt. The products included nuggets, strips, burgers, luncheon meats, pane,
frankfurters, and minced chicken meat. The samples were transferred to the
Reference Laboratory. The samples were subjected to isolation, biochemical
reaction testing, phenotypic system analytical profile index (API) E20, and a
detection of antimicrobial susceptibility test. Phenotypic identification was
confirmed through matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time-of-flight mass
spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS).
Results: Thirty-three bacterial isolates (82.50%) out of 40 samples were isolated
into pure cultures from the chicken samples. Three isolates (9.09%) were positive
for R. ornithinolytica, while 30 isolates (90.91%) exhibited growth characters
for different pathogens (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus
vulgaris, R. ornithinolytica, and Klebsiella pneumoniae). The isolates of R.
ornithinolytica were resistant to five types of antibiotics and sensitive to two 
types of antibiotics.
Conclusion: This study reported the first case of R. ornithinolytica found in
chicken products in Egypt. Phenotypic system API 20E and MALDI-TOF MS were found 
to be reliable tools for confirming the diagnosis of R. ornithinolytica. As it
provides rapid identification with high sensitivity and specificity for R.
ornithinolytica, which often do not require a molecular procedure for
confirmation.
