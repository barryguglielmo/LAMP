Bacillus cereus is a foodborne pathogen causing emesis and diarrhea in those
affected. It is assumed that the non-hemolytic enterotoxin (Nhe) plays a key role
in B. cereus induced diarrhea. The ability to trace Nhe activity is important for
food safety. While assays such as PCR and ELISA exist to detect Nhe, those
methods cannot differentiate between active and inactive forms of Nhe. The
existing rabbit ileal loop bioassay used to detect Nhe activity is ethically
disfavored because it uses live experimental animals. Here we present a custom
built low-cost CCD based luminometer and applied it in conjunction with a
cell-based assay using Vero cells transduced to express the luciferase enzyme.
The activity of Nhe was measured as its ability to inhibit synthesis of
luciferase as quantified by reduction of light emission by the luciferase
reaction. Emitted light intensity was observed to be inversely proportional to
Nhe concentration over a range of 7 ng/ml to 125 ng/ml, with a limit of detection
of 7 ng/ml Nhe.
