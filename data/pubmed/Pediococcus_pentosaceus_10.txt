Bacteriocin-producing Escherichia coli ICVB442, E. coli ICVB443, Enterococcus
faecalis ICVB497, E. faecalis ICVB501, and Pediococcus pentosaceus ICVB491
strains were examined for their pathogenic risks and compatibility and hence
suitability as consortium probiotic bacteria. Except for E. coli ICVB442, all
were inclined to form biofilm. All were gelatinase-negative, sensitive to most of
the antibiotics tested and not cytotoxic to porcine intestinal epithelial cells
(IPEC-1) when tested at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. P. pentosaceus
ICVB491 stood apart by inhibiting the other four strains. Both E. coli strains
and E. faecalis ICVB497 strain were β-hemolytic. Survival in the TIM-1 dynamic
model of the human digestive system was 139% for the tested E. coli ICVB443
strain, 46% for P. pentosaceus ICVB491, and 32% for the preferred E. faecalis
ICVB501 strain. These three potential probiotics, which are bacteriocin-producing
strains, will be considered for simultaneous use as consortium with synergistic
interactions in vivo on animal model.
