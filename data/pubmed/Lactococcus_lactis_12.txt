Lactococcus lactis is a lactic acid bacterium widely used as a starter culture in
the manufacture of dairy products, especially a wide variety of cheeses. Improved
industrial strains would help to manufacture better food products that can meet
the industry's and consumer's demands with respect to e.g. quality, taste,
texture and shelf life. Bacteriophage infection of L. lactis starter cultures
represents one of the main causes of fermentation failure and consequent economic
losses for the dairy industry. In this study, however, we aim at employing
bacteriophages for beneficial purposes. We developed an experimental setup to
assess whether phage-mediated horizontal gene transfer could be used to enhance
the genetic characteristics of L. lactis strains in accordance with the European 
law regarding the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in the food
industry. Although we could not show the transfer of chromosomal DNA we did
successfully transduce two dissimilar plasmids from L. lactis strain MG1363 to
one of its derivatives employing three different lactococcal bacteriophages.
