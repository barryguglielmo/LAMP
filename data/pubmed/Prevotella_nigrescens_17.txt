Prevotella spp. are frequently identified in Cystic Fibrosis sputum. This study
examined whether infection with Prevotella nigrescens, a frequently identified
member of this species, contributes to inflammation in CF bronchial epithelial
cells through activation of TLR- and NF-κB signalling pathways. CFBE41o- cells
were infected with either P.nigrescens or Pseudomonas aeruginosa and incubated
under anaerobic conditions for 4h. P.nigrescens activated TLR2 signalling but not
TLR4 signalling while P.aeruginosa activated TLR4 signalling with a lesser effect
on TLR2. P.aeruginosa induced significant IκBα phosphorylation 10min post
infection with a return to control levels by 30min post infection. A significant 
induction in nuclear p65 DNA binding was observed at 2h post infection. In
contrast, infection with P.nigrescens induced phosphorylation of IκBα 120min post
infection, with significant induction in nuclear p65 DNA binding at 4h post
infection only. Cytokine gene and protein responses were lower for P.nigrescens
compared to P.aeruginosa. This study demonstrates the ability of a clinical
P.nigrescens isolate to provoke a delayed NF-κB(p65) driven response through
induction in TLR2 signalling and activation of sustained levels of IKKα.
