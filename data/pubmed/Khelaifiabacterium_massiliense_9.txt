BACKGROUND: Good's syndrome (GS) is characterized by immunodeficiency, and can
lead to severe infection, which is the most significant complication. Although
Mycobacterium rarely causes infection in patients with GS, disseminated
nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection frequently occurs in GS patients
that are also positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or
anti-interferon (IFN)-γ autoantibodies. Here, we report a rare case of GS with
NTM without HIV or IFN-γ autoantibodies.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old Japanese male with GS and myasthenia gravis
(treated with prednisolone and tacrolimus) was diagnosed with disseminated NTM
infection caused by Mycobacterium abscessus subsp. massiliense. He presented with
fever and back pain. Blood, lumbar tissue, urine, stool, and sputum cultures
tested positive for M. abscessus. Bacteremia, spondylitis, intestinal lumber
abscess, and lung infection were confirmed by bacteriological examination and
diagnostic imaging; urinary and intestinal tract infections were suspected by
bacteriological examination but not confirmed by imaging. Despite multidrug
combination therapy, including azithromycin, imipenem/cilastatin, levofloxacin,
minocycline, linezolid, and sitafloxacin, the patient ultimately died of the
infection. The patient tested negative for HIV and anti-IFN-γ autoantibodies.
CONCLUSIONS: Since myasthenia gravis symptoms interfere with therapy, patients
with GS and their physicians should carefully consider the antibacterial
treatment options against disseminated NTM.
