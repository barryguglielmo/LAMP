OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the antibacterial, cytotoxicity, and
mechanical properties of a dental adhesive modified with quaternary ammonium
monomer ((2-acryloyloxyethyl)dimethyldodecylammonium bromide) and cross-linker
(bis(2-acryloyloxyethyl)methyldodecylammonium bromide).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Monomer (M), cross-linker (C), or a combination of these
(M + C) were incorporated into adhesive Adper Single Bond Plus (SB) in 5, 10, or 
25% (as wt%). A colony-forming unit and MTT assays were used to evaluate
antibacterial properties against Streptococcus mutans and cell viability.
Resin-dentin beams (0.9 ± 0.1 mm2) were evaluated for micro-tensile bond strength
(μTBS) after 24 h, 6 months, and 3 years. Hourglass specimens were evaluated for 
ultimate tensile strength (UTS) after 24 h, 1 week, and 6 months. Micro-hardness 
measurements after softening in ethanol were taken as an indirect assessment of
the polymer cross-linking density. Kruskal-Wallis, one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, 
and Student's t test were used for analysis of the antibacterial, cytotoxicity,
μTBS, UTS, and hardness data, all with a significance level of p < 0.05.
RESULTS: 10%M and 25%M demonstrated a significant reduction in S. mutans relative
to SB (p < 0.001). No differences in cytotoxicity were detected for any of the
groups. After 6 months, no changes in μTBS were shown for any of the groups.
After 3 years, all groups evidenced a significant decrease in μTBS (p < 0.05)
except 5%M, 5%C, and 5%M + 5%C. All groups demonstrated either stable or
significantly increased UTS after 6 months. Except for the cross-linker groups, a
significant decrease in micro-hardness was shown for all groups after softening
in ethanol (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: A 5-10% of monomer may render the resin antibacterial without a
compromise to its mechanical and bonding properties.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Biomodification of a resin adhesive with an antibacterial
monomer and cross-linker may help improve the life span of adhesive restorations.
