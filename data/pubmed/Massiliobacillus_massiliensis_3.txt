Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common severe psychiatric illness,
exhibiting sub-optimal response to existing pharmacological treatments. Although 
its etiopathogenesis is still not completely understood, recent findings suggest 
that an altered composition of the gut microbiota might play a role. Here we
aimed to explore potential differences in the composition of the gut microbiota
between patients with MDD and healthy controls (HC) and to identify possible
signatures of treatment response by analyzing two groups of MDD patients
characterized as treatment-resistant (TR) or responders (R) to antidepressants.
Stool samples were collected from 34 MDD patients (8 TR, 19 R and 7 untreated)
and 20 HC. Microbiota was characterized using the 16S metagenomic approach. A
penalized logistic regression analysis algorithm was applied to identify
bacterial populations that best discriminate the diagnostic groups. Statistically
significant differences were identified for the families of Paenibacillaceae and 
Flavobacteriaceaea, for the genus Fenollaria, and the species Flintibacter
butyricus, Christensenella timonensis, and Eisenbergiella massiliensis among
others. The phyla Proteobacteria, Tenericutes and the family
Peptostreptococcaceae were more abundant in TR, whereas the phylum Actinobacteria
was enriched in R patients. Moreover, a number of bacteria only characterized the
microbiota of TR patients, and many others were only detected in R. Our results
confirm that dysbiosis is a hallmark of MDD and suggest that microbiota of TR
patients significantly differs from responders to antidepressants. This finding
further supports the relevance of an altered composition of the gut microbiota in
the etiopathogenesis of MDD, suggesting a role in response to antidepressants.
