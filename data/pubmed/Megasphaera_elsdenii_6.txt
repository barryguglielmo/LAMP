Caproic acid (CA) was produced by Megasphaera elsdenii T81 with Jerusalem
artichoke tubers (JA) as a feedstock. More CA was produced under the medium with 
the acid hydrolysate of JA than the comparative medium with a carbon composition 
similar to that of JA. CA was produced up to 13.0 g/L and 0.52 g/L/h with
extractive fermentation using a mixed solvent of alamine 336 in oleyl alcohol at 
37 °C. The JA cost to produce 1 ton of CA is only 505 USD, which is much lower
than that required for purchasing sucrose (860 USD) in CA production. As a result
of the analysis performed using SuperPro Designer, including the cost of
distillation to obtain pure CA, the estimated production cost for CA from dry JA 
is 1869 USD/ton CA at the production scale of 2000 ton/year, which is lower than 
the current market price for petroleum-derived CA (~2500 USD/ton).
