The gut microbiota is crucial in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM). However, the metabolism of T2DM patients is not well-understood. We aimed
to identify the differences on composition and function of gut microbiota between
T2DM patients with obesity and healthy people. In this study, 6 T2DM patients
with obesity and 6 healthy volunteers were recruited, and metagenomic approach
and bioinformatics analysis methods were used to understand the composition of
the gut microbiota and the metabolic network. We found a decrease in the
abundance of Firmicutes, Oribacterium, and Paenibacillus; this may be attributed 
to a possible mechanism and biological basis of T2DM; moreover, we identified
three critical bacterial taxa, Bacteroides plebeius, Phascolarctobacterium sp.
CAG207, and the order Acidaminococcales that can potentially be used for T2DM
treatment. We also revealed the composition of the microbiota through functional 
annotation based on multiple databases and found that carbohydrate metabolism
contributed greatly to the pathogenesis of T2DM. This study helps in elucidating 
the different metabolic roles of microbes in T2DM patients with obesity.
