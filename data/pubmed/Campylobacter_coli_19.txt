AIM: To analyse the prevalence, genetic diversity and antimicrobial
susceptibility of Campylobacter spp. in northern Spain.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Campylobacter was isolated from 139 samples of broiler meat 
and faecal dropping of broiler and swine with a prevalence of 35·4, 62 and 42·8%,
respectively. Campylobacter jejuni (n = 55) and Campylobacter coli (n = 31) were 
identified by multiplex-PCR in meat, faeces and human clinical samples while
Campylobacter fetus (n = 3) was exclusively detected in the latter.
Fingerprinting by flaA-RFLP and PFGE revealed 68 different genotypes from the 89 
isolates with a Biodiversity Simpson's index of 0·98. The 86·5% of the isolates
were resistant to ciprofloxacin, 85·4% to tetracycline and 49·4% to erythromycin;
only three genotypes were susceptible to the three antimicrobial drugs. Multidrug
resistance was detected in the 40·7% of the isolates.
CONCLUSIONS: Campylobacter remains prevalent in northern Spain with a high
biodiversity degree. About 93·3% of the isolates were resistant to one or more
drugs.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Although different measures are taken to
control Campylobacter, the detection of isolates resistant to the drugs used in
the treatment of campylobacteriosis is still high, including different species
and genotypes. This evidences the need of additional strategies against this
pathogen.
