OBJECTIVES: To provide a descriptive analysis for species identification of
culture and Gram stain results from ultrasound transducers and multiuse
ultrasound transmission gel bottle tips in active clinical use and to compare
bacterial cultures from ultrasound transducers before and after aseptic
cleansing.
METHODS: A prospective blinded descriptive analytic study of 18 distinct clinical
care sites within a single primary clinical institution was conducted. Before and
after a disinfectant towel cleanse, transducers were pressed against tryptic soy 
agar contact plates. Plates were deidentified and submitted for blind incubation,
Gram staining, and species identification with microsequencing. Results were
classified as clinically relevant (CR) or non-clinically relevant. In total, 188 
samples were analyzed: 80 from ultrasound transducers before and cleansing, 13
from multiuse gel bottle tips before and after cleansing, and 2 precleansing
samples from the data collector's pen and badge.
RESULTS: Fifty-nine precleansing samples (73.8%) grew cultures with CR bacteria, 
and 21 samples (26.3%) did not. Staphylococcus simulans represented 31.0% of all 
positive culture samples. Thirteen postcleansing samples (16.3%) grew cultures
with CR bacteria, equating to a 78.0% reduction of CR bacterial growth
(likelihood ratio, 57.10; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound transducers have a notable CR bacterial burden and may
serve as potential infective vectors. Aseptic cleansing effectively eliminates
most of the bacterial load from ultrasound transducers, but some bacteria
persist, presenting a risk of nosocomial infection with ultrasound-guided
interventions. These findings support American Institute of Ultrasound in
Medicine 2018 guidelines intended to ensure an appropriate level of transducer
preparation based on the examination type while emphasizing rational infection
control measures to minimize the risk of potential patient harm.
