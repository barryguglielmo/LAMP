The bacteriological diagnosis of intestinal bacterial infections has historically
been based on culture on agar plates. However, culture may lack sensitivity, and 
some enteropathogens, such as pathovars of Escherichia coli, may escape routine
diagnosis. Our goal was to evaluate the analytical performance of the Novodiag
Bacterial GE+ kit for the detection of enteropathogenic bacteria in acute
community diarrhea. We included 251 stools in this study (198 retrospective and
53 prospective). The analytical performance was calculated using a composite
reference standard (CRS) in the absence of a perfect gold standard (lack of
sensitivity of culture). The CRS was defined as positive if culture was positive 
or, in case of a negative culture, if the BD Max extended enteric bacterial panel
and/or other real-time PCR (RT-PCR) tests were positive. Of the 251 samples, 200 
were positive, and 51 were negative. Overall sensitivities of the Novodiag
Bacterial GE+ kit for Campylobacter sp., Salmonella sp., Shigella
sp./enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), Yersinia enterocolitica, enterohemorrhagic E. 
coli (EHEC), and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) ranged from 98.98 to 100%,
specificities ranged from 98.08 to 100%, positive predictive values (PPVs) ranged
from 88.24 to 100%, and negative predictive values (NVPs) ranged from 99.36 to
100%. The analytical performance of the Novodiag Bacterial GE+ kit is excellent. 
It can be used as a routine tool in the rapid diagnosis of bacterial
gastroenteritis. Despite the eNAT tube dilution of the primary sample, the
detection of Salmonella sp. and EHEC was perfect. The kit has the advantage of
only detecting pathogenic Y. enterocolitica Its performance for Campylobacter is 
very satisfactory.
