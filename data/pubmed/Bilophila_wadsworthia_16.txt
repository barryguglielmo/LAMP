In this study, we aimed to evaluate the composition of the intestinal microbiota 
and level of fecal calprotectin in Clostridioides difficile-colonized patients.
We included 102 C. difficile non-colonized (group I), 93 C. difficile colonized
subjects (group II), and 89 diarrhea patients with C. difficile (group III).
Chao1 index for alpha diversity and principal coordinate analysis was performed
for beta diversity using QIIME. The mean relative abundance in each group was
compared at the phylum and genus levels. Fecal calprotectin was measured using
EliA calprotectin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Group II showed significantly lower
levels of Sutterella, Blautia, Ruminococcus, Faecalibacterium, Bilophila, and
Ruminococcaceae and higher levels of Enterobacteriaceae compared to group I (p = 
0.012, 0.003, 0.002, 0.001, 0.027, 0.022, and 0.036, respectively). Toxigenic C. 
difficile colonized subjects showed significantly lower levels of Prevotella,
Phascolarctobacterium, Succinivibrio, Blautia, and higher levels of Bacteroides. 
The level of fecal calprotectin in group III was significantly higher than those 
in group I and group II (p < 0.001 for both). These data could be valuable in
understanding C. difficile colonization process and the microbiota and
inflammatory markers could be further studied to differentiate colonization from 
CDI.
