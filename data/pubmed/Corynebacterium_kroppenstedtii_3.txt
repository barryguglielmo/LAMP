A 35-year-old woman complained of an unpleasant odor for a few days after a
change in foundation cream. The patient had previously undergone
conjunctivo-dacryocystorhinostomy with a Jones tube fixed with non-absorbable
suture. Slit-lamp examination revealed an orange-colored discharge in the tube. A
culture test of the discharge showed Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii (1+),
Aspergillus versicolor (1+), and Mycobacterium chelonae (1+). After medical
treatment and suture removal, the discharge completely disappeared. This is the
first reported case of a Jones tube infection following
conjunctivo-dacryocystorhinostomy with multiple microorganisms, including C.
kroppenstedtii.
