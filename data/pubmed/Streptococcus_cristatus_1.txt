Septic Arthritis of the wrist is rare in the paediatric population due to its
extraarticular metaphysis. We report here a case of wrist septic arthritis in a
neonate caused by an uncommon causative organism, Streptococcus cristatus. A 15
days old male child was referred with the complaint of swelling and decreased
movement of the left wrist for 5 days. Local examination revealed warm, tender,
erythematous and fluctuant swelling over the dorso-ulnar aspect of the left
wrist. Ultrasonography of the affected region was suggestive of focal fluid
collection in the wrist and periosteal elevation of the distal ulna. Aspiration
followed by arthrotomy of the wrist joint was performed and multiple holes were
made in the distal ulnar metaphysis using 0.8mm k-wire. The pus culture was
positive for Streptococcus cristatus, sensitive to vancomycin, which was given
for a total of 4 weeks. At one year follow up the child had a full, painless
range of motion with no functional deficit. Final follow up x rays of the left
wrist were normal. Streptococcus cristatus strains are described as
Gram-positive, catalase-negative cocci, approximately 1 μm in diameter growing in
chains and were originally isolated from the human throat and oral cavities. Its 
association with bone and joint infections has not been described in the
literature. To our knowledge, this is the first case of isolated septic arthritis
of wrist in a 15 days old child caused by Streptococcus cristatus. To conclude,
wrist septic arthritis in a neonate is a rare entity. With the advanced
diagnostics, species-level identification of rare organism like Streptococcus
cristatus is possible along with antibiotic sensitivity for appropriate therapy. 
Early surgical decompression and intravenous culture-directed antibiotics are the
mainstays of management.
