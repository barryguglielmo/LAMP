The biological synthesis of metal nanoparticles using plant extracts with defined
size and morphology is a simple, nontoxic and environmentally friendly method.
The present study focused on the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) by
Artemisia annua L. extract as reducing and stabilising agent. The Ag NPs
function, as antibacterial agents, is with that they are further used in human
therapy. The effects of pH and temperature on the synthesis of NPs were
characterized by UV-absorption spectroscopy and shown by surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) band at 410 nm. NPs' size and morphology were measured by
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). TEM
images showed that Ag NPs were in a nano-sized range (20-90 nm) and had spherical
shape. Our findings demonstrated that lower concentration (100 µg mL-1) of the
biogenic Ag NPs exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-negative
Escherichia coli BW 25113 and Gram-positive Enterococcus hirae ATCC 9790.
