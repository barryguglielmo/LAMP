Enzyme immobilization has been widely used to improve the stability and
recyclability of enzymes in industrial processes. In this work, a
sortase-mediated and therefore selective covalent immobilization strategy
(sortagging) for enzymes on microgels (GelZyms) was investigated. Aqueous
microgels were synthesized from poly(N-vinylcaprolactam)/glycidyl methacrylate
(PVCL/GMA) and tagged with the sortase A recognition peptide sequence (LPETG) or 
its nucleophilic counterpart-tag (GGG). General applicability and selective
immobilization were confirmed by subsequent sortagging of five different enzymes 
(Bacillus subtilis lipase A (BSLA), Yersinia mollaretii phytase (Ym-phytase),
Escherichia coli copper efflux oxidase (CueO laccase), cellulase A2, and Bacillus
megaterium monooxygenase P450 BM3). The latter was performed directly from the
cell lysate to ensure cost-effective immobilization. All five immobilized enzymes
were catalytically active and could be recycled (e.g., laccase CueO and
monooxygenase P450 BM3 F87A; >55% residual activity after six cycles).
Application potential was demonstrated by using CueO decorated microgels for
bleaching of the synthetic dye indigo carmine.
