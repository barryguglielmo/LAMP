Bacterial diseases are a significant problem in the controlled rearing of fish.
Furunculosis (Aeromonas sp.), flavobacteriosis (Flavobacterium sp.), and
pseudomonadosis (Pseudomonas sp.) are currently the most frequently identified
diseases in recirculating aquaculture systems of various fish species. Such a
situation is also observed in pikeperch rearing. Due to the emerging difficulties
of effective prophylaxis using commercial vaccines, interest in the use of
autovaccinations is increasing, not only in ichthyopathology but also in other
veterinary fields. Our research aimed to assess the effect of the vaccination
method on the overall condition of the fish and survival after the experimental
infection with Aeromonas salmonicida. Pikeperch were vaccinated by (1) bath, (2) 
a single i.p. injection, or (3) feed. The fish were measured and weighed on day 0
and after 28 and 56 days of the experiment. Specific growth rate, daily growth
rate, condition factor, and feed conversion ratio were calculated. On days 7, 14,
21, and 28 of the experiment, ceruloplasmin and lysozyme levels were rated. In
addition, a challenge test was performed. The obtained results showed that the
method of vaccination is important and affects the growth of fish, the overall
condition of fish, and survival after experimental infection.
