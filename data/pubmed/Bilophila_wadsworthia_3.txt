Chagas disease is caused by the flagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi.
Cardiomyopathy and damage to gastrointestinal tissue are the main disease
manifestations. There are data suggesting that the immune response to T. cruzi
depends on the intestinal microbiota. We hypothesized that Chagas disease is
associated with an altered gut microbiome and that these changes are related to
the disease phenotype. The stool microbiome from 104 individuals, 73 with Chagas 
disease (30 with the cardiac, 11 with the digestive, and 32 with the
indeterminate form), and 31 healthy controls was characterized using 16S rRNA
amplification and sequencing. The QIIME (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial
Ecology) platform was used to analyze the data. Alpha and beta diversity indexes 
did not indicate differences between the groups. However, the relative abundance 
of Verrucomicrobia, represented primarily by the genus Akkermansia, was
significantly lower in the Chagas disease groups, especially the cardiac group,
compared to the controls. Furthermore, differences in the relative abundances of 
Alistipes, Bilophila, and Dialister were observed between the groups. We conclude
that T. cruzi infection results in changes in the gut microbiome that may play a 
role in the myocardial and intestinal inflammation seen in Chagas disease.
