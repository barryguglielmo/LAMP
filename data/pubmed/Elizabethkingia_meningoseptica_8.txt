Chryseobacterium gleum is a lactose nonfermenting Gram-negative bacillus (NFGNB) 
found in soil, plants, and some water sources but rarely implicated as a human
pathogen. Its scarcity in the medical literature and resistance to numerous
broad-spectrum antibiotics such as carbapenems, cephalosporins, and
beta-lactam/lactamase inhibitors pose a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. We 
present the first reported case, to the best of our knowledge, of sepsis from
central line-associated blood stream infection from Chryseobacterium gleum in the
United States.
