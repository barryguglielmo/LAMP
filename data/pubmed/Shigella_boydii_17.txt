Shigella flexneri is considered as an important causative agent of Shigellosis
causing diarrhea in the countries with a low socioeconomic status. No study has
been carried out on the molecular prevalence of S. flexneri in Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. So this study was designed to evaluate the molecular
prevalence of S. flexneri and their associated risk factors. A total of 2014
diarrheal stool samples were collected from January 2016 to May 2017 from
pediatrics patients of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa followed by identification of S.
flexneri through biochemical, serological, and molecular methods. The overall
prevalence of Shigella species was found to be 7.9% (n = 160). The predominant
Shigella specie was S. flexneri (n = 155, 96.8%) followed by S. boydii (n = 5,
3.1%). Interestingly, no sample was found positive for S. sonnei and S.
dysenteriae. The majority of Shigellosis cases occurred from June to September.
Potential risk factors related with Shigellosis were unhygienic latrine usage,
bad hand washing, and consumption of unhygienic food and water, and pipe leakage 
in the sewage system. In this study, we have observed a high number of
Shigellosis cases especially those caused by S. flexneri. It is suggested that
effective health awareness programs should be organized by the regional health
authorities to minimize the magnitude of pediatrics Shigellosis.
