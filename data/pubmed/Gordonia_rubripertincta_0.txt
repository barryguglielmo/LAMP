Jellybones and NHagos are bacteriophages that were identified in the host
bacterium Gordonia rubripertincta NRRL B-16540. Jellybones has a direct terminal 
repeat and was assigned to the CS2 subcluster with a length of 77,514 bp. NHagos 
is circularly permuted and was assigned to the DR cluster with a length of
59,580 bp.
