This paper reports the isolation and identification of an acido-thermostable
chitinase (ChiA-Ba43) which was purified, from the culture liquid of Bacillus
altitudinis strain KA15, and characterized. Purification of ChiA-Ba43 produced a 
69.6-fold increase in the specific activity (120,000 U/mg) of the chitinase, with
a yield of 51% using colloidal chitin as substrate. ChiA-Ba43 was found to be a
monomeric protein with a molecular mass of 43,190.05 Da as determined by
MALDI-TOF/MS. N-terminal sequence of the first 27 amino-acids (aa) of ChiA-Ba43
displayed homology to chitinases from other Bacillus species. Interestingly,
ChiA-Ba43 exhibited optimum pH and temperature of 4-5.5 and 85 °C, respectively. 
Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) showed that the final hydrolyzed products of the 
enzyme from chitin-oligosaccharides and colloidal chitin are a mixture of
(GlcNAc)2, (GlcNAc)3, (GlcNAc)4, and (GlcNAc)5, which indicates that ChiA-Ba43
possesses an endo-acting function. More interestingly, compared to ChiA-Mt45,
ChiA-Hh59, Chitodextrinase®, N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase®, and ChiA-65, ChiA-Ba43 
demonstrated a high level of catalytic efficiency and outstanding tolerance
towards various organic solvents. The chiA-Ba43 gene (1332 bp) encoding ChiA-Ba43
(409 aa) was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli strain HB101.
The biochemical properties of the recombinant chitinase (rChiA-Ba43) were
equivalent to those of the natively expressed enzyme. These properties make
ChiA-Ba43 an ideal candidate for industrial bioconversion of chitinous waste.
