The early development of immunity and microbiota in the gut of newborn calves can
have life-long consequences. Gut microbiota and the intestinal barrier interplay 
after birth, establishing a homeostatic state whereby mucosal cells cohabit with 
microorganisms to develop a healthy gut. We hypothesized that postnatal
codevelopment of gut immunity and microbiota could be influenced by early-life
supplementation with live yeast. Starting from birth, calves either received a
daily supplementation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardii CNCM I-1079 (SCB, 10 
× 109 cfu/d, n = 10) in the morning meal for 7 d or no supplementation (n = 10). 
Each animal received 2 adequate colostrum replacer meals at 2 and 12 h of life
(expected total IgG fed = 300 g) before being fed milk replacer twice a day.
Passive transfer of immunity (total protein, IgG, and IgA) through colostrum was 
evaluated and endogenous production of IgA was investigated by measuring
IgA-producing plasma cells, IgA relative gene expression (PIGR and CD79A), and
secretory IgA concentration in the gut. The concentration of targeted microbial
groups was evaluated with quantitative PCR in the gut digesta collected at d 7 of
life. Early SCB supplementation did not impair immunoglobulin absorption and all 
calves had successful passive transfer of immunity (serum IgG concentration >15
mg/mL at d 1 and d 7 of age). Although the expression of IgA relative gene
expression (PIGR and CD79A) was not different, SCB calves had higher secretory
IgA concentrations in the ileum (1.98 ± 0.12 mg/g of dry matter; DM) and colon
(1.45 ± 0.12 mg/g of DM) digesta compared with control animals (1.18 and 0.59 ±
0.12 mg/g of DM, respectively). In addition, the number of IgA-producing plasma
cells were greater in both ileum (2.55 ± 0.40 cells/mm2) and colon (3.03 ± 0.40
cells/mm2) tissues for SCB calves compared with control (respectively 1.00 ± 0.40
and 0.60 ± 0.42 cells/mm2). Endogenous IgA production in the gut of SCB calves
was enhanced, which could make them less prone to pathogen intrusion. In
addition, SCB calves had higher Lactobacillus and tended to have higher
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in the jejunum compared with control calves, which
suggests that SCB supplementation during early-life gut colonization may have a
positive effect in newborn calves. Direct SCB supplementation or the cross-talk
between SCB and bacteria may be responsible for stimulating IgA production and
may play a key role in shaping early colonization in the gut of newborn calves.
