INTRODUCTION: Because active cells present higher abundance of ribosomal RNA
(rRNA) than rDNA (rRNA genes), data obtained with rDNA-based quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and rRNA-based qPCR (RT-qPCR) were correlated to
search for active bacteria after chemomechanical procedures (CMP). In addition,
the ability of both assays to detect bacteria in endodontic samples was
evaluated.
METHODS: Samples were taken from 40 teeth with primary endodontic infections
before (S1) and after CMP (S2). DNA and cDNA (synthetized from RNA) were used as 
templates for qPCR using universal primers for bacteria and species-specific
primers for Bacteroidaceae sp. HOT-272, Cutibacterium acnes, Selenomonas spp.,
and Enterococcus faecalis.
RESULTS: After CMP, there was a drastic reduction in the number of total
bacteria, Selenomonas spp., and E. faecalis, whereas no significant difference
was observed for the levels of Bacteroidaceae sp. HOT-272 and C. acnes. The
concentration of rRNA copies in S2 samples was significantly higher than the
corresponding levels of rDNA for assays targeting total bacteria, Bacteroidaceae 
sp. HOT-272, and C. acnes (P < .05), indicating persistence of active bacteria.
The rDNA-based qPCR presented low sensitivity and high specificity when compared 
with RT-qPCR. For most assays, samples positive for rDNA were also positive for
rRNA (positive predictive value = 100%).
CONCLUSIONS: CMP was effective in reducing levels but not the metabolic activity 
of total bacteria. Bacteroidaceae sp. HOT-272 and C. acnes were active members of
the persistent community. Although less sensitive than RT-qPCR, most rDNA-based
qPCR assays had a low risk of providing false-positive results in
postinstrumentation samples.
