Johne's disease (JD) caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (M.
paratuberculosis) is a chronic infection characterized by the development of
granulomatous enteritis in wild and domesticated ruminants. It is one of the most
significant livestock diseases not only in the USA but also globally, accounting 
for USD 200-500 million losses annually for the USA alone with potential link to 
cases of Crohn's disease in humans. Developing safe and protective vaccines is of
a paramount importance for JD control in dairy cows. The current study evaluated 
the safety, immunity and protective efficacy of a novel live attenuated vaccine
(LAV) candidate with and without an adjuvant in comparison to an inactivated
vaccine. Results indicated that the LAV, irrespective of the adjuvant presence,
induced robust T cell immune responses indicated by proinflammatory cytokine
production such as IFN-γ, IFN-α, TNF-α and IL-17 as well as strong response to
intradermal skin test against M. paratuberculosis antigens. Furthermore, the LAV 
was safe with minimal tissue pathology. Finally, calves vaccinated with
adjuvanted LAV did not shed M. paratuberculosis post-challenge, a much-desired
characteristic of an effective vaccine against JD. Together, this data suggests a
strong potential of testing LAV in field trials to curb JD in dairy herds.
