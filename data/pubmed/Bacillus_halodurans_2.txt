Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) longer than 200 nucleotides are rare in bacteria, likely 
because bacterial genomes are under strong evolutionary pressures to maintain a
small genome size. Of the long ncRNAs unique to bacteria, the OLE (ornate, large,
extremophilic) RNA class is among the largest and most structurally complex. OLE 
RNAs form a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex by partnering with at least two
proteins, OapA and OapB, that directly bind OLE RNA. The biochemical functions of
the OLE RNP complex remain unknown, but are required for proper adaptation to
certain environmental stresses, such as cold temperatures, short chain alcohols, 
and high magnesium concentrations. In the current study, we used electrophoretic 
mobility shift assays to examine the binding of OLE RNA fragments by OapB and
found that OapB recognizes a small subregion of OLE RNA, including stem P13, with
a dissociation constant (KD ) of ∼700 pm Analyses with mutated RNA constructs,
and the application of in vitro selection, revealed that strong binding of OLE
RNA by OapB requires a stem containing a precisely located single-nucleotide
bulge and a GNRA tetraloop. Although the vast majority of bacteria with the ole
gene also have the oapB gene, there are many whose genomes contain oapB but lack 
ole, suggesting that OapB has other RNA partners in some species that might
exhibit similar structural features.
