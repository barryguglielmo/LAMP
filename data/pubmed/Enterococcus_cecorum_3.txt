The application of nanoparticles rose steeply in the last decade, where they have
become a common ingredient used in processed human food, improving food
properties such as shelf life and appearance. Nanoparticles have also attracted
considerable interest to the livestock industry, due to their efficacy in
intestinal pathogen control, with the regulatory and consumer driven push for the
removal of antibiotic growth promoters. The influence of selenium (Se)
nanoparticles was investigated on a diverse and mature broiler caecal microbiota 
using in vitro culturing and 16S rRNA gene sequencing methods for microbiota
characterisation. Caecal microbiota was collected from 4 traditionally grown
heritage roosters and grown for 48 h, in the presence and absence of Se
nanoparticles, with 2 technical replicates each. The effect of rooster as a
biological variable strongly overpowered the effects of nano-Se in the media,
resulting in moderate effects on the structure and diversity of the caecal
microbial community. However the nanoparticles showed a significant reduction
(P < 0.05) in the abundance of an emerging poultry pathogen, Enterococcus cecorum
identical operational taxonomic units (OTU), which could be of notable interest
in poultry production for targeted E. cecorum control without significant
disturbance to the total microbial community.
