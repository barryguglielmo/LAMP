A 54-year-old man was admitted to our institute with a diagnosis of infectious
endocarditis with vegetation on the mitral valve and severe regurgitation due to 
Gemella morbillorum infection together with renal dysfunction, which was
eventually diagnosed as infection-related pauci-immune necrotizing crescentic
glomerulonephritis. Given the refractoriness to antibiotics, the persistent
activity of nephritis, and repeated cerebral hemorrhaging, we prioritized steroid
therapy over early surgical mitral valve replacement. Following steroid therapy, 
the glomerulonephritis completely improved. Although the administration of
steroid therapy in the active phase of infectious endocarditis remains
controversial, it might be indicated if comorbid glomerulonephritis is critical.
