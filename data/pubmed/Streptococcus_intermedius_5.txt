BACKGROUND: The extent of surgery required in the management of pediatric
non-medial subperiosteal orbital abscess (SPOA) due to medically refractory
complicated acute sinusitis is unknown.
OBJECTIVES: The primary objective is to compare operative outcomes of children
treated with combined endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) and external orbital
drainage (EOD) versus those treated with EOD alone.
METHODS: Retrospective case series from a tertiary children's hospital analyzing 
outcomes in children requiring surgical management for acute sinusitis
complicated by non-medial SPOA between November 2007 and September 2019.
RESULTS: Sixteen children with a mean age of 9.4â€‰years (95% CI: 7.3-11.4) met
inclusion. Eleven (68.8%) underwent combined EOD and ESS, while five (31.2%)
underwent EOD alone. Groups were similar in age, symptom duration, white blood
cell count, C-reactive protein level, intraocular pressure, Lund-Mackay score,
and abscess volume. There was no significant difference in median length of stay 
between patients treated with a combined approach versus those treated by EOD
alone. Cultures identified non-beta-hemolytic Streptococcus species in 56.3% of
patients, with Streptococcus intermedius representing the most common organism in
37.5%. In one case, ESS identified a pathogen not acquired via concomitant EOD,
which did influence management. No child required a subsequent surgical procedure
and there were no operative complications.
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of ESS in the management of pediatric non-medial SPOA
was not associated with a statistically different duration of hospitalization.
Cultures from concomitant ESS rarely aided in diagnosis or antibiotic therapy.
Further study should delineate the indications for ESS in these cases.
