BACKGROUND: Globally, colorectal cancer (CRC) affects more than 1 million people 
each year. In addition to non-modifiable and other environmental risk factors,
Fusobacterium nucleatum infection has been linked to CRC recently. In this study,
we explored mechanisms underlying the role of Fusobacterium nucleatum infection
in the progression of CRC in a mouse model.
METHODS: C57BL/6 J-Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) Min/J mice [APC (Min/+)] were
treated with Fusobacterium nucleatum (109 cfu/mL, 0.2 mL/time/day, i.g.,
12 weeks), saline, or FadA knockout (FadA-/-) Fusobacterium nucleatum. The
number, size, and weight of CRC tumors were determined in isolated tumor masses. 
The human CRC cell lines HCT29 and HT116 were treated with lentiviral vectors
overexpressing chk2 or silencing β-catenin. DNA damage was determined by Comet
assay and γH2AX immunofluorescence assay and flow cytometry. The mRNA expression 
of chk2 was determined by RT-qPCR. Protein expression of FadA, E-cadherin,
β-catenin, and chk2 were determined by Western blot analysis.
RESULTS: Fusobacterium nucleatum treatment promoted DNA damage in CRC in APC
(Min/+) mice. Fusobacterium nucleatum also increased the number of CRC cells that
were in the S phase of the cell cycle. FadA-/- reduced tumor number, size, and
burden in vivo. FadA-/- also reduced DNA damage, cell proliferation, expression
of E-cadherin and chk2, and cells in the S phase. Chk2 overexpression elevated
DNA damage and tumor growth in APC (Min/+) mice.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this study provided evidence that Fusobacterium
nucleatum induced DNA damage and cell growth in CRC through FadA-dependent
activation of the E-cadherin/β-catenin pathway, leading to up-regulation of chk2.
