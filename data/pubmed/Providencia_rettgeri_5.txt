We report results of the studies relating to improved stability (40 days) of
small sized microbial fuel cell (MFC) fabricated using agarose embedded
paper-based proton exchange membrane. A fermentative bacterium Providencia
rettgeri was isolated from rotten potato slurry and identified by 16S rRNA
sequencing. The electroactivity of the bacteria was monitored via
chronoamperometric and cyclic voltammetric studies using a three-electrode system
which indicated the presence of bacterial redox mediator. The Matrix-Assisted
Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) and UV-Vis absorption
spectroscopy provided the evidence that Providencia rettgeri synthesized folate
(vitamin B9) during fermentation that was found to act for the first time as a
redox mediator in an MFC. The paper based designed MFC fed with Providencia
rettgeri yielded open circuit voltage of 787.9 mV with power and current density 
of 5.02 W/m3 and 11.26 A/m3, respectively when measured across 10 kΩ. The
microbial re-chargeable battery comprising of an assembly of parallelly aligned
four units of MFCs when connected in series (total 16 MFCs), generated 1.5 V that
was used for powering a red-light emitting device (LED).
