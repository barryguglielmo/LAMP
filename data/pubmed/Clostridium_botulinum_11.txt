BACKGROUND: Gene expression profile analysis on mammalian cell lines and animal
models after exposure to botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) has been investigated in
several studies in recent years. Microarray analysis provides a powerful tool for
identifying critical signaling pathways involved in the biological and
inflammatory responses to BoNT and helps determine the mechanism of the function 
of botulinum toxins. One of the pivotal clinical characteristics of BoNT is its
prolonged on-site effects. The role of BoNT on the blockage of neurotransmitter
acetylcholine release in the neuromuscular junction has been well established.
However, the effects of the treatment time of BoNT on the human cellular model
and its potential mechanism remain to be defined.
METHODS: This study aimed to use gene microarray technology to compare the two
physiological critical time points of BoNT type A (BoNT/A) treatment of human
neuroblastoma cells and to advance our understanding of the profound biological
influences that toxin molecules play in the neuronal cellular system. SH-SY5Y
neuroblastoma cells were treated with BoNT/A for 4 and 48 h, which represent the 
time needed for the entrance of toxin into the cells and the time necessary for
the initial appearance of the on-site effects after BoNT application,
respectively.
RESULTS: A comparison of the two time points identified 122 functional groups
that are significantly changed. The top five groups are alternative splicing,
phosphoprotein, nucleus, cytoplasm, and acetylation. Furthermore, after 48 h,
there were 744 genes significantly up-regulated, and 624 genes significantly
down-regulated (p‹ 0.01). These genes fell into the following neurological and
biological annotation groups: Nervous system development, proteinaceous
extracellular matrix, signaling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells,
cellular function and signal transduction, and apoptosis. We have also noticed
that the up-regulated groups contained neuronal cell development, nervous system 
development, and metabolic processes. In contrast, the down-regulated groups
contained many chromosomes and cell cycle categories.
CONCLUSIONS: The effects of BoNT/A on neuronal cells extend beyond blocking the
neurotransmitter release, and that BoNT/A is a multifunctional molecule that can 
evoke profound cellular responses which warrant a more in-depth understanding of 
the mechanism of the toxin's effects after administration.
