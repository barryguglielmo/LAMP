Some rice bran pickles contain histamine (Him) and tyramine (Tym), which are
nonvolatile amines, presumably produced by microorganisms during the fermentation
process. When attempting to identify the histamine- and tyramine-producing
bacteria from commercially available cucumber rice bran pickles containing Him
and Tym, it was identified histamine-producing bacteria were found to be
Raoultella ornithinolytica, and tyramine-producing bacteria were Lactobacillus
curvatus. When those bacteria were cultured in media containing rice bran (the
raw material for rice bran pickles), Him and Tym were produced. However, it was
suggested that Him and Tym were not necessarily produced by the presence or
absence of amine-producing bacteria, but rather, their production was affected by
the amount of precursor amino acids and other bacteria that were present during
rice bran pickles production.
