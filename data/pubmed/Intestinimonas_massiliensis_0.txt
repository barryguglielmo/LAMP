Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic and debilitating
functional gastrointestinal disorder affecting 9%-23% of the population across
the world. The relative efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on IBS
symptoms was demonstrated in a double-blind, randomized study.
Methods: We describe the case of a 73-year-old woman suffering from IBS
(abdominal pain, bloating, and abundant and disabling diarrhea, with 10-15 stools
a day) and repetitive urinary tract infection (UTI; 5 episodes in 6 months,
including 3 the last 2 months) for several years, generating an impaired quality 
of life. She received an FMT with 400 mL of fecal infusion from a healthy donor
via a nasogastric tube after bowel lavage. Her digestive microbiota was analyzed 
using culturomic and metagenomic targeting 16S rRNA sequencing methods.
Results: Eight months after transplantation, we observed a significant reduction 
in frequency and improvement in stool consistency (3-4 molded stools a day
against 10-15 before the transplant) and no recurrence of urinary infection (as
previously reported). Using culturomics, we found 12 bacteria present in the
fecal infusion and post-transplant stool; these were absent pretransplant. Three 
of them (Intestinimonas massiliensis, Oscillibacter massiliensis, and
Provencibacter massiliensis) were previously discovered and cultivated in our
laboratory using culturomics. Using metagenomics, we also observed 12 bacteria,
different from those observed during culture, that could have been transferred to
the patient by FMT.
Conclusions: In this case report, IBS symptoms and UTI frequency decreased after 
FMT UTI. Further studies involving more patients would be relevant to confirm
this work and develop bacteriotherapy.
