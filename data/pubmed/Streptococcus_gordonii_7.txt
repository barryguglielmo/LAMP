The objectives were to investigate a novel combination of gene-knockout with
antimicrobial dimethylaminohexadecyl methacrylate (DMAHDM) composite in
regulating oral biofilm from a cariogenic state toward a non-cariogenic state. A 
tri-species biofilm model included cariogenic Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans),
and non-cariogenic Streptococcus sanguinis (S. sanguinis) and Streptococcus
gordonii (S. gordonii). Biofilm colony-forming-units (CFUs), lactic acid and
polysaccharide production were measured. TaqMan real-time-polymerase-chain
reaction was used to determine the percentage of each species in biofilm. The rnc
gene-knockout for S. mutans with DMAHDM composite reduced biofilm CFU by five
logs, compared to control (p < 0.05). Using parent S. mutans, an overwhelming S. 
mutans percentage of 68.99% and 69.00% existed in biofilms on commercial
composite and 0% DMAHDM composite, respectively. In sharp contrast, with a
combination of S. mutans rnc knockout and DMAHDM composite, the cariogenic S.
mutans percentage in biofilm was reduced to only 6.33%. Meanwhile, the
non-cariogenic S. sanguinis + S. gordonii percentage was increased to 93.67%.
Therefore, combining rnc-knockout with bioactive and therapeutic dental composite
achieved the greatest reduction in S. mutans, and the greatest increase in
non-cariogenic species, thereby yielding the least lactic acid-production. This
novel method is promising to obtain wide applications to regulate biofilms and
inhibit dental caries.
