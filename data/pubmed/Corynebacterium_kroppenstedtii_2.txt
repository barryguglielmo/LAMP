Cystic neutrophilic granulomatous mastitis (CNGM) is a histologically
characterized variant of granulomatous lobular mastitis that is associated with
lipophilic Corynebacterium species. It remains a largely underrecognized entity
in India. Our aim was to study CNGM in the Asian Indian population and explore if
16s rRNA sequencing could be used on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissue to identify the causative organism. We studied 24 cases with histological 
features of CNGM with hematoxylin and eosin, Gram, Ziehl-Neelsen, and Periodic
acid-Schiff stains. Tuberculosis-polymerase chain reaction and 16s rRNA gene
sequencing on DNA extracted from FFPE was attempted (N = 23). Gram-positive
bacilli were seen in 20/24 cases. Routine culture with prolonged incubation
yielded Corynebacterium species in 8 cases; 7 of these cases were evaluated by
matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry
(MALDI-TOF MS) for species identification. C matruchotti was identified in one
case by BD Phoenix. MALDI-TOF MS identified the remaining 7 cases as C
kroppenstedtii (N = 4) and C tuberculostearicum (N = 2), with no identification
in one. Corynebacteria were identified by 16s rRNA sequencing on DNA extracted
from FFPE in 12/23 cases using a primer targeting the V5-V6 region that was found
to be more conserved in Corynebacterium species. All cases were negative for the 
diagnosis of tuberculosis. CNGM can be identified by routine stains. Culture
using routine media with prolonged incubation is often adequate to isolate the
organism. 16s rRNA sequencing on DNA extracted from FFPE tissue can help make an 
etiological diagnosis in some cases where only paraffin blocks are available.
