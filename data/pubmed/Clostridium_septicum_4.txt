A 46-year-old male with bilateral metal-on-metal hip prostheses presented with a 
left periprosthetic hip infection, as well as chronic, progressive osteolysis of 
the proximal femur and acetabulum with pelvic erosion. Three years before, the
bearing surface was changed to metal-on-polyethylene prosthesis during an
attempted revision but was complicated by extensive blood loss. At our
institution, gross inspection demonstrated a soft-tissue hip mass of unknown
etiology. Open biopsy and culture were performed, but extensive hemorrhaging
required interventional radiology. Cultures revealed Clostridium septicum
infection-known for its associations with gastrointestinal malignancy. Workup in 
the hospital was negative for malignancy, and definitive management was left hip 
disarticulation and intravenous antibiotics. The patient developed a chronic
wound on the left hip incision but was ultimately lost to follow-up.
