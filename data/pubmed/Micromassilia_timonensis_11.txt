Emerging evidence suggests associations between the vaginal microbiota (VMB)
composition, human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, and cervical intraepithelial
neoplasia (CIN); however, causal inference remains uncertain. Here, we use
bacterial DNA sequencing from serially collected vaginal samples from a cohort of
87 adolescent and young women aged 16-26 years with histologically confirmed,
untreated CIN2 lesions to determine whether VMB composition affects rates of
regression over 24 months. We show that women with a Lactobacillus-dominant
microbiome at baseline are more likely to have regressive disease at 12 months.
Lactobacillus spp. depletion and presence of specific anaerobic taxa including
Megasphaera, Prevotella timonensis and Gardnerella vaginalis are associated with 
CIN2 persistence and slower regression. These findings suggest that VMB
composition may be a future useful biomarker in predicting disease outcome and
tailoring surveillance, whilst it may offer rational targets for the development 
of new prevention and treatment strategies.
