BACKGROUND.: Primary deficit schizophrenia (DS) is characterized by enduring
negative symptoms and represents a qualitatively different disease entity with
respect to non-deficit schizophrenia (NDS). No studies investigated the
association between the enzyme paraoxonase 1 (PON1) and DS and its phenomenology.
METHODS.: In this case-control study, Thai women and men, aged 18 to 65 years,
were divided in DS (n = 40) and NDS (n = 40) and were compared to controls (n =
40). PON1 activities against 4-(chloromethyl)phenyl acetate (CMPA) and
phenylacetate were determined. Moreover, subjects were genotyped for their PON1
Q192R polymorphism and immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels responses directed to
Gram-negative bacteria were measured.
RESULTS.: DS is significantly associated with the QQ genotype and the Q allele as
compared with NDS and controls. PON1 activities are significantly and inversely
associated with negative symptoms, formal thought disorders, psychomotor
retardation, excitation and DS. The presence of the Q allele is associated with
increased IgA responses to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, and
Pseudomonas putida as compared with RR carriers.
CONCLUSIONS.: The PON1 Q allele and lower PON1 activities especially against CMPA
are associated with DS, indicating lowered quorum quenching abilities as well as 
lowered defenses against lipoperoxidation and immune activation. It is suggested 
that lowered PON1 activity in DS constitutes an impairment in the innate immune
system which together with lowered natural IgM may cause lower immune regulation 
thereby predisposing toward greater neurotoxic effects of immune-inflammatory,
oxidative and nitrosative pathways and Gram-negative microbiota.
