Citrobacter species are opportunistic bacterial pathogens that have been
implicated in both nosocomial and community-acquired infections. Among the genus 
Citrobacter, Citrobacter koseri is often isolated from clinical material, and has
been known to cause meningitis and brain abscess in neonates and
immunocompromised individuals. The virulence determinants of Citrobacter,
however, remain largely unknown. Based on traditional methods, the genus
Citrobacter has been divided into 11 species, but this has been problematic.
Here, we determined an improved, detailed, and more accurate phylogeny of the
genus Citrobacter based on whole genome sequence (WGS) data from 129 Citrobacter 
genomes, 31 of which were sequenced in this study. A maximum likelihood (ML)
phylogeny constructed with core genome single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
classified all Citrobacter isolates into 11 distinct groups, with all C. koseri
strains clustering into a single group. For comprehensive and systematic
comparative genomic analyses, we investigated the distribution of virulence
factors, resistance genes, and macromolecular secretion systems among the
Citrobacter genus. Moreover, combined with group-specific genes analysis, we
identified a key gene cluster for iron transport, which is present in the C.
koseri group, but absent in other the groups, suggesting that the
high-pathogenicity island (HPI) cluster may be important for the pathogenicity of
C. koseri. Animal experiments showed that loss of the HPI cluster significantly
decreased C. koseri virulence in mice and rat. Further, we provide evidence to
explain why Citrobacter freundii is less susceptible than C. koseri to several
antibiotics in silico. Overall, our data reveal novel virulence clusters specific
to the predominantly pathogenic C. koseri strains, which form the basis for
elucidating the virulence mechanisms underlying these important pathogens.
