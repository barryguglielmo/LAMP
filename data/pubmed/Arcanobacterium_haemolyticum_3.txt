We report a rare case of post-traumatic cutaneous diphtheria in a patient
referred from a hospital in rural India. The diagnosis of cutaneous diphtheria
was confirmed by the isolation of Corynebacterium diphtheriae cultured from the
ulcer of the leg, along with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and
Arcanobacterium haemolyticum. The patient was kept on isolation and treated with 
erythromycin for 14 days without antitoxin. He was discharged when his subsequent
cultures turned out to be negative. Chemoprophylaxis was also given to his family
members. Such a case highlights the revisiting of vaccination strategies and the 
role of cutaneous carriers in transmission of this deadly disease.
