Purulent pericarditis caused by Streptococcus anginosus is extremely rare. A
66-year-old man underwent elective coronary artery bypass surgery. This was
complicated by sternal wound dehiscence with drainage. Subsequently, he developed
fever, progressive dyspnoea and presyncope. Echocardiography showed a large
pericardial effusion with evidence of tamponade. He underwent emergent
pericardiocentesis. The pericardial fluid culture grew S. anginosus He was
treated with 4 weeks of intravenous ceftriaxone with complete clinical recovery. 
The source of infection was most likely the sternal wound which was overlooked
during debridement and rewiring surgery.
