OBJECTIVE: To determine whether four isolates of Streptococcus canis (S canis)
recovered from dogs diagnosed with ulcerative keratitis at the Animal Health
Trust (AHT) were genetically related to other ocular isolates that are registered
in the online database.
ANIMAL STUDIED: Four S canis corneal isolates.
PROCEDURES: Clinical and laboratory records between 2016 and 2017 were searched
for dogs with ulcerative keratitis for which microbiology analysis was consistent
with the growth of S canis. Genomic DNA was extracted for sequencing (Illumina
MiSeq), and multilocus sequence types (STs) were determined using MLST 1.8
relative to the 44 sequence types of S canis available. A neighbor-joining tree
was constructed in MEGA v4.0. A two-sided Fisher's exact test was used to
determine any associations between the isolated strains and ocular infections of 
dogs.
RESULTS: Four strains were isolated from pugs (cases 1-4) with ulcerative
keratitis. Genome sequencing identified ST-27 (case 1), ST-9 (case 3), and ST-13 
(cases 2 and 4). STs 13 and 27 are members of Clonal Complex (CC)-13. Analysis of
the multilocus sequence typing database revealed that CC-13 strains accounted for
six of the twelve isolates recovered from the eye exudates of dogs (P = .0078).
CONCLUSIONS: There is early evidence that the CC-13 group of S canis is
associated with ocular infections in dogs. We provide draft genome sequences
toward the future identification of virulence mechanisms associated with
streptococcal keratitis in dogs.
