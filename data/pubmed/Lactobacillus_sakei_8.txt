BACKGROUND: To evaluate the immunomodulatory effect of Lactobacillus sakei in a
mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and in human immune cells.
METHODS: We evaluated whether L. sakei reduced the severity of collagen-induced
arthritis (CIA) and modulated interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-10 levels, as well as
whether it affected the differentiation of CD4+ T cells and regulatory B cells.
We evaluated osteoclastogenesis after culturing bone marrow-derived mononuclear
cells with L. sakei.
RESULTS: The differentiation of T helper 17 cells and the serum level of IL-17
were suppressed by L. sakei in both human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and 
mouse splenocytes. The serum level of IL-10 was significantly increased in the L.
sakei-treated group, whereas the regulatory T cell population was unchanged. The 
population of regulatory B cells significantly increased the in L. sakei-treated 
group. Oral administration of L. sakei reduced the arthritis incidence and score 
in mice with CIA. Finally, osteoclastogenesis and the mRNA levels of
osteoclast-related genes were suppressed in the L. sakei-treated group.
CONCLUSION: L. sakei exerted an anti-inflammatory effect in an animal model of
RA, regulated Th17 and regulatory B cell differentiation, and suppressed
osteoclastogenesis. Our findings suggest that L. sakei has therapeutic potential 
for RA.
