While there is strong evidence showing that many food-borne probiotics regulate
cholesterol metabolism, few studies have examined how probiotics of human origin 
affect cholesterol metabolism. Because people living in so-called 'longevity
villages' are unlikely to have hypercholesterolemia, we hypothesized that
probiotics isolated from the residents would have cholesterol-reducing effects on
rats with hypercholesterolemia. We isolated 16 strains of Lactobacillus from four
longevity populations in China. The strains were tested in vitro for bile salt
hydrolase (BSH) activity and two isolates, Lactobacillus reuteri A9 and
Lactobacillus mucosae A13, were screened out. These two strains were then
administered daily for 28 d to rats fed a cholesterol-rich diet. The serum total 
cholesterol levels in the L. reuteri A9 and L. mucosae A13 groups decreased by
24.3% and 21.6%, respectively. The serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol
levels decreased by 23.8% and 25.2%, respectively. The L. reuteri A9 and L.
mucosae A13 groups also exhibited upregulated hepatic mRNA expression of Sterol
regulatory element-binding protein 2 (Srebp2) by 2.71-fold and 2.54-fold,
respectively. The mRNA expression levels of hepatic low-density lipoprotein
receptor (Ldlr) in the two groups were significantly up-regulated by 1.28-fold
and 2.17-fold, respectively. The composition of gut microbiota was recovered by
oral gavage in both experimental groups, and the destroyed diversity of gut
microbiota was relieved.
