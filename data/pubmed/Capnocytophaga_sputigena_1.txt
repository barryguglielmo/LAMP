AIM: Periodontitis has been identified as a moderate but independent risk factor 
for cardiovascular (CV) disease and progression. The objective of this study
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01045070) was to assess subgingival
colonization with selected periodontal pathogens on the occurrence of further
adverse CV events in a cohort of CV patients.
METHODS: The prevalence of severe periodontitis including the detection of 11
periodontal pathogens (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas
gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola,
P. intermdia, Peptostreptococcus micros, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter
rectus, Eubacterium nodatum, Eikenella corrodens, Capnocytophaga sputigena,
Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Capnocytophaga ochracea; HAIN-Diagnostica® ) was
analysed in 1,002 CV patients The prognostic impact of periodontal pathogens for 
combined CV endpoint (stroke/TIA, myocardial infarction, CV death, death from
stroke) was evaluated after a 3-year follow-up period. Hazard ratios (HRs) were
adjusted for established CV risk factors applying Cox regression.
RESULTS: In the Kaplan-Meier analysis (log-rank test: p < .001) and Cox
regression (HR: 0.545, 95%-CI: 0.387-0.773; p = .001), the decreased occurrence
of E. corrodens was shown to be an independent predictor for adverse CV events
after 3 years of follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The detection of E. corrodens was associated with a reduced risk of 
adverse CV events in patients with CV disease. The pathophysiological background 
underlying this association should be investigated in further studies.
