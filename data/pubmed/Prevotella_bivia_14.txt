We aimed to analyze the strain-by-strain expression of a large panel of
antimicrobial activities counteracting the virulence mechanisms of bacterial
vaginosis-associated Prevotella bivia CI-1 and Gardnerella vaginalis 594,
pyelonephritis-associated Escherichia coli CFT073, and recurrent cystitis- and
preterm labor-associated IH11128 E. coli by Lactobacillus gasseri and
Lactobacillus crispatus clinical strains, and L. gasseri ATCC 9857 and KS 120.1, 
and L. crispatus CTV-05 strains isolated from the cervicovaginal microbiota of
healthy women. All L. gasseri and L. crispatus strains exerted antimicrobial
activity by secreted lactic acid, which killed the microbial pathogens by direct 
contact. Potent bactericidal activity was exerted by a very limited number of
resident L. gasseri and L. crispatus strains showing the specific ability to a
strain to produce and release antibiotic-like compounds. These compounds
eradicated the microbial pathogens pre-associated with the surface of cervix
epithelial cells, providing efficient protection of the cells against the
deleterious effects triggered by toxin-producing G. vaginalis and uropathogenic
E. coli. Furthermore, these compounds crossed the cell membrane to kill the
pre-internalized microbial pathogens. In addition, all L. gasseri and L.
crispatus cells exhibited another non-strain specific activity which inhibited
the association of microbial pathogens with cervix epithelial cells with varying 
efficiency, partially protecting the cells against lysis and detachment triggered
by toxin-producing G. vaginalis and uropathogenic E. coli. Our results provide
evidence of strain-level specificity for certain antimicrobial properties among
cervicovaginal L. gasseri and L. crispatus strains, indicating that the presence 
of a particular species in the vaginal microbiota is not sufficient to determine 
its benefit to the host. A full repertory of antimicrobial properties should be
evaluated in choosing vaginal microbiota-associated Lactobacillus isolates for
the development of live biotherapeutic strategies.
