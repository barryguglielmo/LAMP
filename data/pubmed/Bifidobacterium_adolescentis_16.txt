PURPOSE: Compared to a healthy population, the gut microbiota in type 2 diabetes 
presents with several unfavourable features that may impair glucose regulation.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the prebiotic effect of inulin-type
fructans on the faecal microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in patients 
with type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: The study was a placebo controlled crossover study, where 25 patients
(15 men) aged 41-71 years consumed 16 g of inulin-type fructans (a mixture of
oligofructose and inulin) and 16-g placebo (maltodextrin) for 6 weeks in
randomised order. A 4-week washout separated the 6 weeks treatments. The faecal
microbiota was analysed by high-throughput 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and SCFA 
in faeces were analysed using vacuum distillation followed by gas chromatography.
RESULTS: Treatment with inulin-type fructans induced moderate changes in the
faecal microbiota composition (1.5%, p = 0.045). A bifidogenic effect was most
prominent, with highest positive effect on operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of 
Bifidobacterium adolescentis, followed by OTUs of Bacteroides. Significantly
higher faecal concentrations of total SCFA, acetic acid and propionic acid were
detected after prebiotic consumption compared to placebo. The prebiotic fibre had
no effects on the concentration of butyric acid or on the overall microbial
diversity.
CONCLUSION: Six weeks supplementation with inulin-type fructans had a significant
bifidogenic effect and induced increased concentrations of faecal SCFA, without
changing faecal microbial diversity. Our findings suggest a moderate potential of
inulin-type fructans to improve gut microbiota composition and to increase
microbial fermentation in type 2 diabetes.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02569684).
