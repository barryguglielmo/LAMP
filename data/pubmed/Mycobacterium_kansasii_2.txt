RATIONALE: Although gastric aspirate culture is utilized for diagnosing pulmonary
tuberculosis, its usefulness in diagnosing pulmonary infections of
non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the diagnostic validity of gastric aspirate culture for
acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in NTM-pulmonary disease (NTM-PD).
METHODS: Gastric aspirates were collected from patients with suspected NTM-PD at 
the Osaka Toneyama Medical Center between December 2006 and February 2018.
Patients with a final diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis, an observation period 
less than six months, or less than three conducted sputum cultures were excluded 
from the study. NTM-PD was diagnosed as per ATS/IDSA criteria. We retrospectively
examined the diagnostic validity of gastric aspirate culture in Mycobacterium
avium complex (MAC)-PD and M. kansasii-PD by comparing culture results with final
diagnoses. This was done first for all patients, and subsequently for patients
with negative results for early sputum cultures. In addition, we compared the
time required for an NTM-PD diagnosis based on gastric aspiration to that based
on ATS/IDSA criteria.
RESULTS: Among 475 total patients, 119 (25.1%) had positive NTM gastric aspirate 
cultures and 154 (32.4%) fulfilled the ATS/IDSA criteria for NTM-PD. The
sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative
predictive values (NPVs) of gastric aspiration were 63.9%, 95.8%, 83.5%, and
88.8% in MAC-PD and 82.4%, 99.6%, 87.5%, and 99.3% in M. kansasii-PD,
respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of gastric aspirate cultures
of the 378 patients who were undiagnosed based on sputum culture within 120 days 
were 34.0%, 95.5%, 51.6%, and 91.1% for MAC-PD and 75.0%, 99.5%, 60.0%, and 99.7%
for M. kansasii-PD, respectively. Furthermore, gastric aspirate cultures tested
in addition to bronchoscopy yielded incremental sensitivity of 8.7% (95.7% vs.
87.0%) and an NPV of 1.3% (99.3% vs. 98.0%) in MAC-PD. In NTM-PD patients with
NTM-positive gastric aspirate cultures, the period between gastric aspirate
collection and the positive culture result was shorter than the time between
gastric aspirate collection and NTM-PD diagnosis [6 (9, 36) days vs. 25 (12, 69) 
days, median (IQR), p < 0.0001].
CONCLUSIONS: In settings where AFB pulmonary diseases are suspected, gastric
aspirate culture may be helpful for diagnosing MAC-PD and M. kansasii-PD.
