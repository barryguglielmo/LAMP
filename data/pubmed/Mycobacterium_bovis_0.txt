Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) represents a growing problem for
global healthcare systems. In addition to 1.3 million deaths in 2018, the World
Health Organisation reported 484,000 new cases of MDR-TB. Isoniazid is a key
anti-TB drug that inhibits InhA, a crucial enzyme in the cell wall biosynthesis
pathway and identical in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. bovis. Isoniazid is a 
pro-drug which requires activation by the enzyme KatG, mutations in KatG prevent 
activation and confer INH-resistance. 'Direct inhibitors' of InhA are attractive 
as they would circumvent the main clinically observed resistance mechanisms. A
library of new 1,5-triazoles, designed to mimic the structures of both triclosan 
molecules uniquely bound to InhA have been synthesised. The inhibitory activity
of these compounds was evaluated using isolated enzyme assays with 2
(5-chloro-2-(4-(5-(((4-(4-chloro-2-hydroxyphenoxy)benzyl)oxy)methyl)-1H-1,2,3-tri
azol-1-yl)phenoxy)phenol) exhibiting an IC50 of 5.6 µM. Whole-cell evaluation was
also performed, with 11
(5-chloro-2-(4-(5-(((4-(cyclopropylmethoxy)benzyl)oxy)methyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-
yl)phenoxy)phenol) showing the greatest potency, with an MIC99 of 12.9 µM against
M. bovis.
