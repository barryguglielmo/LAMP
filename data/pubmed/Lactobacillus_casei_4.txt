The study aimed at the development of a sufficient technology to improve sensory,
textural, physical, and microbiological properties of peas snacks (Ps) using
solid-state fermentation (SSF) and submerged fermentation (SMF) with two
different lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains (Lactobacillus casei LUHS210 and
Lactobacillus uvarum LUHS245) for 24 hr and ultrasonication (10, 20, and 30 min).
To ensure safety of the used technologies, microbiological characteristics and
biogenic amines (BAs) content in treated Ps were analyzed. Additionally, a
different salt content (3.6 and 1.0 g/100 g) was used for snacks preparation. The
obtained results revealed that used treatments reduced enterobacteria in Ps,
while in fermented Ps, yeast/moulds were not found. Ps with the lower salt
content were more acidic and harder (0.90 mJ), and there was a significant effect
(p < .05) due to the fermentation method, LAB strains, and ultrasonication on the
texture of final product. Different salt content significantly affected the color
coordinates of the Ps tested (p < .05). The predominant biogenic amines in Ps
were phenylethylamine and spermidine. However, the reduction of some BAs after
samples fermentation was observed. To conclude, acceptable formulations of Ps can
be obtained with 1.0 g/100 g salt, and by using fermentation, as the end-product 
is more attractive to consumers than those prepared with 3.6 g/100 g salt and
using ultrasonication.
