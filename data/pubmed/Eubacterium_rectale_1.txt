Bacterial degradation of the sugar sulfoquinovose (SQ, 6-deoxy-6-sulfoglucose)
produced by plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, is an important component of the
biogeochemical carbon and sulfur cycles. Here, we reveal a third biochemical
pathway for primary SQ degradation in an aerobic Bacillus aryabhattai strain. An 
isomerase converts SQ to 6-deoxy-6-sulfofructose (SF). A novel transaldolase
enzyme cleaves the SF to 3-sulfolactaldehyde (SLA), while the non-sulfonated
C3-(glycerone)-moiety is transferred to an acceptor molecule, glyceraldehyde
phosphate (GAP), yielding fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). Intestinal anaerobic
bacteria such as Enterococcus gilvus, Clostridium symbiosum, and Eubacterium
rectale strains also express transaldolase pathway gene clusters during
fermentative growth with SQ. The now three known biochemical strategies for SQ
catabolism reflect adaptations to the aerobic or anaerobic lifestyle of the
different bacteria. The occurrence of these pathways in intestinal (family)
Enterobacteriaceae and (phylum) Firmicutes strains further highlights a potential
importance of metabolism of green-diet SQ by gut microbial communities to,
ultimately, hydrogen sulfide.
