Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in the United States.

BACKGROUND: Risk of tuberculosis (TB) declines over time since Mycobacterium
tuberculosis infection, but progression to clinical disease is still possible
decades later. In the United States, most TB cases result from progression of
latent TB infection (LTBI) acquired over 2 years ago.
METHODS: We synthesized evidence on TB natural history and incidence trends using
a transmission-dynamic model. For the 2020 US population, we estimated average
time since infection and annual, cumulative, and remaining lifetime risks of
progression to TB, by nativity and age.
RESULTS: For a newly infected adult with no other risk factors for progression to
TB, estimated rates of progression declined from 38 [95% uncertainty interval:
33, 46] to 0.38 [0.32, 0.45] per 1000 person-years between the 1st and 25th year 
since infection. Cumulative risk over the 25 years from new infection was 7.9%
[7.0, 8.9]. In 2020, estimated average age of individuals with prevalent
infection was 62 [61,63] for the US-born population, 55 [54, 55] for non-US-born,
and 57 [56, 58] overall. Average risks of developing TB over the remaining
lifetime were 1.2% [1.0, 1.4] for US-born, 2.2% [1.8, 2.6] for non-US-born, and
1.9% [1.6, 2.2] for the general population. Risk estimates were higher for
younger age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that, while newly infected individuals face
appreciable lifetime TB risks, most US individuals with LTBI were infected long
ago, and face low future risks of developing TB. Better approaches are needed for
identifying recently infected individuals and those with elevated progression
risks.
