The important physiological and pathophysiological roles of intestinal human
microbiome (HMB) in human health have been emerging, owing to the access to
molecular biology techniques. Herein we evaluated, for the first time, the
intestinal HMB through direct hybridization approach using n-counter flex DX
technology which bypasses the amplification procedure currently applied by other 
technologies to study the human microbiome. To this purpose, a clinical study was
carried out on fecal samples, recruiting both healthy volunteers (N-FOB) and
subjects positive for occult blood (P-FOB). A relevant custom panel of 79 16S
rRNA target gene was engineered and 32 of them displayed a variation between the 
two clusters of subjects. Our findings revealed that bacteria belonging to
Proteobacteria have higher distribution in P-FOB describing dysbiosis. Similarly,
Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phylum display high distribution in P-FOB. Of
interest, the presence of Clostridium difficile that belongs to Firmicutes phylum
displayed about 70% of low presence in N-FOB compared to P-FOB subjects. Only one
bacterium belonging to the Actinobacteria phylum, the Bifidobacterium bifidum,
was present.
