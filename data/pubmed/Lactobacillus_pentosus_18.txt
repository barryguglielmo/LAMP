BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that oral administration of probiotics may 
improve the immune imbalance caused by dysbiosis of the gut microbiome in atopic 
dermatitis (AD). This study aimed to investigate the clinical and immunological
effects of Lactobacillus pentosus in children with mild to moderate AD.
METHODS: Children aged 2-13 years with AD were randomized to receive either 1.0 ×
1010 colony-forming units of L. pentosus or placebo, daily, for 12 weeks. The
clinical severity of AD and transepidermal water loss were evaluated. Blood
eosinophil counts, serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE), and cytokine levels were
measured. The diversity and composition of the gut microbiota were also analyzed.
RESULTS: Eighty-two children were recruited, and 41 were assigned to the
probiotics intervention group. The mean scoring of atopic dermatitis (SCORAD)
indices at baseline were 30.4 and 34.3 for the probiotics and placebo groups,
respectively. At week 12, the mean indices were 23.6 and 23.1 for the probiotics 
and placebo groups, respectively. Clinical severity decreased significantly over 
time in both groups, with no significant difference between the two groups. In
both groups, there were no significant differences in cytokine levels, microbial 
diversity, or the relative abundance of the gut microbiota at week 12 compared
with the corresponding baseline values. The mean subjective scores of SCORAD
indices after intervention for the probiotics group were significantly lower than
those for the placebo group in IgE sensitized AD (P = 0.019).
CONCLUSION: Our results show improved symptoms in the probiotics and placebo
groups, and we could not find additional effects of L. pentosus in AD. However,
the mean subjective scores of SCORAD indices for the probiotics group are
significantly improved compared with those for the placebo group in
allergen-sensitized AD.
