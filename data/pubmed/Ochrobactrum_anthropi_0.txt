The present study was planned to detect the genes encoding carbapenemases, ESBLs 
and class 1 integron-integrase among bacteria obtained from retail goat meat.
Fermenting and non-fermenting bacterial isolates (n = 57), recovered from 61 goat
meat samples, were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Antimicrobial
susceptibility of isolates was tested by the broth dilution method using
ceftazidime, cefotaxime, meropenem and imipenem. Plasmids were isolated and
tested for their physical characters. Plasmids were subjected to screening of
carbapenemase, ESBL and intI1 gene. Conjugation assay was performed using blaNDM 
-positive isolates as the donor, and Escherichia coli HB101 as the recipient.
Isolates showed the high rates of resistance to ceftazidime (77·2%), cefotaxime
(70·2%), meropenem (22·8%) and imipenem (17·5%). They showed variability in
number and size (~1 to >20 kb) of plasmids. Among all, 1, 4, 13 and 31 isolates
showed the blaKPC , blaNDM , blaSHV and blaTEM genes, respectively. The blaKPC-2 
gene was observed in one E. coli isolate. The blaNDM-1 gene was detected in
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 2), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1) and
Ochrobactrum anthropi (n = 1) isolates. These isolates co-harboured the blaTEM
and blaSHV genes. The intI1 gene was detected in 22 (38·6%) isolates, and 16 of
these isolates showed the carbapenemase and/or ESBL genes. The conjugative
movement of blaNDM gene could not be proved after three repetitive mating
experiments. The presence of genes encoding carbapenemases and ESBLs in bacteria 
from goat meat poses public health risks.
