BACKGROUND: The possibility that smokeless tobacco may contribute to oral
carcinogenesis by influencing the oral microbiome has not been explored. This
preliminary cross-sectional study sought to assess the effect of using shammah, a
form of smokeless tobacco prevalent in Arabia, on the tongue microbiome. Tongue
scarping samples were obtained from 29 shammah users (SU; 27.34 ± 6.9 years) and 
23 shammah non-users (SNU; 27.7 ± 7.19 years) and analyzed with 16S rRNA gene
sequencing (V1-V3). Species-level taxonomy assignment of the high-quality, merged
reads was obtained using a previously described BLASTn-based algorithm.
Downstream analyses were performed with QIIME, LEfSe, and R.
RESULTS: A total of 178 species, belonging to 62 genera and 8 phyla were
identified. Genera Streptococcus, Leptotrichia, Actinomyces, Veillonella,
Haemophilus, Prevotella and Neisseria accounted for more than 60% of the average 
microbiome. There were no differences between the two groups in species richness 
and alpha-diversity, but PCoA showed significant separation (P = 0.015, ANOSIM). 
LEfSe analysis identified 22 species to be differentially abundant between the SU
and SNU. However, only 7 species maintained a false discovery rate of ≤0.2 and
could cluster the two groups separately: Rothia mucilaginosa, Streptococcus sp.
oral taxon 66, Actinomyces meyeri, Streptococcus vestibularis Streptococcus
sanguinis and a potentially novel Veillonella species in association with SU, and
Oribacterium asaccharolyticum with SNU.
CONCLUSION: These preliminary results indicate that shammah use induces tongue
microbiome changes including enrichment of several species with high acetaldehyde
production potential, which warrants further investigation.
