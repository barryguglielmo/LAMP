Infections due to bacteria of the genus Paenibacillus are exceedingly rare and
therefore predominately described on a case-by-case basis. Here, we present a
case of a 25-day-old premature neonate who died from presumed Paenibacillus
sepsis and meningitis. Most prior reported cases of Paenibacillus bacteremia were
among patients who had prosthetic medical devices, were immunocompromised, or
were injection drug users. However, to our knowledge, this is the first reported 
case of infant death from presumed Paenibacillus thiaminolyticus. This case
suggests the potential for severe human infection by an environmental bacterium
previously considered to be of little consequence.
