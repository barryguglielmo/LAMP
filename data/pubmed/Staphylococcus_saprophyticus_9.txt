BACKGROUND: Strategies to reduce platelet (PLT) bacterial contamination include
donor screening, skin disinfection, sample diversion, bacterial culture, pathogen
reduction (PR), and day-of-transfusion tests. We report bacterial sepsis
following a pathogen-reduced PLT transfusion.
CASE REPORT: An adult male with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia was
successfully treated for central catheter-associated Staphylococcus aureus
bacteremia. A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) was placed. Chills,
rigors, and flushing developed immediately after PICC-infused pathogen-reduced
PLTs, progressing to septic shock requiring intensive care management.
METHODS: PICC and peripheral blood (PB), transfused bag saline flushes (TBFs),
environmental samples, and the pathogen-reduced untransfused co-component (CC)
were cultured. Plasma metagenomic and bacterial isolate whole-genome sequencing; 
PLT mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) testing of untransfused CC and TBF; CC testing for 
amotosalen (S-59)/S-59 photoproducts; isolate PR studies (INTERCEPT); and TBF
polymerase chain reaction for recipient Y-chromosome DNA were performed.
RESULTS: PB and PICC cultures grew Acinetobacter calcoaceticus/baumannii complex 
(ACBC). TBF was gram-positive; mass spectrometry identified ACBC and
Staphylococcus saprophyticus (SS). CC Gram stain and cultures were negative.
Environmental cultures, some done after decontamination, were ACBC/SS negative.
Posttransfusion patient plasma and TBF ACBC sequences were genetically identical.
No Y-chromosome signal was detected in TBF. S-59 photoproducts and evidence of
mtDNA amplification inhibition were found in the CC. Spiking PR studies showed
>5.9-log inactivation for both isolates. Donor skin cultures for Acinetobacter
were negative.
CONCLUSION: CC sterility, PR studies, residual S-59 photoproducts, and mtDNA
amplification inhibition suggest successful PR. Unidentified environmental
sources and inherent or acquired bag defects may have contributed to
postmanufacturing pathogen-reduced PLT contamination.
