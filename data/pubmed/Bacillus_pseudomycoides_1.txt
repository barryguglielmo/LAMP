A new approach for easy synthesis of Bacillus pseudomycoides immobilized
polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/glutaraldehyde (GA) hydrogel for application in a
wastewater treatment system is reported. Optimization studies revealed that
GA/PVA mass ratio of 0.03 and acidic pH of 2 were required for hydrogel synthesis
and eventually for bacterial cell immobilization. The synthesized crosslinked
matrix possessed a pore size suitable for microbial cell entrapment while
maintaining cell accessibility to external environment for bioremediation.
Possible crosslinking and bacterial cell immobilization in the hydrogel were
evidenced by FTIR, XRD, and SEM studies, respectively. Further, the extent of
crosslinking of GA with PVA was investigated and confirmed by transmittance and
permeability experiments. The viability and proliferation of hydrogel embedded
cells (after 25 days) was confirmed by confocal fluorescence microscopy which
also indicated that acidic pH of polymer solution did not affect the immobilized 
live cells. B. pseudomycoides immobilized hydrogel were demonstrated to be
effective for treatment of municipal wastewater and reduced biochemical oxygen
demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and protein content below the
recommended levels. Overall, the results from this bench-scale work show that
employing bacteria-embedded PVA/GA hydrogel for the treatment of municipal
wastewater yield promising results which should be further explored in
pilot/field-scale studies.
