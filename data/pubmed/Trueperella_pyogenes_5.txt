Our objectives were to describe and compare the uterine bacterial composition of 
postpartum Holstein cows diagnosed as healthy (n = 8), subclinical endometritis
(SCE; n = 8), or clinical endometritis (CE; n = 5) in the fifth week postpartum. 
We did metagenomic analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences from endometrial cytobrush
samples at 10, 21, and 35 days in milk (DIM), and endometrial bacterial culture
at 35 DIM. Uterine bacterial composition in healthy, SCE, and CE was stable at
10, 21, and 35 DIM. Alpha and beta diversities showed a different uterine
microbiome from CE compared to healthy or SCE, but no differences were found
between healthy and SCE cows. At the phylum level, the relative abundance of
Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria, and at genera level, of Trueperella was greater
in CE than healthy or SCE cows. Trueperella pyogenes was the predominant bacteria
cultured in cows with CE, and a wide variety of bacterial growth was found in
healthy and SCE cows. Bacteria that grew in culture were represented within the
most abundant bacterial genera based on metagenomic sequencing. The uterine
microbiota was similar between SCE and healthy, but the microbiome in cows with
CE had a loss of bacterial diversity.
