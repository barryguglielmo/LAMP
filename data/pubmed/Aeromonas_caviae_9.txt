The present study was developed to characterize, at the species level, 34 strains
of Aeromonas spp., previously isolated from stressed tambaqui fish (Colossoma
macropomum), to elucidate virulence factors, as well as their antibiotic
resistance profile. Amplification of the gyrB gene identified the strains as A.
hydrophila, A. dhakensis, A. caviae, A. veronii and A. jandaei. Bacterial
virulence was evaluated by enzymatic assays for phenotypical production of
hemolysins, proteases and lipases followed by the search for genes codifying the 
enzymes β-hemolysin, serine protease and lipase. Phenotypical production of
virulence factors was diversified and proteolytic activity demonstrated to be a
common expression among the strains. On the other hand, the lip gene encoding
extracellular lipase was the most expressed. Furthermore, A. hydrophila was the
most prevalent species isolated from tambaqui in our work.
