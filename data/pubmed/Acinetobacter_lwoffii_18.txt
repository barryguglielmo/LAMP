Background: High concentrations of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), iron (Fe),
and manganese (Mn) were identified in soil samples from two shipyards where
vessel dismantling activities take place in Tanjungjati Village, Indonesia, and
subjected to bioremediation.
Objectives: The aim of the present study was to determine whether the combination
of surfactant solution, bioaugmentation (a consortium of Bacillus subtilis and
Acinetobacter lwoffii), and biostimulation (nutrient amendment and aeration
intermittent) would reduce TPH, Fe, and Mn levels from soil contaminated from
ship dismantling activities.
Methods: Iron and Mn bioavailability were examined according to the Indonesian
technical guidelines for soil chemical analysis with the help of atomic
absorption spectrophotometry. The n-hexane solvent soil was extracted using the
ultrasonic water bath method for TPH analysis.
Results: The highest removal results achieved were TPH (69.62%), Fe (87.10%), and
Mn (29%) for Soil 1 samples and elimination of TPH (28.80%), Fe (65.10%), and Mn 
(57.38%) for Soil 2 samples using a combination of surfactant solution,
bioaugmentation, and biostimulation (nutrient amendment and without aeration
intermittent). Iron and Mn removal in the controls was higher than in the treated
soils, which showed that Fe and Mn could decrease naturally in both contaminated 
soils.
Conclusions: The present study showed that bioremediation using a combination of 
surfactant solution, a consortium of Bacillus subtilis, and Acinetobacter
lwoffii, as well as a nutrient amendment, has the potential to degrade
hydrocarbons in contaminated soil. Furthermore, Bacillus subtilis and
Acinetobacter lwoffii consortium used for bioaugmentation have the potential to
enhance the degradation of hydrocarbons in soil.
