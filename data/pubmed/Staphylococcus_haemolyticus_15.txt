Cell phones, smartphones, and tablets are extensively used in social and
professional life, so they are frequently exposed to bacteria. The main goal of
the present work was to isolate and characterize Staphylococci strains from
students' cell phone mobiles. Subsequently, 24 Staphylococci strains were tested 
against a wide range of antibiotics, for the distribution of some
virulence-related genes and their ability to form biofilm. Staphylococcus spp.
were cultured from all studied devices on chromogenic medium and identified using
the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI), time-of-flight (TOF)
mass spectrometry (MS) technique (MALDI-TOF-MS). The results obtained showed that
S. aureus was the dominant species (19 strains, 79.1%), followed by S. warneri (3
strains, 12.5%), and S. haemolyticus (2 strains, 8.3%). Isolated strains showed
high percentages of hydrolytic enzymes production, resistance to many tested
antibiotics, and 37.5% expressed the mecA gene. The tested strains were highly
adhesive to polystyrene and glass and expressed implicated icaA (62.5%) and icaD 
(66.6%) genes. All Staphylococcus spp. strains tested were found to possess
proteases and the α-hemolysin gene. Our results highlighted the importance of
mobile phones as a great source of Staphylococcus spp., and these species were
found to be resistant to many antibiotics with multiple antibiotic resistance
(MAR) index ranging from (0.444) to (0.812). Most of the studied strains are able
to form biofilm and expressed many virulence genes. Phylogenetic analysis based
on the phenotypic and genetic characters highlighted the phenotypic and genetic
heterogeneity of the S. aureus population studied. Further analyses are needed to
elucidate the human health risks associated with the identified Staphylococci
strains.
