A 72-year-old man with a history of right reverse shoulder arthroplasty presented
with a 1-month history of erythema, pain and drainage from the right shoulder.
Arthrocentesis was performed and synovial fluid gram stain revealed gram-positive
rods. Clinical diagnosis of prosthetic shoulder joint infection was made.
Orthopaedic surgeons performed irrigation and debridement with resection of the
right shoulder prothesis and implantation of an antimicrobial spacer. Operative
cultures grew Actinomyces neuii The patient was treated with 6 weeks of
ceftriaxone with improvement in both clinical symptoms and laboratory values.
Actinomyces species remain a rare cause of late prosthetic joint infection (PJI) 
due to their slow growing and indolent course. While generalised actinomycosis is
often treated with 6-12 months of antibiotics, the treatment course of
Actinomyces PJI is not well characterised, with some sources suggesting a minimum
of 6 weeks of antimicrobial therapy.
