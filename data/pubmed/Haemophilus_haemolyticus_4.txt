Nasopharyngeal colonization with nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a
prerequisite for developing NTHi-associated infections, including otitis media.
Therapies that block NTHi colonization may prevent disease development. We
previously demonstrated that Haemophilus haemolyticus, a closely related human
commensal, can inhibit NTHi colonization and infection of human respiratory
epithelium in vitro We have now assessed whether Muribacter muris (a rodent
commensal from the same family) can prevent NTHi colonization and disease in vivo
using a murine NTHi otitis media model. Otitis media was modeled in BALB/c mice
using coinfection with 1 × 104.5 PFU of influenza A virus MEM H3N2, followed by
intranasal challenge with 5 × 107 CFU of NTHi R2866 Specr Mice were pretreated or
not with an intranasal inoculation of 5 × 107 CFU M. muris 24 h before
coinfection. NTHi and M. muris viable counts and inflammatory mediators (gamma
interferon [IFN-γ], interleukin-1β [IL-1β], IL-6, keratinocyte chemoattractant
[KC], and IL-10) were measured in nasal washes and middle ear tissue homogenate. 
M. muris pretreatment decreased the median colonization density of NTHi from
6 × 105 CFU/ml to 9 × 103 CFU/ml (P = 0.0004). Only 1/12 M. muris-pretreated mice
developed otitis media on day 5 compared to 8/15 mice with no pretreatment (8%
versus 53%, P = 0.0192). Inflammation, clinical score, and weight loss were also 
lower in M. muris-pretreated mice. We have demonstrated that a single dose of a
closely related commensal can delay onset of NTHi otitis media in vivo Human
challenge studies investigating prevention of NTHi colonization are warranted to 
reduce the global burden of otitis media and other NTHi diseases.
