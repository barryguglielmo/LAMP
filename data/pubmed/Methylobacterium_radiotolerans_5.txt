This study reports on the isolation and identification of Methylobacterium
radiotolerans MAMP 4754 from the seeds of the medicinal plant, Combretum
erythrophyllum, for the purposes of investigating antimicrobial and antioxidant
activities from this endophyte. The strain identity was confirmed by 16S
rRNA-based phylogeny and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Ethyl acetate and
chloroform (1 : 1 v/v) extracts from the endophyte were tested for antimicrobial 
and antioxidant activity on a total of 7 bacterial species (3 Gram-positive and 4
Gram-negative) using the standard Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) protocol
and Quantitative Radical Scavenging activity using the 2,
2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, respectively. The MICs were recorded at
250 μg/mL for B. subtilis ATCC 19659, B. cereus ATCC 1076, E. coli ATCC1053, and 
62.5 μg/mL for K. oxytoca ATCC 13182 and M. smegmatis ATCC 21293, while an IC50
of 5.65 μg/mL was recorded with the DPPH assay. Qualitative phytochemical
analysis was positive for alkaloids, flavonoids, and steroids. Gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis revealed the presence of
9-octadecene, 2,4-dinitrophenyl acetate, and 2(5H)-furanone, which have been
previously reported for the targeted activities. M. radiotolerans MAMP 4754
tested positive for antimicrobial and antioxidant activity and this is linked to 
the production of plant-derived secondary metabolites by this strain.
