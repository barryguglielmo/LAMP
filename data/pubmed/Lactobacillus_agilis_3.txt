Gastrointestinal microbiota play an important role in regulating the metabolic
processes of animals and humans. A properly balanced cecal microbiota modulates
growth parameters and the risk of infections. The study examined the effect of
the addition of 0.2% and 0.3% of Tenebrio molitor and Zophobas morio on cecal
microbiome of broilers. The material was the cecum digesta. The obtained DNA was 
analyzed using 16S rRNA next generation sequencing. The results of the study show
that the addition of a relatively small amount of Z. morio and T. molitor
modulates the broiler cecum microbiome composition. The most positive effect on
cecal microbiota was recorded in the 0.2% Z. morio diet. A significant increase
in the relative amount of genus Lactobacillus, represented by the species
Lactobacillus agilis and the amount of bacteria in the Clostridia class, was
observed. Moreover, the addition of 0.2% ZM resulted in a significant increase of
relative abundance of the family Bifidobacteriaceae with the highest relative
abundance of genus Bifidobacterium pseudolongum. The obtained results indicate
that the addition of a relatively small amount of insect meal in broiler diet
stimulates colonization by probiotic and commensal bacteria, which may act as
barriers against infection by pathogenic bacteria.
