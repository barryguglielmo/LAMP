Pathogenic Bordetella bacteria release a neurotropic dermonecrotic toxin (DNT)
that is endocytosed into animal cells and permanently activates the Rho family
GTPases by polyamination or deamidation of the glutamine residues in their switch
II regions (e.g., Gln63 of RhoA). DNT was found to enable high level colonization
of the nasal cavity of pigs by B. bronchiseptica and the capacity of DNT to
inhibit differentiation of nasal turbinate bone osteoblasts causes atrophic
rhinitis in infected pigs. However, it remains unknown whether DNT plays any role
also in virulence of the human pathogen B. pertussis and in pathogenesis of the
whooping cough disease. We report a procedure for purification of large amounts
of LPS-free recombinant DNT that exhibits a high biological activity on cells
expressing the DNT receptors Cav3.1 and Cav3.2. Electron microscopy and single
particle image analysis of negatively stained preparations revealed that the DNT 
molecule adopts a V-shaped structure with well-resolved protein domains. These
results open the way to structure-function studies on DNT and its interactions
with airway epithelial layers.
