In mycobacteria, transcriptional activator PafBC is responsible for upregulating 
the majority of genes induced by DNA damage. Understanding the mechanism of PafBC
activation is impeded by a lack of structural information on this transcription
factor that contains a widespread, but poorly understood WYL domain frequently
encountered in bacterial transcription factors. Here, we determine the crystal
structure of Arthrobacter aurescens PafBC. The protein consists of two modules,
each harboring an N-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain followed by a
central WYL and a C-terminal extension (WCX) domain. The WYL domains exhibit
Sm-folds, while the WCX domains adopt ferredoxin-like folds, both characteristic 
for RNA-binding proteins. Our results suggest a mechanism of regulation in which 
WYL domain-containing transcription factors may be activated by binding RNA or
other nucleic acid molecules. Using an in vivo mutational screen in Mycobacterium
smegmatis, we identify potential co-activator binding sites on PafBC.
