OBJECTIVE: To determine whether exposure to UV germicidal irradiation (UVGI)
reduces concentrations of viable aerosolized microorganisms (attenuated strains
of common veterinary pathogens) in a simulated heating, ventilation, and air
conditioning (HVAC) system.
SAMPLE: 42 air samples seeded with bacteriophage MS2 or attenuated strains of
Bordetella bronchiseptica, feline calicivirus, feline herpesvirus-1, canine
parvovirus, or canine distemper virus (6/microorganism) or with no microorganisms
added (6).
PROCEDURES: A simulated HVAC unit was built that included a nebulizer to
aerosolize microorganisms suspended in phosphate-buffered water, a fan to produce
airflow, 2 UVGI bulb systems, and an impinger for air sampling. Ten-minute trials
(3 with UVGI, 3 without UVGI, and 1 negative control) were conducted for each
microorganism. Impingers collected microorganisms into phosphate-buffered water
for subsequent quantification with culture-based assays. Results for samples
yielding no target microorganisms were recorded as the assay's lower limit of
detection. Statistical analysis was not performed.
RESULTS: The UVGI treatment resulted in subjectively lower concentrations of
viable MS2, B bronchiseptica, and canine distemper virus (arithmetic mean ± SD
log10 microorganism reduction, 2.57 ± 0.47, ≥ 3.45 ± 0.24, and ≥ 1.50 ± 0.25,
respectively) collected from air. Feline herpesvirus-1 was detected in only 1
sample without and no samples with UVGI treatment. Feline calicivirus and canine 
parvovirus were not detectable in any collected samples.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results for some surrogates of veterinary
pathogens suggested a potential benefit to supplementing manual disinfection
practices with UVGI-based air cleaning systems in animal care environments.
Further research is needed to investigate the utility of UVGI in operating HVAC
systems.
