Background and Objectives: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a multidrug resistant 
opportunistic pathogen, which is normally present in hospital settings and has
very high mortality rates.
Materials and Methods: A prospective study was conducted over a period of two
years. The specimens were processed by Gram staining and aerobic culture. The
bacteria were isolated using standard protocols. The extent of antibiotic
resistance of commonly used antimicrobials and biofilm production were studied in
the isolates.
Results: A total of 80 strains of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were isolated. The
maximum sensitivity (93.8%) of these isolates was noticed for cotrimoxazole.
63.7% of strains were strong biofilm producers. The group given pathogen specific
antibiotic showed better prognosis (P value ≤ 0.05).
Conclusion: Early diagnosis and proper management of cases infected with
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is important to avoid therapeutic failures.
