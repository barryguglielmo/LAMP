A moderate thermophilic dibenzofuran (DF) degrader, strain 4B1, was isolated from
dioxin-contaminated soil in Vietnam under thermophilic condition. A 16S rRNA gene
sequence analysis assigned the strain to genus Paenibacillus. The optimum growth 
temperature of strain 4B1 was 45°C with a doubling time of 2.7 h in the presence 
of DF as a sole carbon and energy source. The rate of its growth and
DF-degradation were approximately 3-fold higher than those of a reference
Paenibacillus sp. strain. The 4B1 strain degraded 89% of 1000 mg L-1 DF within
48 h cultivation at the optimum temperature. TBLASTN analysis based on its draft 
genome sequence revealed that this strain possessed a dbf gene cluster. The open 
reading frames (dbfA1A2RBC) in the cluster shared 99-100% identity with those of 
Paenibacillus sp. YK5, indicating that DF was likely degraded by an angular
dioxygenation pathway in strain 4B1. Four genes in the dbf gene cluster
(dbfA1A2BC) were partially induced by DF, which was observed by semi-quantitative
RT-PCR. Quantitative PCR analysis of dbfA1 transcripts, encoding the alpha
subunit of DF dioxygenase, indicated that dbfA1 was expressed 4-times higher than
that of strain YK5 at 45°C. These results suggest that the faster growth and
degradation of DF in strain 4B1 could be due to differences in transcriptional
regulation of dbf cluster genes.
