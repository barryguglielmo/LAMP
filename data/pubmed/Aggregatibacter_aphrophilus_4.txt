Dermacoccus spp. have rarely been reported as human pathogens. We describe a case
of a 4-year-old boy with congenital heart disease who was diagnosed with a brain 
abscess. The abscess was drained and the sample grew Streptococcus intermedius,
Aggregatibacter aphrophilus and Dermacoccus sp.. Dermacoccus grew after 5 days of
incubation and the patient was treated with meropenem.
