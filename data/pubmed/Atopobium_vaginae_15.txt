In recent studies, the interleukin (IL)-36 cytokines were shown to be elevated in
women with non-Lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microbiomes. In this study, we
evaluated IL36G expression in clinical samples from women with and without
bacterial vaginosis (BV) and a human 3-dimensional cervical epithelial cell
model. IL36G expression was significantly elevated in cervicovaginal epithelial
cells isolated from BV-positive women and corresponded with increased neutrophil 
counts relative to BV-negative women. In addition, specific BV-associated
bacterial species as well as a polymicrobial cocktail significantly induced IL36G
expression in vitro. These findings suggest that IL-36γ may exhibit an important 
function in the host response to BV and other sexually transmitted infections.
