This work aimed to determine the frequency and diversity of Staphylococcus
species carriage in horses intended for human consumption, as well as their
resistance and virulence determinants. Eighty samples (30 nasal; 50 faecal) were 
recovered from 73 healthy horses in a Spanish slaughterhouse. The samples were
cultured for staphylococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRS)
recovery. The phenotype/genotype of antimicrobial resistance was analysed for all
isolates. The spa-type and sequence-type (ST) were determined in Staphylococcus
aureus strains; moreover, the presence of virulence and host-adaptation genes
(tst, eta, etb, pvl, lukPQ, scn-eq, and scn) was studied by PCR. Staphylococcus
species were detected in 27/30 (90%) and 33/50 (66%) of nasal and faecal samples,
respectively. Ninety isolates belonging to eight species were recovered, with
predominance of S. aureus (n = 34), Staphylococcus delphini (n = 19), and
Staphylococcus sciuri (n = 19). S. aureus strains were all
methicillin-susceptible (MSSA), 28/34 were susceptible to all the antibiotics
tested, and the remaining six showed resistance to (gene-detected) streptomycin
(ant (6)-Ia), penicillin (blaZ), and trimetroprim/sulphametoxazole (SXT) (dfrA,
dfrG). The lineage ST1640/t2559 was predominant (n = 21). The genes lukPQ and
scn-eq were present in all but the ST1640 isolates. Three S. sciuri isolates were
multidrug-resistant. Healthy horses in Spain seem to be a reservoir for virulent 
MSSA and the lineage ST1640, although the presence of the latter in horses is
described for the first time in this study. Moreover, the equine-adapted
leukocidin gene lukPQ is frequent among S. aureus strains. A large variety of
staphylococcal species with low antibiotic resistance rate were also observed.
