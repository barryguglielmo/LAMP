We report a case of a 15-year-old female presenting with a serious multisystemic 
inflammatory illness during a surge of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) cases in our county.
The initial clinical findings of sore throat and neck stiffness, followed by
signs of sepsis, raised suspicion of Lemierre syndrome early in her hospital
course. However, the presence of severe respiratory distress, multifocal
pneumonia with pleural effusion on chest radiograph, acute kidney injury, and the
discovery of coronary artery ectasia, pointed to the new entity "multisystem
inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)." Immune modulatory treatment was thus 
considered. However, progressive neck pain and swelling, coupled with the
eventual growth of Fusobacterium necrophorum on blood culture, eventually led to 
the correct diagnosis of Lemierre syndrome.
