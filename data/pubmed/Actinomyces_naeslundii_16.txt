Purpose: Dental caries is a multi-factorial oral disease, requiring a susceptible
host, cariogenic microorganisms and suitable substrate. Caries is extended
worldwide in spite of the availability of countless prophylactic means, including
fluoride toothpaste and dental sealers. Many efforts have been made to achieve
isolation of pure natural products for medicinal use. Flavonoids are bioactive
polyphenol compounds possessing multidimensional effects such as antibacterial
action.
Methods: The present study targeted the characterization of antibacterial and
antifungal activity of various flavonoids (apigenin, catechin, luteolin, morin,
myricetin, naringin, quercetin and rutin). Nine strains present in dental plaque 
were used: Agreggatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Actinomyces naeslundii,
Actinomyces viscosus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus
casei, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus sanguinis as
well as Candida albicans fungal strain.
Results: Results revealed that luteolin, morin, naringin, quercetin and rutin
effectively inhibited bacterial and fungal growth. However, morin was the most
effective flavonoid.
Conclusion: It might then be concluded that flavonoids show bacteriostatic effect
on all of tested bacteria and fungus.
