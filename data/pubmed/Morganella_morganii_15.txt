Toxin complex (Tc) toxins are virulence factors of pathogenic bacteria. Tcs are
composed of three subunits: TcA, TcB and TcC. TcA facilitates receptor-toxin
interaction and membrane permeation, TcB and TcC form a toxin-encapsulating
cocoon. While the mechanisms of holotoxin assembly and pore formation have been
described, little is known about receptor binding of TcAs. Here, we identify
heparins/heparan sulfates and Lewis antigens as receptors for different TcAs from
insect and human pathogens. Glycan array screening reveals that all tested TcAs
bind negatively charged heparins. Cryo-EM structures of Morganella morganii TcdA4
and Xenorhabdus nematophila XptA1 reveal that heparins/heparan sulfates
unexpectedly bind to different regions of the shell domain, including
receptor-binding domains. In addition, Photorhabdus luminescens TcdA1 binds to
Lewis antigens with micromolar affinity. Here, the glycan interacts with the
receptor-binding domain D of the toxin. Our results suggest a glycan dependent
association mechanism of Tc toxins on the host cell surface.
