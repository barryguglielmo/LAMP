Fermentation of carbohydrates present in lignocellulosic (LC) biomass is
facilitated by lignin removal, which is usually achieved by adopting various
pretreatment methods to provide the enzymes proper access to their respective
substrates. Pretreatment using ionic liquid (IL) is relatively recent advancement
and considered as mild and green process. ILs can dissolve extensive quantities
of biomass and depolymerize the cellulose. In this context, an abundantly
available LC biomass, sugarcane bagasse (SB), was pretreated using alkali or with
an IL, methyltrioctylammonium chloride, and was used for cellulase production
from thermophilic bacteria. In all, 26 indigenously isolated thermophilic
bacterial strains were quantitatively screened for cellulase production. 16S rDNA
sequences of the promising isolates UE10 and UE27 revealed relatedness with
Brevibacillus borstelensis, while the strain UE1 belonged to Aneurinibacillus
thermoaerophilus. Cellulase production was compared by utilizing alkali
pretreated and IL pretreated SB and the later was found more appropriate. UE1,
UE10 and UE27 yielded 22.2, 22.18 and 33.3 IU mL-1 of endoglucanase,
respectively, by fermenting IL pretreated SB. The changes in SB structure after
pretreatment were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. This study
demonstrated the potential of novel thermophilic bacterial strains to utilize IL 
pretreated SB for production of industrially important enzyme, cellulase.
