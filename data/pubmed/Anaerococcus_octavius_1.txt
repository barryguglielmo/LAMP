Anaerococcus spp. are Gram-positive anaerobic cocci involved in human skin and
soft-tissue infections, among other diseases. We report the first known case of
bacteremia due to A. octavius, detected in an elderly patient. A 71-year-old
woman with a history of breast cancer presented with fever and cognitive
impairment for more than three days. A. octavius was isolated in blood cultures, 
and only resistance to clindamycin was reported. Her general condition improved
after treatment with metronidazole and she was discharged.
