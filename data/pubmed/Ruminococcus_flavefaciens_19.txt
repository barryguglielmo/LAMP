The cellulosomal enzyme, RfGH51/2, of Ruminococcus flavefaciens contains an
N-terminal module, a family 5 glycoside hydrolase GH5_4 with a putative
endoglucanase activity, while C-terminal domain is a putative endo-mannanase
(GH5_7). The two putative catalytic modules are separated by family 80
carbohydrate binding module (CBM80) having wide ligand specificity. The putative 
endo-mannanase module, GH5_7 (RfGH5_7), was cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli
BL-21(DE3) cells and purified. SDS-PAGE analysis of purified RfGH5_7 showed
molecular size ~ 35 kDa. Substrate specificity analysis of RfGH5_7 showed maximum
activity against locust bean galactomannan (298.5 U/mg) followed by konjac
glucomannan (256.2 U/mg) and carob galactomannan (177.2 U/mg). RfGH5_7 showed
maximum activity at optimum pH 6.0 and temperature 60 °C. RfGH5_7 displayed
stability in between pH 6.0 and 9.0 and thermostability till 50 °C. 10 mM Ca2+
ions increased the enzyme activity by 33%. The melting temperature of RfGH5_7 was
84 °C that was not affected by Ca2+ ions or chelating agents. RfGH5_7 showed,
Vmax, 389 U/mg and Km, 0.92 mg/mL for locust bean galactomannan. TLC analysis
revealed that RfGH5_7 hydrolysed locust bean galactomannan predominantly to
mannose, mannobiose, mannotriose and higher degree of polymerization of
manno-oligosaccharides indicating an endo-acting catalytic mechanism. This study 
revealed a highly active and thermostable endo-mannanase with considerable
biotechnological potential.
