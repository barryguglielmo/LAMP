INTRODUCTION: The direct association between some microbial species and cancers, 
such as in colorectal cancer (CRC), has been disclosed.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in intestinal
microbiota in subjects with CRC compared with healthy group.
METHODS: Three-hundred fecal specimens were gathered from patients with CRC and
300 from healthy individuals during March 2014 to October 2019 from two hospitals
in Tehran. The informed consent form and the questionnaire were completed by the 
patients. Following the identification of Lactobaccilus acidophilus (L.
acidophilus), Lactobacillus palntarom (L. palntarom), and Enterococcus faecalis
(E. faecalis), the number of bacteria was determined using quantitative real-time
PCR (qPCR).
RESULTS: The patients' age range was 20-76 years (mean: 55.34 Â± 3.66). The qPCR
clarified that number of E. faecalis was 2.2-fold higher in patients with CRC
compared to healthy population (p = 0.0013). Additionally, the number of L.
acidophilus and L. plantarom was 3.4-fold (p < 0.0001) and 4.8-fold (p < 0.0001) 
higher in healthy population.
CONCLUSION: The inhibitory effect of intestinal microflora against the CRC
development was proposed by observation of the changes in intestinal microbiota
and determining their composition in subjects with CRC compared with that of
healthy individuals. Microbiota was considered as a goal for the prevention and
treatment of CRC. The relationship between microbiota and human health would be
known deeper; this knowledge provides insights into the management of intestinal 
microbiota and therapeutics.
