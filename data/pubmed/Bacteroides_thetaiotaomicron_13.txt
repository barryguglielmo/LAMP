Our emerging view of the gut microbiome largely focuses on bacteria, while less
is known about other microbial components, such as bacteriophages (phages).
Though phages are abundant in the gut, very few phages have been isolated from
this ecosystem. Here, we report the genomes of 27 phages from the United States
and Bangladesh that infect the prevalent human gut bacterium Bacteroides
thetaiotaomicron. These phages are mostly distinct from previously sequenced
phages with the exception of two, which are crAss-like phages. We compare these
isolates to existing human gut metagenomes, revealing similarities to previously 
inferred phages and additional unexplored phage diversity. Finally, we use host
tropisms of these phages to identify alleles of phage structural genes associated
with infectivity. This work provides a detailed view of the gut's "viral dark
matter" and a framework for future efforts to further integrate isolation- and
sequencing-focused efforts to understand gut-resident phages.
