Infective endocarditis (IE) is classified as an infection of any cardiac valve or
endocardial surface and is often associated with high morbidity and mortality.
Certain bacteria such as gram-positive cocci and viridans group streptococci have
high predilection for both naïve and damaged cardiac valvular tissues, accounting
for the majority of IE cases. In very infrequent instances, gram-negative
bacteria (GNB), more specifically non-meningococcal, non-gonococcal GNB, have
been shown to cause IE. The following is a case of a young male diagnosed with
Neisseria flavescens/subflava tricuspid valve endocarditis after being previously
treated for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) endocarditis.
