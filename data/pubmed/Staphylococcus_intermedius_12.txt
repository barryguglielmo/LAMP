The Staphylococcus intermedius group (SIG) is a collection of coagulase-positive 
staphylococci consisting of four distinct species, namely, Staphylococcus
cornubiensis, Staphylococcus delphini, Staphylococcus intermedius, and
Staphylococcus pseudintermedius SIG members are animal pathogens and rare causes 
of human infection. Accurate identification of S. pseudintermedius has important 
implications for interpretation of antimicrobial susceptibility testing data and 
may be important for other members of the group. Therefore, we sought to evaluate
the performance of five commercially available identification platforms with 21
S. delphini isolates obtained from a variety of animal and geographic sources.
Here, we show that automated biochemical platforms were unable to identify S.
delphini to the species level, a function of its omission from their databases,
but could identify isolates to the SIG level with various degrees of success.
However, all automated systems misidentified at least one isolate as
Staphylococcus aureus One matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of
flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) system was able to identify S. delphini
to the species level, suggesting that MALDI-TOF MS is the best option for
distinguishing members of the SIG. With the exception of S. pseudintermedius, it 
is unclear if other SIG members should be routinely identified to the species
level; however, as our understanding of their role in animal and human diseases
increases, it may be necessary and important to do so.
