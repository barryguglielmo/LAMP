Streptococcus constellatus is a member of Streptococcus milleri group which is a 
subgroup of Viridans streptococci, first described by Guthof in 1956 after being 
isolated from dental abscesses. S. constellatus, a gram positive, non-sporing,
non-motile, catalase negative cocci, is the normal flora of the oropharyngeal,
gastrointestinal and urogenital tract. It is not a commonly encountered pathogen 
but has a propensity to form abscesses and cause bacteremia in the
immunocompromised patient. Here, we report a 78-year-old man with sepsis due to
Streptococcus constellatus liver abscess. The patient had a history of
hypertension, stroke, benign prostatic hyperplasia, vascular dementia and
myocardial infarction status post coronary artery bypass grafting. There has been
no particular link between any of these conditions to S. constellatus. However,
immunocompromised status predisposes to fulminant infection and formation of
abscesses. The patient was febrile with a temperature of 99.1°F, blood pressure
of 143/73 mmHg and the heart rate (HR) of 98. Labs revealed a leukocytosis of
16.90 K/uL, hemoglobin 11.8 g/dL, hematocrit 35.8%, total bilirubin 1.7 mg/dL,
direct bilirubin 1.0 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 44 IU/L, alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) 28 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALKP) 176 IU/L and lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) was 290 IU/L. He was started on intravenous Maxipime and
Unasyn which was switched to Rocephin and Clindamycin based on the Infectious
disease recommendations. Metronidazole was also started and the serologies were
sent for Entamoeba histolytica. Computerized tomography (CT) scan showed an
abscess in the right lobe of the liver which was finally drained using an
interventional radiology (IR)-guided approach. The cultures from the fluid and
blood yielded S. constellatus and thus Metronidazole was discontinued. The
patient improved after a few days and the drainage catheter was pulled out and
the patient discharged in stable condition.
