OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the antibacterial
effect of a novel non-resorbable, bioactive polymeric nanostructured membrane
(NMs), when doped with zinc, calcium and doxycycline.
METHODS: A validated in vitro subgingival biofilm model with six bacterial
species (Streptococcus oralis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonela parvula,
Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter
actinomycetemcomitans) was used. The experimental NMs, with and without being
doped with doxycycline, calcium and zinc, were placed on hydroxyapatite (HA)
discs. As positive control membranes, commercially available dense
polytetrafluoroethylene (d-PTFE) membranes were used and, as negative controls,
the HA discs without any membrane. The experimental, positive and negative
control discs were exposed to a mixed bacterial suspension, at 37 °C under
anaerobic conditions, during 12, 24, 48 and 72 h. The resulting biofilms were
analyzed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), to study their structure,
and by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), to assess the bacterial
load, expressed as colony forming units (CFU) per mL. Differences between
experimental and control groups were evaluated with the general linear model and 
the Bonferroni adjustment.
RESULTS: As shown by SEM, all membrane groups, except the NMs with doxycycline,
resulted in structured biofilms from 12-72 hours. Similarly, only the membranes
loaded with doxycycline demonstrated a significant reduction in bacterial load
during biofilm development, when compared with the control groups (p < 0.001).
SIGNIFICANCE: Doxycycline-doped nanostructured membranes have an impact on
biofilm growth dynamics by significant reducing the bacterial load.
