acquisition.

Despite an overall temporal stability in time of the human gut microbiota at the 
phylum level, strong variations in species abundance have been observed. We are
far from a clear understanding of what promotes or disrupts the stability of
microbiome communities. Environmental factors, like food or antibiotic use,
modify the gut microbiota composition, but their overall impacts remain
relatively low. Phages, the viruses that infect bacteria, might constitute
important factors explaining temporal variations in species abundance. Gut
bacteria harbour numerous prophages, or dormant viruses, which can evolve to
become ultravirulent phage mutants, potentially leading to important bacterial
death. Whether such phenomenon occurs in the mammal's microbiota has been largely
unexplored. Here we studied temperate phage-bacteria coevolution in gnotoxenic
mice colonised with Roseburia intestinalis, a dominant symbiont of the human gut 
microbiota, and Escherichia coli, a sub-dominant member of the same microbiota.
We show that R. intestinalis L1-82 harbours two active prophages, Jekyll and
Shimadzu. We observed the systematic evolution in mice of ultravirulent Shimadzu 
phage mutants, which led to a collapse of R. intestinalis population. In a second
step, phage infection drove the fast counter-evolution of host phage resistance
mainly through phage-derived spacer acquisition in a clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeats array. Alternatively, phage resistance was 
conferred by a prophage originating from an ultravirulent phage with a restored
ability to lysogenize. Our results demonstrate that prophages are a potential
source of ultravirulent phages that can successfully infect most of the
susceptible bacteria. This suggests that prophages can play important roles in
the short-term temporal variations observed in the composition of the gut
microbiota.
