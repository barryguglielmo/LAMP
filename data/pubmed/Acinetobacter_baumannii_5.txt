Here, we report the complete genome sequences of four clinical isolates of
extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (XDRAB), isolated in Thailand.
These results revealed multiple antimicrobial-resistant genes, each involving two
sequence type 16 (ST16) isolates, ST2, and a novel sequence type isolate, ST1479.
