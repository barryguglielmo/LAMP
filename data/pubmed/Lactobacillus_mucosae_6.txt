OBJECTIVE: In this study, we characterised a novel lysophospholipase (LysoPL)
from the L. mucosae LM1 strain. The gene, LM-lysoPL, encoding LysoPL from L.
mucosae LM1 was cloned, analyzed, and expressed.
RESULTS: LM-lysoPL contained a conserved region and catalytic triad motif
responsible for lysophospholipase activity. After purification, UHPLC-MS analysis
showed that recombinant LM-LysoPL hydrolyzed phosphatidic acid, generating
lysophosphatidic acid. The enzyme had greater hydrolytic activity against C16 and
C18 fatty acids, indicating a preference for long-chain fatty acids. Enzymatic
assays showed that the optimal pH and temperature of recombinant LM-LysoPL were 7
and 30 Â°C, respectively, and it was enzymatically active within a narrow pH
range.
CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify
and characterize a lysophospholipase from lactic acid bacteria. Our findings
provide a basis for understanding the probiotic role of L. mucosae LM1 in the
gut.
