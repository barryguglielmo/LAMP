Surface protection against biofilms is still an open challenge. Current
strategies rely on coatings that are meant to guarantee antiadhesive or
antimicrobial effects. While it seems difficult to ensure antiadhesion in complex
media and against all the adhesive arsenal of microbes, strategies based on
antimicrobials lack from sustainable functionalization methodologies to allow the
perfect efficiency of the grafted molecules. Here we used the high affinity
ligand-receptor interaction between biotin and streptavidin to functionalize
surfaces with lysozyme, an enzyme that degrades the bacterial peptidoglycan cell 
wall. Biotinylated lysozyme was grafted on surfaces coated with streptavidin
receptors. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based single molecule force
spectroscopy, we showed that grafting through ligand-receptor interaction allows 
the correct orientation of the enzyme on the substrate for enhanced activity
towards the microbial target. The antibacterial efficiency was tested against
Micrococcus luteus and revealed that surface protection was improved when
lysozyme was grafted through the ligand-receptor interaction. These results
suggest that bio-molecular interactions are promising for a sustainable grafting 
of antimicrobial agents on surfaces.
