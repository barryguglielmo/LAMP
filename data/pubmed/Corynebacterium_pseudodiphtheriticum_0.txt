We investigated whether the ability of commensal respiratory bacteria to modulate
the innate immune response against bacterial and viral pathogens was a shared or 
strain-specific characteristic. Bacterial strains belonging to the
Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum and Dolosigranulum pigrum species were
compared by studying their influence in the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2- and
TLR3-triggered immune responses in the respiratory tract, as well as in the
resistance to Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and Streptococcus pneumoniae
infections. We demonstrated that nasally administered C. pseudodiphteriticum
090104 or D. pigrum 040417 were able to modulate respiratory immunity and
increase the resistance against pathogens, while other strains of the same
species did not influence the respiratory immune responses, demonstrating a clear
strain-dependent immunomodulatory effect of respiratory commensal bacteria. We
also reported here that bacterium-like particles (BLP) and cell walls derived
from immunomodulatory respiratory commensal bacteria are an interesting
alternative for the modulation of the respiratory immune system. Our study is a
step forward in the positioning of certain strains of respiratory commensal
bacteria as next-generation probiotics for the respiratory tract.
