OBJECTIVES: Evaluate a new modified quaternary ammonium silane irrigant solution 
for its antimicrobial, cytotoxic and mechanical properties of dentine substrate.
METHODS: Root canal preparation was performed using stainless steel K-files™ and 
F4 size protaper with irrigation protocols of 6% NaOCl + 2% CHX; 3.5% QIS; 2% QIS
and sterile saline. Biofilms were prepared using E. faecalis adjusted and allowed
to grow for 3 days, treated with irrigants, and allowed to grow for 7 days. AFM
was performed and surface free energy calculated. MC3T3 cells were infected with 
endo irrigant treated E. faecalis biofilms. Raman spectroscopy of biofilms were
performed after bacterial re-growth on root dentine and exposed to different
irrigation protocols and collagen fibers analysed collagen fibers using TEM.
Antimicrobial potency against E. faecalis biofilms and cytoxicity against 3T3 NIH
cells were also. Resin penetration and MitoTracker green were also evaluated for 
sealer penetration and mitochondrial viability. Data were analysed using One-way 
ANOVA, principal component analysis and post-hoc Fisher's least-significant
difference.
RESULTS: Elastic moduli were maintained amongst control (5.5 ± 0.9) and 3.5% QIS 
(4.4 ± 1.1) specimens with surface free energy higher in QIS specimens. MC3T3
cells showed reduced viability in 6%NaOCl+2%CHX specimens compared to QIS
specimens. DNA/purine were expressed in increased intensities in control and 6%
NaOCl + 2% CHX specimens with bands around 480-490 cm-1 reduced in QIS specimens.
3.5% QIS specimens showed intact collagen fibrillar network and predominantly
dead bacterial cells in confocal microscopy. 3.5% QIS irrigant formed a thin
crust-type surface layer with cytoplasmic extensions of 3T3NIH spread over root
dentine. Experiments confirmed MitoTracker accumulation in 3.5% treated cells.
SIGNIFICANCE: Novel QIS root canal irrigant achieved optimum antimicrobial
protection inside the root canals facilitating a toxic effect against the
Enterococcus faecalis biofilm. Root dentine substrates exhibited optimum
mechanical properties and there was viability of fibroblastic mitochondria.
