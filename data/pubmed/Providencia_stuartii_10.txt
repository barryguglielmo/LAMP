In the present study, a hybrid treatment system (biological and ozonation) was
developed and used in the decolorization of Congo red (CR) dye. The biological
treatment was performed in packed bed bioreactor (PBBR) containing Arjuna
(Terminalia Arjuna) seeds biochar immobilized with Providencia stuartii, whereas 
ozonation was carried out in an ozone reactor. The process variables such as
temperature, process time, and inoculum size were optimized and found to be
30 °C, 2 48 h, and 3 × 105 CFU/mL, respectively with 92.0 ± 5.0% of dye
decolorization. Furthermore, biologically treated effluent was subject to ozone
treatment for the decolorization of the remaining CR dye. The hybrid approach
reveals almost complete decolorization of Congo red (CR) dye. The kinetic study
of microbial growth was examined by Monod model. In addition, the cost analysis
estimation for the removal of CR dye was done, and removal per liter was found to
be economic.
