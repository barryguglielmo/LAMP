Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is a promising bacterial chassis for the conversion of 
lignin-derived aromatic compound mixtures to biofuels and bioproducts. Despite
the inherent robustness of this strain, further improvements to aromatic
catabolism and toxicity tolerance of P. putida will be required to achieve
industrial relevance. Here, tolerance adaptive laboratory evolution (TALE) was
employed with increasing concentrations of the hydroxycinnamic acids p-coumaric
acid (pCA) and ferulic acid (FA) individually and in combination (pCA ​+ ​FA).
The TALE experiments led to evolved P. putida strains with increased tolerance to
the targeted acids as compared to wild type. Specifically, a 37 ​h decrease in
lag phase in 20 ​g/L pCA and a 2.4-fold increase in growth rate in 30 ​g/L FA was
observed. Whole genome sequencing of intermediate and endpoint evolved P. putida 
populations revealed several expected and non-intuitive genetic targets
underlying these aromatic catabolic and toxicity tolerance enhancements. PP_3350 
and ttgB were among the most frequently mutated genes, and the beneficial
contributions of these mutations were verified via gene knockouts. Deletion of
PP_3350, encoding a hypothetical protein, recapitulated improved toxicity
tolerance to high concentrations of pCA, but not an improved growth rate in high 
concentrations of FA. Deletion of ttgB, part of the TtgABC efflux pump, severely 
inhibited growth in pCA ​+ ​FA TALE-derived strains but did not affect growth in 
pCA ​+ ​FA in a wild type background, suggesting epistatic interactions. Genes
involved in flagellar movement and transcriptional regulation were often mutated 
in the TALE experiments on multiple substrates, reinforcing ideas of a minimal
and deregulated cell as optimal for domesticated growth. Overall, this work
demonstrates increased tolerance towards and growth rate at the expense of
hydroxycinnamic acids and presents new targets for improving P. putida for
microbial lignin valorization.
