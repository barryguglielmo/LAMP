Aeromonas veronii is a major pathogenic bacterium in humans and animals. When it 
causes outbreaks, there are enormous economic losses to the aquaculture industry.
An effective live attenuated vaccine strain, ΔhisJ, was obtained in our previous 
studies by gene knockout in Aeromonas veronii TH0426 using the suicide vector
pRE112. Here, we evaluated whether the live attenuated vaccine ΔhisJ was suitable
for prevention of Aeromonas veronii infection by injection and immersion in
loaches. Compared with that of the TH0426 wild-type strain, the virulence of the 
live vaccine was significantly weakened. Vaccine safety assessment results also
indicated that 1 × 107 CFU/mL live vaccine was safe and did not induce clinical
symptoms or obvious pathological changes. Additionally, after challenging loaches
with Aeromonas veronii TH0426, the relative percent survival of the IN3 injection
group was 65.66%, and that of the IM group was 50.78%. Our data show that the
live attenuated vaccine ΔhisJ can improve the immune protection rate of loaches. 
Furthermore, increased enzyme activity parameters (SOD, LZM, ACP, and AKP) in the
skin mucus, increased enzyme activity parameters (SOD, LZM, ACP, AKP, and GPx) in
the serum, increased specific IgM antibodies and cytokine IL-1β contents in the
serum, and increased cytokine (IL-15, pIgR, IL-1β, and TNF-α) expression in the
liver and spleen were observed. These data are the first to indicate that the
live attenuated vaccine ΔhisJ is suitable for the development of a safe and
effective vaccine against Aeromonas veronii infection in loach aquaculture.
