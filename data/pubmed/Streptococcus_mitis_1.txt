Antibiotic resistance is increasing even in ocular pathogens, therefore the
interest towards antiseptics in Ophthalmology is growing. The aim of this study
was to analyze the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy and the in vitro effects of an
ophthalmic formulation containing hexamidine diisethionate 0.05%,
polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) 0.0001% disodium edetate (EDTA) 0.01%,
dexpanthenol 5% and polyvinyl alcohol 1.25% (Keratosept, Bruschettini, Genova,
Italy) on cultured human corneal and conjunctival cells. The in vitro
antimicrobial activity was tested on Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-Resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae,
Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus mitis. For each microbial strain 10 μL
of a 0.5 MacFarland standardized bacterial inoculum were incubated at 25 °C with 
100 μL of ophthalmic solution for up to 6 h. After different periods of time,
samples were inoculated on blood agar with 5% sheep blood. Moreover, a 0.5
MacFarland bacterial inoculum was seeded in triplicate on Mueller-Hinton Agar or 
on Mueller-Hinton Fastidious Agar; then a cellulose disc soaked with 50 μL of
ophthalmic solution was applied on the surface of agar and plates were incubated 
for 18 h at 37 °C, in order to evaluate the inhibition of bacterial growth around
the disc. Human corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells in vitro were incubated
for 5, 10 and 15 min with Keratosept or its components. The cytotoxicity was
assessed through the release of cytoplasmic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
into the medium immediately after exposure to the drugs; the
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was
performed to evaluate the metabolic cell activity. Our results show that
Keratosept ophthalmic solution gave an average logarithmic (log) reduction of
bacterial load of 2.14 ± 0.35 within 6 h of exposure (p-value < 0.05 versus
control saline solution). On agar plates, all microbial strains, excluding P.
Aeruginosa, showed an inhibition zone of growth around the Keratosept-soaked
discs. Keratosept and its components after 5 and 10 min did not show any
cytotoxic effect on cultured corneal and conjunctival cells, and only after
15 min a significant reduction of cell viability and an increase of cytotoxicity 
compared to control (vehicle) was seen; dexpanthenol 5% and polyvinyl alcohol
accelerated the wounding of corneal cells in vitro. In conclusion, Keratosept
showed good antimicrobial activity on the tested strains; the ophthalmic solution
and its components were safe and non-toxic for the corneal and conjunctival
epithelial cells for 5 and 10 min at the concentrations analyzed, and
dexpanthenol 5% and polyvinyl alcohol promoted the wounding of corneal cells.
