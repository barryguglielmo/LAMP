Dysbiosis of the skin microbiota is increasingly implicated as a contributor to
the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD). We previously reported first-in-human
safety and clinical activity results from topical application of the commensal
skin bacterium Roseomonas mucosa for the treatment of AD in 10 adults and 5
children older than 9 years of age. Here, we examined the potential mechanism of 
action of R. mucosa treatment and its impact on children with AD less than 7
years of age, the most common age group for children with AD. In 15 children with
AD, R. mucosa treatment was associated with amelioration of disease severity,
improvement in epithelial barrier function, reduced Staphylococcus aureus burden 
on the skin, and a reduction in topical steroid requirements without severe
adverse events. Our observed response rates to R. mucosa treatment were greater
than those seen in historical placebo control groups in prior AD studies. Skin
improvements and colonization by R. mucosa persisted for up to 8 months after
cessation of treatment. Analyses of cellular scratch assays and the MC903 mouse
model of AD suggested that production of sphingolipids by R. mucosa, cholinergic 
signaling, and flagellin expression may have contributed to therapeutic impact
through induction of a TNFR2-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. These
results suggest that a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of R. mucosa
treatment in individuals with AD is warranted and implicate commensals in the
maintenance of the skin epithelial barrier.
