Antimicrobial resistance is a common iatrogenic complication of modern life and
medical care. One of the most demonstrative examples is the exponential increase 
in the incidence of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) production among
Enterobacteriaceae, that is, the most common human pathogens outside of the
hospital setting. Infections resulting from ESBL-producing bacteria are
associated with devastating outcomes, now affecting even previously healthy
individuals. This poses an enormous burden and threat to public health. This
article aims to narrate the evolving epidemiology of ESBL infections and
highlights current challenges in terms of management and prevention of these
common infections.
