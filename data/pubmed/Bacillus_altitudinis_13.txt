An indole-3-acetic acid producing Bacillus altitudinis WR10 was previously
isolated from the root of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). In this study, the strain
WR10 was used for relieving abiotic stresses in wheat under low phosphorus and
high saline in hydroponic co-culture models. Significantly, strain WR10 improved 
wheat seed relative germination rate under salinity stress (200/400 mM NaCl) and 
the root dry weight in wheat seedlings under phosphorus stress (10 Î¼M KH2PO3)
when insoluble phosphates are available. To provide insights into its abiotic
stress-alleviating properties, the strain was characterized further. WR10 grows
well under different culture conditions. Particularly, WR10 resists salt (12%
NaCl) and hydrolyzes both inorganic and organic insoluble phosphates. WR10 uses
many plant-derived substrates as sole carbon and energy sources. It produces
catalase, amylase, phosphatase, phytase, reductase, and
1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase. In addition, WR10 possesses
long peritrichous flagella, and its biofilm formation, as well as phytase
production, is induced by abiotic stresses. Overall, the salinity-alleviating
property of WR10 in wheat can be attributed to its inherent tolerance to NaCl,
formation of biofilm, and production of enzymes, like catalase, amylase, and ACC 
deaminase. Meanwhile, B. altitudinis WR10 reduces low-phosphorus stress in wheat 
by production of phosphatases and phytases in the presence of insoluble
phosphates.
