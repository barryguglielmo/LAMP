This study aimed to evaluate the effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG on growth
of Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes, inoculated alone or in
combination on surface of Minas Frescal cheeses, during storage for 21 days at
7 °C. Survival percentages of each individual bacterial species after exposure to
in vitro simulated gastrointestinal conditions (SGC) were also determined. The
addition of L. rhamnosus did not affect (P > 0.05) pH, moisture, fat, protein and
texture profile of Minas Frescal cheeses. L. rhamnosus was able to survive in
suitable counts (>6 Log CFU/g) in cheeses from the 7th day of storage, with high 
survival (>74.6-86.4%) after SGC. An inhibitory effect of L. rhamnosus on L.
monocytogenes was observed in cheeses (decrease of 1.1-1.6 Log CFU/g) and after
SGC (20% reduction in the survival). No inhibitory effect of L. rhamnosus was
observed on S. aureus counts (P > 0.05), and this microorganism did not survive
the exposure to SGC. In conclusion, the addition of L. rhamnosus in Minas Frescal
cheese has a potential for L. monocytogenes inhibition. Further studies are
necessary to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the inhibition process and
determine the survival ability of the bacterial species evaluated in in vivo
experiments.
