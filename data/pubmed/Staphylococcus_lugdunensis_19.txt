Rapid identification from positive blood cultures is standard of care (SOC) in
many clinical microbiology laboratories. The GenMark Dx ePlex Blood Culture
Identification Gram-Positive (BCID-GP) Panel is a multiplex nucleic acid
amplification assay based on competitive DNA hybridization and electrochemical
detection using eSensor technology. This multicenter study compared the
investigational-use-only (IUO) BCID-GP Panel to other methods of identification
of 20 Gram-positive bacteria, four antimicrobial resistance genes, and both Pan
Candida and Pan Gram-Negative targets that are unique to the BCID-GP Panel. Ten
microbiology laboratories throughout the United States collected residual,
deidentified positive blood culture samples for analysis. Five laboratories
tested both clinical and contrived samples with the BCID-GP Panel. Comparator
identification methods included each laboratory's SOC, which included
matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry
(MALDI-TOF MS) and automated identification systems as well as targeted
PCR/analytically validated real-time PCR (qPCR) with bidirectional sequencing. A 
total of 2,342 evaluable samples (1,777 clinical and 565 contrived) were tested
with the BCID-GP Panel. The overall sample accuracy for on-panel organisms was
89% before resolution of discordant results. For pathogenic Gram-positive targets
(Bacillus cereus group, Enterococcus spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus
faecium, Staphylococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, 
Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Listeria spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus 
spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus anginosus group, Streptococcus
pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes), positive percent agreement (PPA) and
negative percent agreement (NPA) ranged from 93.1% to 100% and 98.8% to 100%,
respectively. For contamination rule-out targets (Bacillus subtilis group,
Corynebacterium, Cutibacterium acnes, Lactobacillus, and Micrococcus), PPA and
NPA ranged from 84.5% to 100% and 99.9% to 100%, respectively. Positive percent
agreement and NPA for the Pan Candida and Pan Gram-Negative targets were 92.4%
and 95.7% for the former and 99.9% and 99.6% for the latter. The PPAs for
resistance markers were as follows: mecA, 97.2%; mecC, 100%; vanA, 96.8%; and
vanB, 100%. Negative percent agreement ranged from 96.6% to 100%. In conclusion, 
the ePlex BCID-GP Panel compares favorably to SOC and targeted molecular methods 
for the identification of 20 Gram-positive pathogens and four antimicrobial
resistance genes in positive blood culture bottles. This panel detects a broad
range of pathogens and mixed infections with yeast and Gram-negative organisms
from the same positive blood culture bottle.
