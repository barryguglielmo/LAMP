This study reports the draft genome sequence of a promising fish probiotic,
Bacillus subtilis strain WS1A, that possesses antimicrobial activity against
Aeromonas veronii and suppressed motile Aeromonas septicemia in Labeo rohita The 
de novo assembly resulted in an estimated chromosome size of 4,148,460 bp, with
4,288 open reading frames.
