BACKGROUND: Epsilon toxin (ETX) causes a commonly fatal enterotoxemia in domestic
animals. Also, ETX causes serious economic losses to animal husbandry. In this
study, we selected several clones against ETX using repertoires displayed on
filamentous phage. Anti-ETX specific clones were enriched by binding to
immobilized antigen, followed by elution and re-propagation of phage. After
multiple rounds of binding selection, ELISA analysis showed that most isolated
clones had high affinity and specificity for ETX.
RESULTS: Two recombinant monoclonal antibodies against ETX were isolated by phage
display technology. B1 phage VH antibody isolated from DAb library and G2 soluble
scFv antibody isolated from Tomlinson I + J libraries have been applied as the
capture and detection antibodies for developing an ETX sandwich ELISA test,
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Designed ETX sandwich ELISA could be a valuable tool for
quantitative detection of ETX in inactivated commercial vaccines against
enterotoxemia.
