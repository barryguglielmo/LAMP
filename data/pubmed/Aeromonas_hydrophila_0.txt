We highlight 2 cases of immunocompetent pediatric patients diagnosed with
osteomyelitis and cellulitis attributed to Aeromonas hydrophila. One case had a
direct water source; however, the second case occurred following a wild hog bite.
Both required fluoroquinolone treatment and demonstrated the need to consider A. 
hydrophila in patients with water exposure, animal bites and initial antibiotic
failure.
