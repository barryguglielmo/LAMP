The gut bacterium Gordonibacter urolithinfaciens DSM 27213 metabolizes ellagic
acid into three polyphenol compounds, namely, urolithin M5, urolithin M6, and
urolithin C, which are collectively called urolithin. The key reactions of this
metabolic pathway are the dehydroxylation of the phenolic hydroxy group, i.e.,
conversion of urolithin M5 to urolithin M6, and successive conversion of
urolithin M6 to urolithin C. By testing the effects of various
electron-transferring compounds on the dehydroxylation reactions, methylviologen 
was found to effectively support the dehydroxylation catalyzed by the cell free
extracts. The urolithin dehydroxylating enzymes were found in the soluble
fraction of the cell free extracts. The urolithin dehydroxylation was found to be
coupled with reduction of dicationic methylviologen to a cation radical form
catalyzed by enzymes with hydrogen as an electron donor, which was also found
with the soluble fraction. Further investigation of the reaction in the presence 
of natural cofactors with or without methylviologen and hydrogen revealed the
involvement of NADPH and FAD in the electron transportation systems of the
urolithin dehydroxylation.
