In this paper, we studied the crack-repair by spraying bacteria-based liquid
around the cracks in concrete. To enhance the repair efficiency and speed up the 
repair process, the transposon mutagenesis method was employed to modify the
genes of Bacillus halodurans and create a mutant bacterial strain with higher
efficiency of calcium carbonate productivity by catalyzing the combination of
carbonate and calcium ion. The efficiency of crack-repairing in concrete by
spraying two kinds of bacterial liquid was evaluated via image analysis, X-ray
computed tomography (X-CT) scanning technology and the sorptivity test. The
results show that the crack-repair efficiency was enhanced very evidently by
spraying genetically modified bacterial-liquid as no microbiologically induced
calcite precipitation (MICP) was found within the cracks for concrete samples
sprayed using wild type bacterial-liquid. In addition, the crack-repair process
was also shortened significantly in the case of genetically modified bacteria.
