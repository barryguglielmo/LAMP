Crocin, one of the major carotenoid pigments of Crocus sativus (saffron), is
responsible for antioxidant activity, neuroprotection, and the inhibition of
tumor cell proliferation. In order to improve the functionality of crocin,
α-glucosyl-(1→6)-trans-crocins (C-Gs) were synthesized using sucrose and
dextransucrase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides. High hydrostatic pressure (HHP)
technique was applied to the synthesis process of C-Gs in order to improve its
transglucosylation yield. A 100 MPa HHP condition enhanced the production yield
of C-Gs by 1.95 times compared to that of 0.1 MPa atmospheric pressure. Novel
C-Gs were purified by HPLC, and their chemical structures were determined using
NMR analysis. Novel C-Gs increased water solubility 4.6-5.7 times and antioxidant
activity 1.5-2.6 times, respectively, compared to crocin, and their
neuroprotections (cell viability 92.5-100.4 %) on HT22 mouse hippocampal neuronal
cells were significantly higher than that of crocin (cell viability 84.6 %). This
advanced neuroprotection of novel C-Gs could be highly associated with their
enhanced antioxidant activity. Thus, the enhanced water solubility and
functionality of novel C-Gs can induce better clinical efficacy of
neuroprotection than trans-crocin.
