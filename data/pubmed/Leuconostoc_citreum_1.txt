Food consumers make decisions primarily on the basis of a product's nutritional, 
functional, and sensorial aspects. In this context, this study evaluated the
persistence in sourdough of a multistrain starter culture from laboratory to
bakery plant production and the effect of the starter on antioxidant and
rheological properties of sourdoughs and derived bread. Lactobacillus
sanfranciscensis B450, Leuconostoc citreum B435, and Candida milleri L999 were
used as a multispecies starter culture to produce a sourdough subsequently used
to modify two traditional sourdoughs to make novel bread with improved health and
rheological properties. Both these novel bakery sourdoughs showed the persistence
of L. sanfranciscensis B450 and C. milleri L999, and showed a significantly
different lactic acid bacteria (LAB) concentration from the traditional
sourdoughs. The novel sourdough PF7 M had a higher phenolic content (170%
increase) and DPPH (8% increase) than the traditional bakery sourdough PF7 F. The
novel sourdough PF9 M exhibited an improvement in textural parameters. Further
research would be useful on the bioavailability of bio-active compounds to obtain
bread with improved characteristics.
