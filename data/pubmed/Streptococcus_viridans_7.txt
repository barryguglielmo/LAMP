OBJECTIVES: A substantial proportion of infective endocarditis (IE) cases are
complicated by local invasion. The purpose of this study was to identify patient 
and disease characteristics associated with local invasion in surgically treated 
IE patients.
METHODS: This was a nested case-control study. All episodes of IE for patients
admitted to Cleveland Clinic from January 1st, 2013 - June 30th, 2016 were
identified from the Cleveland Clinic IE Registry. Patients ≥18years of age who
underwent surgery for IE were included. Amongst these, cases were those with
local invasion, controls were those without. Local invasion, defined as
periannular extension, paravalvular abscess, intracardiac fistula, or
pseudoaneurysm, was ascertained from the surgical operative note. Associations of
selected factors with local invasion were examined in a multivariable logistic
regression model.
RESULTS: Among 511 patients who met inclusion criteria, 215 had local invasion.
Mean age was 56years; 369 were male. Overall 345 (68%) had aortic valve, 228
(45%) mitral valve, and 66 (13%) tricuspid or pulmonic valve involvement. Aortic 
valve involvement (OR 6.23, 95% CI 3.55 - 11.44), bioprosthetic valve (OR 3.88,
95% CI 2.36 - 6.44), significant paravalvular leak (OR 3.80, 95% CI 1.60 - 9.89),
new atrioventricular nodal block (OR 3.77, 95% CI 1.87 - 7.90), infection with
streptococci other than viridans group streptococci (OR 7.54, 95% CI 2.42 -
24.87), and presence of central nervous system emboli (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.13 -
3.04) were associated with local invasion.
CONCLUSIONS: Intra-cardiac and microorganism factors, but not comorbid
conditions, are associated with local invasion in IE.
