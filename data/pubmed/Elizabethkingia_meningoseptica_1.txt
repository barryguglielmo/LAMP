Cadmium (Cd) is a hazardous pollutant known to exert various toxic effects and
other sublethal effects on aquatic organisms, and induce a variety of adverse
effects on human health, and can be commonly found in environment. The aim of
this study was to explore the effects of waterborne Cd exposure on the intestinal
microbiota, and Cd accumulation and oxidative response in Carassius auratus
gibelio (C. gibelio). The fish were exposed to waterborne Cd at 0, 1, 2, and
4 mg/L for 30 days. Waterborne Cd exposure resulted marked alterations in the
composition of microbiota. At the genus level, Bacteroides, Aeromonas,
Akkermansia, Acinetobacter, Chryseobacterium, Shinella, Cetobacterium and
Bacillus were significantly changed in Cd groups. The results obtained indicate
that Cd exposure significantly increased the bioaccumulation level of Cd and
profoundly affected antioxidant enzyme including superoxide dismutase (SOD),
catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH), total antioxidant (T-AOC), malonaldehyde
(MDA), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST). The present findings may provide a
new framework for the role of gut microbiota in the response to environmental
chemical contamination and in the pathogenesis of body disorders.
