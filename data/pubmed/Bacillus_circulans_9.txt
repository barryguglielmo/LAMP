Hydrolysis efficiency of β-galactosidases is affected due to a strong inhibition 
by galactose, hampering the complete lactose hydrolysis. One alternative to
reduce this inhibition is to perform mutations in the enzyme's active site. The
aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of point mutations on the active
site of different microbial β-galactosidases, using computational techniques. The
enzymes of Aspergillus niger (AnβGal), Aspergillus oryzae (AoβGal), Bacillus
circulans (BcβGal), Bifidobacterium bifidum (BbβGal), and Kluyveromyces lactis
(KlβGal) were used. The mutations were carried out in all residues that were up
to 4.5 Å from the galactose/lactose molecules and binding energy was computed.
The mutants Tyr96Ala (AnβGal), Asn140Ala and Asn199Ala (AoβGal), Arg111Ala and
Glu355Ala (BcβGal), Arg122Ala and Phe358Ala (BbβGal), Tyr523Ala, Phe620Ala, and
Trp582Ala (KlβGal) had the best results, with higher effect on galactose binding 
energy and lower effect on lactose affinity. To maximize enzyme reactions by
reducing galactose affinity, double mutations were proposed for BcβGal, BbβGal,
and KlβGal. The double mutations in BcβGal and BbβGal caused the highest
reduction in galactose affinity, while no satisfactory results were observed to
KlβGal. Using computational tools, mutants that reduced galactose affinity
without significantly affecting lactose binding were proposed. The mutations
proposed can be used to reduce the negative feedback process, improving the
catalytic characteristics of β-galactosidases and rendering them promising for
industrial applications.
