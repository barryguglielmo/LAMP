BACKGROUND: We intend to assess the efficacies and limitations of collagenase
clostridium histolyticum (CCH) and fasciectomy in treating Dupuytren's
contracture, and the associated complications and rate of recurrences aiming to
present a treatment algorithm.
METHODS: A literature search within the PubMed, Web of Sciences, Cochrane
Library, and EMBASE databases was performed using the combined key words
'Dupuytren, palmar aponeurosis contracture, collagenase clostridium histolyticum 
and fasciectomy', including all possible studies with a set of predefined
inclusion and exclusion criteria.
RESULTS: Thirty studies were assessed for eligibility from 215 identified
records. Seventeen publications satisfied the inclusion criteria including 2142
joints in 1784 patients. The mean follow-up time was 18.0 months (3-60).
CONCLUSION: Acceptable contractures release was obtained in both techniques.
Severe complications associated with fasciectomy outrank those of CCH, whereas
the low rate of recurrence favors the fasciectomy technique.
