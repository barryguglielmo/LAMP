This study investigated the suppressive effect of exercise preconditioning
against colitis induced by high-fat diet (HF) plus dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)
in wild-type mice. Male mice (C57BL/6) aged 6 weeks were assigned to standard
chow (SC, n = 10) or HF (n = 10) or HF followed by DSS (HF+DSS, n = 10) or
exercise preconditioning (EX) followed by HF+DSS (EX+HF+DSS, n = 10) for a total 
of 15 weeks. After 12 weeks of dietary treatments and/or exercise
preconditioning, mice in the DSS groups were subjected to administration of 2
cycles of 5-day DSS (2% w/v) with a 7-day interval between cycles. HF resulted in
colitis symptoms and histological changes, infiltration of immunity cells,
decreased gut barrier proteins, increased pro-inflammatory and chemotactic
cytokines and decreased anti-inflammatory cytokine such as adiponectin, which
deteriorated after administration of DSS. Exercise preconditioning alleviated
HF+DSS-induced colitis and caused significant modifications in gut microbiota:
decreased Bacteroides vulgatus (p = 0.050) and increased Akkermansia muciniphila 
(p = 0.050). The current findings suggest that exercise preconditioning
attenuates the severity of HF+DSS-induced colitis in C57BL/6 mice.
