This study assessed the feasibility and benefits of high intensity interval
training (HIIT) plus lifestyle education among inactive adults with celiac
disease. 41 participants were randomized to receive the intervention (HIIT+) for 
12-weeks or waitlist control (WLC). Testing was completed at baseline,
immediately post- and 3-months post-intervention. Generalized estimating
equations were used to assess changes in the outcome variables over time between 
the groups. Mean percent of age-predicted maximum heart rate was 97.9% and
average rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was 6.33 (out of 10) during HIIT
intervals. Following the intervention, the HIIT+ group showed enrichment in
relative abundance of Parabacteroides and Defluviitaleaceae_UCG¬_011 while WLC
showed enrichment in relative abundance of Roseburia intestinalis, Klebsiella and
Adlercreutzia. A unique set of taxa were differentially abundant between the
groups at 3-months post-intervention. HIIT+ participants experienced a reduction 
in resting heart rate (-6.6 bpm) immediately post-intervention compared to WLC.
Further research is needed to establish an optimal HIIT protocol that may improve
VO2max and metabolic syndrome biomarkers. Findings from this pilot study provide 
preliminary evidence that a HIIT+ intervention is feasible for inactive adults
with celiac disease and leads to favourable changes in resting HR alongside
potentially beneficial shifts in gut microbiota. Trial registration number:
ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT03520244 Novelty • High intensity interval training 
leads to potentially beneficial changes in the gut microbiota of adults with
celiac disease. • A high intensity interval training exercise intervention is
feasible and well tolerated for patients with celiac disease.
