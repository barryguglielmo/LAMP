BACKGROUND: Vascular reconstruction is required to treat infectious intracranial 
aneurysms (IIAs) on arteries supplying the eloquent area. However,
extracranial-intracranial bypass is sometimes impossible because IIAs are
frequently located distally on arteries and the length of a donor artery is
limited. We report a rare case of an unruptured Gemella morbillorum IIA, which
was successfully treated by intracranial-intracranial (IC-IC) bypass using a
Y-shaped superficial temporal artery (STA) interposition graft.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 52-year-old man presented with heart failure and an
unruptured IIA in the right anterior parietal artery because of acute
G. morbillorum endocarditis. The patient was treated with urgent replacement of
cardiac valves and antibiotic therapy. However, the IIA increased in size during 
the following 1 month, and therefore was treated surgically to prevent the
rupture. End-to-side IC-IC bypass using a Y-shaped STA graft followed by
aneurysmal trapping was performed to overcome the limited length of the STA as a 
donor artery to prevent cerebral ischemia in the artery territory and to avoid
direct injury to the sensory cortex adhering tightly to the IIA. Postoperative
courses were uneventful, and he recovered from the infectious diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that end-to-side IC-IC bypass using a Y-shaped
STA graft can be a good option for surgical treatment of IIAs, which are located 
in eloquent areas.
