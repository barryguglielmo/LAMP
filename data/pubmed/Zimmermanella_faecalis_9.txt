PURPOSE: To determine the empirical usage of antibiotics and analyze the pathogen
spectrum during the perioperative period of flexible ureteroscopic lithotripsy
(FURSL) with a focus on levofloxacin.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 754 patients who
underwent FURSL successfully in our hospital from January 2015 to July 2019. All 
patients were indicated urine cultures and prescribed antibiotics during the
perioperative period. Patients with negative preoperative urine cultures were
divided into levofloxacin (LVXG) and non-levofloxacin groups (NLVXG) based on the
empirical use of antibiotics. Operative time, the length of postoperative
hospital stays and total hospital stays, total hospitalization costs,
postoperative fever rate and removal rate of stones were compared. Patients with 
positive urine cultures were analyzed for Â pathogen distribution and antibiotic
resistance.
RESULTS: In the empirical use of antibiotics among 541 cases with negative urine 
cultures, the prescription rate of levofloxacin was 68.95%. Compared to that in
NLVXG, LVXG had a lower cost of antibiotics but higher postoperative fever rate
and longer hospital stay. There were no significant differences in operative
time, the total hospitalization costs and the removal rate of stones between the 
two groups. The top two common pathogens were Escherichia coli (36.11%) and
Enterococcus faecalis (24.07%), with resistance rates of 74.36% and 71.15% to
levofloxacin, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Levofloxacin might be no longer suitable as the first-line choice of 
clinical experience when performing FURSL in our center.
