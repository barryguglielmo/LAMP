Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with increased colorectal cancer (CRC)
incidence risk and mortality. Vitamin D mediates its action through the binding
of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), and polymorphisms of the VDR might explain these
inverse associations. The aim of the study was the investigation of the relevance
of rs731236; Thermus aquaticus I (TaqI), rs7975232; Acetobacter pasteurianus sub.
pasteurianus I (ApaI), rs2228570; Flavobacterium okeanokoites I (FokI) and
rs1544410, Bacillus stearothermophilus I (BsmI) polymorphisms of the VDR gene to 
colorectal carcinogenesis (CRC) and progression. Peripheral blood was obtained
from 397 patients with early operable stage II/III (n = 202) and stage IV (n =
195) CRC. Moreover, samples from 100 healthy donors and 40 patients with
adenomatous polyps were also included as control groups. Genotyping in the
samples from patients and controls was performed using polymerase chain
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP). A significant
association was revealed between all four polymorphisms and cancer. Individuals
with homozygous mutant (tt, aa, ff or bb) genotypes were more susceptible to the 
disease (p < 0.001). All of the mutant genotypes detected were also significantly
associated with stage IV (p < 0.001), leading to significantly decreased survival
(p < 0.001). Moreover, all four polymorphisms were significantly associated with 
KRAS (Kirsten ras oncogene) mutations and Toll-like receptor (TLR2, TLR4 and
TLR9) genetic variants. In multivariate analysis, tt, aa and ff genotypes emerged
as independent factors associated with decreased overall survival (OS) (p =
0.001, p < 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively). The detection of higher
frequencies of the VDR polymorphisms in CRC patients highlights the role of these
polymorphisms in cancer development and progression.
