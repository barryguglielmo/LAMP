OBJECTIVE: To study, in a multi-institutional setting, the efficacy/safety
outcomes in acute phase Peyronie's disease (PD) of multiple high-volume centers
employing CCH to treat PD, which is defined as the abnormal formation of fibrous 
plaque(s) in the tunica albuginea of the penis. It is a chronic condition that
afflicts 3%-13% of the US male population. There is no current
multi-institutional research on the efficacy and safety of collagenase
Clostridium histolyticum (CCH) in the treatment of acute phase PD.
METHODS: Retrospective data were collected for consecutive patients with PD who
underwent treatment with CCH between April 2014 and March 2018 at 5 institutions.
918 patients were included. Patients with duration of PD no longer than 6 months 
at presentation qualified as being in the acute phase of PD. Main outcomes of
interest include the change in curvature after receiving CCH therapy, and
frequency of serious treatment-related adverse events. Successful improvement in 
curvature is defined as an at least 20% decrease in penile curvature from
baseline after CCH therapy.
RESULTS: A total of 918 patients were included in the analysis, of which 134
(14.6%) qualified as acute phase PD (group 1) and the remaining 784 (85.4%)
qualified as stable phase (group 2). Mean duration of PD was 4.44 ± 1.68 months
for group 1, and 40.8 ± 61.2 months for group 2. There was no significant
difference in final change in curvature between acute and stable phase of PD
(13.5° vs 15.6°, P = .09). There was no statistically significant difference in
frequency of treatment-related adverse events between the acute phase (16
patients, 11.9%) and the stable phase (77 patients, 9.8%; P = .44). In our
multivariate analysis, only number of CCH cycles received was predictive of
improvement of curvature.
CONCLUSION: This large multi-institutional analysis confirms that CCH therapy is 
as safe and efficacious in acute phase PD as it is in stable phase PD.
