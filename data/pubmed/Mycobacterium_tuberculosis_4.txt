Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most fatal diseases and is responsible for the
infection of millions of people around the world. Most recently, scientific
frontiers have been engaged to develop new drugs that can overcome drug-resistant
TB. Following this direction, using a designed scaffold based on the combination 
of two separate pharmacophoric groups, a series of menadione-derived selenoesters
was developed with good yields. All products were evaluated for their in vitro
activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv and attractive results were
observed, especially for the compounds 8a, 8c and 8f (MICs 2.1, 8.0 and 8.1 μM,
respectively). In addition, 8a, 8c and 8f demonstrated potent in vitro activity
against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates (CDCT-16 and CDCT-27) with
promising MIC values ranging from 0.8 to 3.1 μM. Importantly, compounds 8a and 8c
were found to be non-toxic against the Vero cell line. The SI value of 8a (>23.8)
was found to be comparable to that of isoniazid (>22.7), which suggests the
possibility of carrying out advanced studies on this derivative. Therefore, these
menadione-derived selenoesters obtained as hybrid compounds represent promising
new anti-tubercular agents to overcome TB multidrug resistance.
