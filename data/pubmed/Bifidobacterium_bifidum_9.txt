Bifidobacteria are among the first colonisers of the gastrointestinal tract of
breast-fed newborns due to, among other things, their ability to metabolise
oligosaccharides naturally occurring in human milk. The presence of
bifidobacteria in the infant gut has been shown to promote intestinal health and 
homeostasis as well as to preserve a functional gut barrier, thus positively
influencing host health and well-being. Among human-associated gut commensals,
Bifidobacterium bifidum has been described as the only species capable of the
extracellular degradation of both mucin-type glycans and HMOs, thereby giving
this species a special role as a commensal gut forager of both host and
diet-derived glycans. In the present study, we assess the possible beneficial
properties and probiotic potential of B. bifidum strain CNCM I-4319. In silico
genome analysis and growth experiments confirmed the expected ability of this
strain to consume HMOs and mucin. By employing various animal models, we were
also able to assess the ability of B. bifidum CNCM I-4319 to preserve gut
integrity and functionality from stress-induced and inflammatory damage, thereby 
enforcing its potential as an effective probiotic strain.
