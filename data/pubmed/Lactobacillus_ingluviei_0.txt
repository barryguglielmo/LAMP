Probiotics are growing alternatives to antibiotics, and can contribute to the
prevention and treatment of diseases and enhance livestock production.
Lactobacillus (L.) ingluviei is a novel probiotic species with growth-enhancement
effects; however, this species remains poorly understood, and there have been (to
our knowledge) no studies focusing on its immunological effects. Here, we
isolated L. ingluviei C37 (LIC37) from chicken and evaluated the bacterium's
immunomodulatory properties to explore its probiotic potential. Real-time
quantitative PCR and ELISA showed that in vitro exposure of
inflammation-stimulated mouse peritoneal macrophages to heat-killed LIC37 led to 
decreases in tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin (IL)-6 levels and an
increase in IL-10. These findings suggested that LIC37 exerts anti-inflammatory
effects by modulating cytokine profiles. This species may be an attractive
probiotic bacterial strain for use in animal production.
