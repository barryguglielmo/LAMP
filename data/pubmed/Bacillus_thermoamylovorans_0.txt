Thermotolerant bacteria producing medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoate
(mcl-PHA) were isolated from various thermal sites, including palm oil mill
effluent, textile wastewater, and hot spring water, in Thailand. Fifteen strains 
were isolated at 45 °C using nutrient-rich (NR) medium. However, only six
isolates produced mcl-PHA at 0.41 ± 0.01 g/L to 0.80 ± 0.01 g/L, representing a
mcl-PHA content of 29.44% to 50.77% of the dry cell weight (DCW). The six strains
of bacterial isolates could utilise a variety of substrates; all were identified 
as Bacillus thermoamylovorans. The highest mcl-PHA content (50.77% of the DCW)
was accumulated by the B. thermoamylovorans strain PHA005 isolated from palm oil 
mill effluent. The mcl-PHA from strain PHA005 was composed of five different
monomers, 3-hydroxyoctanoate (3HO), 3-hydroxydecanoate (3HD),
3-hydroxytetradecanoate (3HTD), 3-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid (3HHD), and
3-hydroxyoctadecanoic (3HOD), with a monomer content of 24.12, 15.50, 13.00,
39.25, and 8.13 mol%, respectively. The optimum temperature for B.
thermoamylovorans strain PHA005 growth is 45 °C, and it can survive at up to
60 °C. This is a first report of PHA synthesis by a thermotolerant B.
thermoamylovorans. Moreover, the high content of 3HHD monomers (39.25 mol%) has
never been reported in Bacillus.
