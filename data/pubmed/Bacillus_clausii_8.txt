AIM: This study determined the optimum gamma irradiation dosage to sterilize
sodium hyaluronate (HY), single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT), multi-walled
carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and CNT functionalized with HY (HY-SWCNT and HY-MWCNT), 
evaluated the structural integrity of the materials and assessed whether
sterilized materials kept biological properties without affecting renal function.
MAIN METHODS: Materials were submitted to dosages of 100 gγ to 30 Kgγ and plated 
onto agar mediums for colony forming units (CFUs) counting. Sterilized samples
were inoculated with 107Bacillus clausii, submitted again to gamma irradiation,
and plated in agar mediums for CFUs counting. Scanning electron microscope was
used for structural evaluation of sterilized materials. Tooth sockets of rats
were treated with sterilized materials for bone formation assessment and renal
function of the animals was analyzed.
KEY FINDINGS: The optimum gamma dosage for sterilization was 250 gγ for HY and
2.5 Kgγ for the other materials without meaningful structural changes. Sterilized
materials significantly increased bone formation (p < 0.05) and they did not
compromise renal function and structure.
SIGNIFICANCE: Gamma irradiation efficiently sterilized HY, SWCNT, MWCNT, HY-SWCNT
and HY-MWCNT without affecting structural aspects while maintaining their
desirable biological properties.
