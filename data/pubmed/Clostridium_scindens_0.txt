Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an emerging alphavirus, has infected millions of
people. However, the factors modulating disease outcome remain poorly understood.
Here, we show in germ-free mice or in oral antibiotic-treated conventionally
housed mice with depleted intestinal microbiomes that greater CHIKV infection and
spread occurs within 1 day of virus inoculation. Alteration of the microbiome
alters TLR7-MyD88 signaling in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and blunts
systemic production of type I interferon (IFN). Consequently, circulating
monocytes express fewer IFN-stimulated genes and become permissive for CHIKV
infection. Reconstitution with a single bacterial species, Clostridium scindens, 
or its derived metabolite, the secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid, can restore 
pDC- and MyD88-dependent type I IFN responses to restrict systemic CHIKV
infection and transmission back to vector mosquitoes. Thus, symbiotic intestinal 
bacteria modulate antiviral immunity and levels of circulating alphaviruses
within hours of infection through a bile acid-pDC-IFN signaling axis, which
affects viremia, dissemination, and potentially transmission.
