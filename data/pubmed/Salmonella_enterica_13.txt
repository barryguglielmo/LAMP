The acquisition of antibiotic resistance (AR) by foodborne pathogens, such as
Salmonella enterica, has emerged as a serious public health concern. The
relationship between the two key survival mechanisms (i.e., antibiotic resistance
and virulence) of bacterial pathogens is complex. However, it is unclear if the
presence of certain virulence determinants (i.e., virulence genes) and AR have
any association in Salmonella. In this study, we report the prevalence of
selected virulence genes and their association with AR in a set of phenotypically
tested antibiotic-resistant (n = 117) and antibiotic-susceptible (n = 94)
clinical isolates of Salmonella collected from Tennessee, USA. Profiling of
virulence genes (i.e., virulotyping) in Salmonella isolates (n = 211) was
conducted by targeting 13 known virulence genes and a gene for class 1 integron. 
The association of the presence/absence of virulence genes in an isolate with
their AR phenotypes was determined by the machine learning algorithm Random
Forest. The analysis revealed that Salmonella virulotypes with gene clusters
consisting of avrA, gipA, sodC1, and sopE1 were strongly associated with any
resistant phenotypes. To conclude, the results of this exploratory study shed
light on the association of specific virulence genes with drug-resistant
phenotypes of Salmonella. The presence of certain virulence genes clusters in
resistant isolates may become useful for the risk assessment and management of
salmonellosis caused by drug-resistant Salmonella in humans.
