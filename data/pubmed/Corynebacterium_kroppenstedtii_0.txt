Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii is an emerging cause of granulomatous mastitis and
recurrent breast abscesses in women, but data on its clinical relevance in
non-gynecological disease conditions are limited. Here, we report the first case 
of a late-onset endocarditis of a native aortic valve in a 73-year old male
patient who presented with symptomatic aortic insufficiency. Echocardiography and
cardiac computed tomography revealed perforation of the non-coronary cusp and a
large perivalvular abscess cavity. Hence, surgical replacement of the aortic
valve and aortic root were performed. Intraoperatively obtained tissue specimens 
grew C. kroppenstedtii and the patient made a full recovery after a 6-week course
of antibiotic treatment. We briefly review the literature pertaining to
antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of C. kroppenstedtii and available
treatment recommendations. Our report calls for further studies to assess the
role of this bacterium as causative agent of infections other than granulomatous 
mastitis.
