BACKGROUND: Multifocal spherical nonstaining cavities and gram-positive,
rod-shaped, and endospore-forming bacteria were found in the liver of a sow that 
died suddenly. Clostridium novyi type B was identified and isolated from the
sudden death case, and the isolate was characterized by molecular analyses and
bioassays in the current study.
RESULTS: C. novyi was isolated from the liver of a sow that died suddenly and was
confirmed as C. novyi type B by differential PCR. The C. novyi isolate fermented 
glucose and maltose and demonstrated lecithinase activity, and the cell-free
culture supernatant of the C. novyi isolate exhibited cytotoxicity toward Vero
cells, demonstrating that the isolate produces toxins. In addition, whole-genome 
sequencing of the C. novyi isolate was performed, and the complete sequences of
the chromosome (2.29 Mbp) and two plasmids (134 and 68 kbp) were identified for
the first time. Based on genome annotation, 7 genes were identified as
glycosyltransferases, which are known as alpha toxins; 23 genes were found to be 
related to sporulation; 12 genes were found to be related to germination; and 20 
genes were found to be related to chemotaxis.
CONCLUSION: C. novyi type B was isolated from a sow in a sudden death case and
confirmed by biochemical and molecular characterization. Various
virulence-associated genes were identified for the first time based on
whole-genome sequencing.
