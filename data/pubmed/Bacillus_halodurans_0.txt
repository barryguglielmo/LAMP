RecJ homologs, which occur in virtually all prokaryotes and eukaryotes, play key 
roles in DNA damage repair and recombination. Current evidence shows that RecJ
family proteins exhibit exonuclease activity, degrading single-stranded nucleic
acids. Here, we report a novel RecJ isolated from Bacillus halodurans, which
utilizes double-stranded DNA as a substrate and functions as an endonuclease.
Bacillus halodurans RecJ (BhRecJ) cleaves supercoiled plasmids into open circular
and linear forms. Besides the typical domains of DHH, DHHA1, and
oligonucleotide-binding-fold, BhRecJ possesses a C-terminal domain with unknown
function, which might form the core of the endonuclease activity. Using
mutational analysis, we mapped several essential residues for BhRecJ endonuclease
activity. Our findings suggest that BhRecJ may be involved in biological
processes not typically associated with RecJ proteins.
