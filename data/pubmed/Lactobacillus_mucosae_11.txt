In the present study, we examined the effects of interleukin (IL)-10
expression-inducing bacteria Bifidobacterium adolescentis HP1, Lactobacillus
mucosae HP2, and Weissella cibaria HP3 on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and
liver steatosis in mice. Oral gavage of HP1, HP2, and HP3 reduced HFD-induced
bodyweight gain, triglycerides, and total cholesterol levels in the blood and
liver. They also suppressed HFD-induced colitis and the fecal δ,γ-Proteobacteria 
population. Of the tested bacteria, HP2, which most potently inhibited IL-10
expression, also suppressed HFD-induced bodyweight gain, liver steatosis, and
colitis most effectively. These findings suggest that IL-10 expression-inducing
gut bacteria can suppress obesity and liver steatosis.
