BACKGROUND: Tetanus is an infectious disease caused by clostridium tetani
secreting tetanus toxin in anaerobic environment. The fragment C of Tetanus toxin
(TTc) has been widely studied as a candidate vaccine to replace the existing
tetanus toxoid vaccine.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we established a simple method to purify recombinant
protein TTc with ion-exchange chromatography from Escherichia coli expression
systems.
METHODS: The TTc gene sequence was cloned into pET26b (+) vector and transferred 
to E. coli BL21 (DE3) for expression. The fermentation conditions (IPTG
concentration, Induction temperature, Induction time) were optimized to obtain
more soluble proteins. The soluble proteins were purified by Anion exchange
chromatography and Cation exchange chromatography. The sequence of columns in the
purification process was discussed. Finally, the stability of purified TTc
protein were determined, the secondary structure of the purified TTc protein was 
determined by circular dichroism. The molecular weight of the purified TTc
protein was determined by liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer. Furthermore, we
verified the immunogenicity of the purified protein in mice.
RESULTS: the purity of TTc improved from 34% to 88 % after the first anion
exchange column, and the final yield of recombinant TTc (purity > 95 %) can reach
84.79 % after the following cation exchange chromatography. The recombinant TTc
had a molecular weight of 51.737 KDa, was stable at 4 °C and weak alkaline
environment, was a β-sheet secondary structure, and had strong immunogenicity.
CONCLUSION: The purification method we developed might be an efficient method for
the industrial production of tetanus recombinant TTc vaccine.
