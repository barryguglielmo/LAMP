Effects of trehalose lipids produced from Rhodococcus erythropolis ATCC 4277 on
phenanthrene (PHE) mineralization by two soil microorganisms were investigated.
Biodegradation experiments were conducted, with and without the biosurfactant, in
three batch systems: water, soil, and soil-water slurry. PHE sorption to the soil
did not limit the mineralization by the test microorganisms, Pseudomonas strain R
(PR) and Sphingomonas sp. strain P5-2 (SP5-2). Both microorganisms, however,
demonstrated significant difference in the PHE mineralization capability in the
systems. While SP5-2 mineralized PHE faster than PR in liquid culture, PR having 
more hydrophobic surface greatly exceeded SP5-2 in ability to access soil-sorbed 
PHE. While the addition of the biosurfactant little affected the apparent cell
hydrophobicity of SP5-2, it substantially improved PHE mineralization by this
strain in all systems tested. Contrary to SP5-2, the apparent cell hydrophobicity
was significantly stimulated with increasing concentration of the biosurfactant
for PR. However, the biosurfactant had no significant effect on PHE
mineralization by this microorganism. The results demonstrated that the addition 
of the biosurfactant may have great potential for remediation of sites
contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons but its effects and benefits
may be dependent on characteristics of microorganisms involved and environmental 
conditions.
