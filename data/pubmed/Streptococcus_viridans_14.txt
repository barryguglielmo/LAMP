Infectious endocarditis (IE) remains one of the deadliest heart diseases with a
high death rate, generally following thrombo-embolic events. Today, therapy is
based on surgery and antibiotic therapy. When thromboembolic complications in IE 
patients persist, this is often due to our lack of knowledge regarding the
pathophysiological development and organization of cells in the vegetation, most 
notably the primordial role of platelets and further triggered hemostasis, which 
is related to the diversity of infectious microorganisms involved. Our objective 
was to study the organization of IE vegetations due to different bacteria species
in order to understand the related pathophysiological mechanism of vegetation
development. We present an approach for ultrastructural analysis of
whole-infected heart valve tissue based on scanning electron microscopy and
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Our approach allowed us to detect
differences in cell organization between the analyzed vegetations and revealed a 
distinct chemical feature in viridans Streptococci ones. Our results illustrate
the benefits that such an approach may bring for guiding therapy, considering the
germ involved for each IE patient.
