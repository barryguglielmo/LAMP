Gioddu, also known as "Miciuratu", "Mezzoraddu" or "Latte ischidu" (literally
meaning acidulous milk), is the sole variety of traditional Italian fermented
milk. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the microbiota and the
mycobiota occurring in artisan Gioddu sampled from three Sardinian producers by
combining the results of viable counting on selective culture media and
high-throughput sequencing. Physico-chemical parameters were also measured. The
overall low pH values (3.80-4.22) recorded in the analyzed Gioddu samples
attested the strong acidifying activity carried out by lactic acid bacteria
during fermentation. Viable counts revealed the presence of presumptive
lactococci, presumptive lactobacilli and non-Saccharomyces yeasts. A complex
(kefir-like) microbiota of bacteria and yeasts was unveiled through sequencing.
In more detail, Lactobacillus delbrueckii was found to dominate in Gioddu
together with Streptococcus thermophilus, thus suggesting the establishment of a 
yogurt-like protocooperation. Unexpectedly, in all the three analyzed batches
from two out of the three producers Lactobacillus kefiri was also detected, thus 
representing an absolute novelty, which suggests the presence of bioactive
compounds (e.g. exopolysaccharides) similar to those characterizing milk kefir
beverage. Mycobiota population, studied for the very first time in Gioddu,
revealed a more complex composition, with Kluyveromyces marxianus, Galactomyces
candidum and Geotrichum galactomyces constituting the core species. Further
research is needed to disclose the eventual occurence in Gioddu of probiotic
cultures and bioactive compounds (e.g. exopolysaccharides, angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitory peptides and antimicrobial compounds) with potential
health-benefits for the consumers.
