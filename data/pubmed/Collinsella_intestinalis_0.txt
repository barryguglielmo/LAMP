Dramatic increases in processed food consumption represent a global health
threat. Maillard reaction products (MRPs), which are common in processed foods,
form upon heat-induced reaction of amino acids with reducing sugars and include
advanced glycation end products with deleterious health effects. To examine how
processed foods affect the microbiota, we fed gnotobiotic mice, colonized with 54
phylogenetically diverse human gut bacterial strains, defined sugar-rich diets
containing whey as the protein source or a matched amino acid mixture. Whey or
ϵ-fructoselysine, an MRP in whey and many processed foods, selectively increases 
Collinsella intestinalis absolute abundance and induces Collinsella expression of
genomic loci directing import and metabolism of ϵ-fructoselysine to innocuous
products. This locus is repressed by glucose in C. aerofaciens, whose abundance
decreases with whey, but is not repressed in C. intestinalis. Identifying gut
organisms responding to and degrading potentially harmful processed food
components has implications for food science, microbiome science, and public
health.
