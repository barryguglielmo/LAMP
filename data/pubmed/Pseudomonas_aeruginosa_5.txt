Significant advances were made in antibiotic development during the past 5 years.
Novel agents were added to the arsenal that target critical priority pathogens,
including multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and carbapenem-resistant
Enterobacterales. Of these, 4 novel β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor combinations
(ceftolozane-tazobactam, ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, and
imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam) reached clinical approval in the United States.
With these additions comes a significant responsibility to reduce the possibility
of emergence of resistance. Reports in the rise of resistance toward
ceftolozane-tazobactam and ceftazidime-avibactam are alarming. Clinicians and
scientists must make every attempt to reverse or halt these setbacks.
