The drilling, processing and transportation of oil are the main sources of
pollution in water and soil. The current work analyzes the microbial diversity
and aromatic compounds degradation potential in the metagenomes of communities in
the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of a crude oil refinery. By focusing on the
degradation of phenol, we observed the involvement of diverse indigenous
microbial communities at different steps of the WWTP. The anaerobic bacterial and
archaeal genera were replaced by aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria
through the biological treatment processes. The phyla Proteobacteria,
Bacteroidetes and Planctomycetes were dominating at different stages of the
treatment. Most of the established protein sequences of the phenol degradation
key enzymes belonged to bacteria from the class Alphaproteobacteria. From 35
isolated strains, 14 were able to grow on aromatic compounds, whereas several
phenolic compound-degrading strains also degraded aliphatic hydrocarbons. Two
strains, Acinetobacter venetianus ICP1 and Pseudomonas oleovorans ICTN13, were
able to degrade various aromatic and aliphatic pollutants and were further
characterized by whole genome sequencing and cultivation experiments in the
presence of phenol to ascertain their metabolic capacity in phenol degradation.
When grown alone, the intermediates of catechol degradation, the meta or ortho
pathways, accumulated into the growth environment of these strains. In the mixed 
cultures of the strains ICP1 and ICTN13, phenol was degraded via cooperation, in 
which the strain ICP1 was responsible for the adherence of cells and ICTN13
diminished the accumulation of toxic intermediates.
