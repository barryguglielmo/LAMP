A molecular survey was conducted to understand recent distribution of pathogens
associated with canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) in Japan. Nasal
and/or pharyngeal swabs were collected from asymptomatic dogs and those with
CIRD, living in private house or in kennels. PCR-based examination was conducted 
for detecting nine pathogens. Among private household dogs, 50.8% with CIRD,
11.1% with respiratory disease other than CIRD, and 4.3% asymptomatic were
positive for more than one pathogen, whereas in kennel-housed dogs, 42.9% with
CIRD and 27.3% asymptomatic were positive. Bordetella bronchiseptica was most
frequently detected, followed by canine herpesvirus 1, canine parainfluenza
virus, canine pneumovirus, Mycoplasma cynos, and canine adenovirus type 2. In
kennel environment, asymptomatic dogs might act as reservoirs carrying the
respiratory pathogens.
