BACKGROUND: Marine fungi are an important repository of bioactive molecules with 
great potential in different technological fields, the annual number of new
compounds isolated from marine fungi is impressive and the general trend
indicates that it is still on the rise. In this context, the antifungal and
antimicrobial activity of the marine strain Mariannaea humicola IG100 was
evaluated and two active terpenoids were isolated and characterized.
METHODS: Preliminary screening of activity of marine strain IG100 was carried out
by agar plug diffusion methods against fungal (Penicillium griseofulvum TSF04)
and bacterial (Bacillus pumilus KB66 and Escherichia coli JM109) strains.
Subsequently, inhibition tests were done by using the cultural broth and the
organic extract (ethyl acetate, EtOAc) by the agar well diffusion methods. The
main active fractions were identified and tested for their antifungal activity
against P. griseofulvum TSF04 in a 24 wells microplate at different
concentrations (1000, 100, 10 and 1.0 µg/mL). Two active compounds were
characterized and their relative MIC measured by the broth micro-dilution methods
in a 96-well microplate against Aspergillus flavus IG133, P. griseofulvum TSF04, 
and Trichoderma pleuroticola IG137.
RESULTS: Marine strain IG100 presented significant antifungal activity associated
with two active compounds, the terpenoids terperstacin 1 and
19-acetyl-4-hydroxydictyodiol 2. Their MIC values were measured for A. flavus
(MIC of 7.9 µg/mL and 31.3 µg/mL for 1 and 2, respectively), P. griseofulvum (MIC
of 25 µg/mL and 100 µg/mL for 1 and 2, respectively) and T. pleuroticola
(MIC > 500 µg/mL and 125 µg/mL for 1 and 2, respectively). They showed a rather
good fungistatic effect.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the first marine strain of M. humicola (IG100) was
investigated for the production of bioactive molecules. Strain IG100 produced
significant amounts of two bioactive terpenoids, terperstacin 1 and
19-acetyl-4-hydroxydictyodiol 2. The two compounds showed significant antifungal 
activities against A. flavus IG133, T. pleuroticola IG137 and P. griseofulvum
TSF04. Compound 2 was identified for the first time in fungi.
