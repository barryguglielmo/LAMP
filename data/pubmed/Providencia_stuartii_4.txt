Anthocyanins are extensively studied for their health-related properties,
including antibacterial activity against urinary tract infections (UTI). Among
common fruits, blueberries, with their remarkable antioxidant capacity, are one
of the richest sources. Anthocyanin-rich extracts were obtained from four
varieties: Snowchaser, Star, Stella Blue and Cristina Blue, grown in the hot
climate of Southern Spain. Their total anthocyanins contents (TAC) were
determined spectrophotometrically, and the anthocyanin profile by ultra high
performance liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometer (UHPLC-MS/MS). Their
antioxidant activity was assessed by oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC)
assay, while antibacterial activity against strains isolated from UTI patients
was assessed in vitro, helping to select the varieties with the highest bioactive
potential. Star showed the highest TAC and antioxidant activity (1663 ± 159 mg of
cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (cy-3-O-glu) equivalents/100 g fresh weight (FW), 6345 ±
601 μmol Trolox equivalents (TE)/100 g FW, respectively), followed by Cristina
Blue, Stella Blue and Snowchaser. As far as we know, this is the first time that 
cyanidin-3-rutinoside has been identified in blueberries. The extracts inhibited 
all the tested strains, MICs ranging from 0.4 mg/mL (for Stella Blue extract
against UTI P. aeruginosa) to 9.5 mg/mL (for all extracts against UTI K.
pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae). This is the first study that assessed in vitro the
antibacterial activity of blueberries against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia 
stuartii and Micrococcus spp. strains isolated from UTI.
