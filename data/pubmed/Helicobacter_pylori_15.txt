We report a rare case of undifferentiated-type intramucosal gastric cancer that
occurred in the fornix of the stomach without Helicobacter pylori infection,
which consisted mainly of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. A 49-year-old man
visited our hospital for a follow-up endoscopic examination of a small depressed 
lesion of the gastric fornix detected by surveillance esophagogastroduodenoscopy.
On magnifying endoscopy with blue laser imaging, the depressed lesion
(approximately 10 mm in diameter) was regarded as undifferentiated-type early
gastric cancer that proved to be a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma by
histological examination of biopsied specimens. The cancerous lesion was
successfully treated with endoscopic submucosal dissection and microscopically
showed an intramucosal cancer that invaded the whole mucosal layer with
predominant growth of a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma component. The
patient status was verified as Helicobacter pylori-naïve according to the strict 
diagnostic criteria, thereby confirming this case as an undifferentiated-type
Helicobacter pylori-uninfected gastric cancer. Helicobacter pylori-uninfected
intramucosal poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma occurring in the gastric fornix
has not been previously reported.
