We assessed the causes of polyserositis in pigs, categorized by causative agents 
and ages of animals affected. In a 3-y study, 246 pigs from 80 different farms
with recurrent problems of polyserositis, in a high-density breeding area, were
submitted for autopsy; 154 pigs with typical fibrinous serosal lesions were
sampled for further bacterial and viral investigation. The most common gross
lesions were pleuritis and pericarditis (141 of 154; 92%). The animals most
affected were weaned pigs (139 of 154; 90%). Haemophilus parasuis and Mycoplasma 
hyorhinis were the most common bacteria detected and were present at the same
rate (85 of 154; 55%). Other bacteria isolated were Streptococcus sp. (44 of 154;
29%), Pasteurella multocida (21 of 154; 14%), Escherichia coli (19 of 154; 12%), 
Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (7 of 154; 5%), and Trueperella pyogenes (4 of
154; 3%). Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV; 119 of 154;
77%) predominated among the viruses detected, followed, with lesser prevalence,
by porcine circovirus 2 (40 of 154; 26%) and swine influenza A virus (19 of 154; 
12%). Bacterial coinfection and coinfection of bacteria and viruses were common
(128 of 154; 83%). A strong positive correlation was found between coinfection by
H. parasuis and M. hyorhinis and also by H. parasuis with PRRSV.
