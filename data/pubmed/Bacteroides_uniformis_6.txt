Breast cancer is a hormonally-driven cancer, and various dietary factors are
associated with estrogen metabolism, including dietary fiber. Several studies
report associations between dietary fiber and breast cancer; however, research on
whether fiber influences circulating estrogens through the gut microbiota is
rare. The objective of this cross-sectional study among 29 newly-diagnosed (stage
0-II), post-menopausal breast cancer patients is to examine associations between 
dietary fiber and the gut microbiota that are linked with β-glucuronidase
activity, and purportedly increase circulating estrogens. Spearman's and partial 
correlations controlling for body mass index and age were performed using dietary
recall data, Illumina MiSeq generated microbiota relative abundance, and
HPLC-mass spectrometry-derived estradiol and estrone levels.Major findings are:
(1) total dietary fiber is inversely associated with Clostridium hathewayi (r=
-0.419; p = 0.024); (2) soluble fiber is inversely associated with Clostridium
(r=-0.11; p = 0.02); (3) insoluble fiber is positively associated with
Bacteroides uniformis sp. (r = 0.382; p = 0.041); and (4) serum estradiol and
estrone levels are not correlated with species/genera or dietary fiber, though
there is a trend toward an inverse association between soluble fiber and
estradiol levels (r= -0.30; p = 0.12). More studies are needed to understand the 
complex interaction between dietary fiber, intestinal microbiota, and hormonal
levels in older females.
