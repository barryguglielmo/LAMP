BACKGROUNDS AND AIMS: Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), including Ulcerative
Colitis (UC), coincide with alterations in the gut microbiota. Consumption of
immunomodulatory strains of probiotic bacteria may induce or prolong remission in
UC patients. Fermented foods, including cheeses, constitute major vectors for
bacteria consumption. New evidences revealed anti-inflammatory effects in
selected strains of Propionibacterium freudenreichii. We thus hypothesized that
consumption of a functional cheese, fermented by such a strain, may exert a
positive effect on IBD.
METHODS: We investigated the impact of cheese fermented by P. freudenreichii on
gut inflammation. We developed an experimental single-strain cheese solely
fermented by a selected immunomodulatory strain of P. freudenreichii, CIRM-BIA
129. We moreover produced, in industrial conditions, an Emmental cheese using the
same strain, in combination with Lactobacillus delbrueckii CNRZ327 and
Streptococcus thermophilus LMD-9, as starters. Consumption of both cheeses was
investigated with respect to prevention of Dextran Sodium Sulphate (DSS)-induced 
colitis in mice.
RESULTS: Consumption of the single-strain experimental cheese, or of the
industrial Emmental, both fermented by P. freudenreichii CIRM-BIA 129, reduced
severity of subsequent DSS-induced colitis, weight loss, disease activity index
and histological score. Both treatments, in a preventive way, reduced small bowel
Immunoglobulin A (IgA) secretion, restored occludin gene expression and prevented
induction of Tumor Necrosis Factor α (TNFα), Interferon γ (IFNγ) and
Interleukin-17 (IL-17).
CONCLUSIONS: A combination of immunomodulatory strains of starter bacteria can be
used to manufacture an anti-inflammatory cheese, as revealed in an animal model
of colitis. This opens new perspectives for personalised nutrition in the context
of IBD.
