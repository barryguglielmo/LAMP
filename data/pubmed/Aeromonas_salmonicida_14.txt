Microorganisms play important roles in the degradation of volatile organic
compounds. Aeromonas salmonicida strain (AEP-3) generated from biomass in the
citric acid fermentation industry was screened and subjected to denaturing
gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting and 16S rDNA gene sequencing. 
The growth conditions of AEP-3 in Luria-Bertani broth were optimized at 25 °C and
approximately pH 7. AEP-3 was used to degrade ethyl formate, propionic aldehyde, 
or acetone alone and their mixture. The concentrations of ethyl formate,
propionic aldehyde, and acetone were below 7500, 600, and 800 mg L-1,
respectively, and their maximum degradation efficiencies were 100%, 92.41%, and
34.75%. AEP-3 first degraded acetone and propionic aldehyde in the mixture,
followed by ethyl formate. The degradation pathways of these organic compounds in
the mixture and their substrate interactions during degradation were explored.
Propionic aldehyde was first converted into propionic acid in the metabolic
process and was involved in the subsequent carboxylic acid cycle. By contrast,
ethyl formate was first hydrolyzed into formic acid and ethanol. Then, formic
acid participated in the cyclic metabolism of carboxylic acid, whereas, ethanol
was hydrolyzed into acetaldehyde and acetic acid through alcohol and aldehyde
dehydrogenase. Additionally, acetone directly interacted with nitrate in the
medium under the action of hydrogen ions and produced carbon dioxide, water, and 
nitrogen. Overall, this study provides a new degrading bacterium biodegradability
toward the exhaust gas of citric acid fermentation.
