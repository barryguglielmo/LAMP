BACKGROUND: Colistin has become a last-resort antibiotic for the management of
multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria. The disk diffusion test is cheap and 
easy to perform but may be unreliable for colistin susceptibility testing due to 
poor diffusion of the large colistin molecule. An improved agar diffusion test
would increase the reliability of colistin susceptibility testing. This study
aimed to modify Muller-Hinton agar (MHA) to improve colistin diffusion in agar.
METHODS: MHA was modified by reducing the agar concentration from 100% to 30% and
supplementing with protamine. We tested 60 gram-negative clinical isolates of
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (N=27) and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex
(N=33). Disk diffusion test results were interpreted based on minimum inhibitory 
concentrations determined by broth microdilution.
RESULTS: The modified MHA yielded the best performance metrics, including 94.7%
sensitivity, 100% specificity, and an area under the curve of 0.995 (95%
confidence interval, 0.982-1.000), P<0.001, at a cut-off point of 13 mm.
CONCLUSIONS: A reduction of the agar concentration from 100% to 30% and the
addition of protamine improved colistin diffusion in agar and allowed routine
colistin susceptibility testing in a clinical microbiology laboratory, but should
be handled with caution.
