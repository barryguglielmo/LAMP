The inhibitory and bactericidal activities of thyme oil against the foodborne
multiple antibiotics-resistant Enterococcus faecalis biofilm were evaluated in
this study. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that more than 70% of
the composition of thyme oil is thymol. Crystal violet staining assay showed that
128 and 256 μg/mL thyme oil significantly inhibited the biofilm formation of E.
faecalis. The cell adherence of E. faecalis, as shown by its swimming and
swarming motilities, was reduced by thyme oil. The exopolysaccharide (EPS)
quantification assay showed that thyme oil inhibited the EPS synthesis in E.
faecalis biofilms. The 3D-view observations through confocal laser scanning and
scanning electron microscopy suggested that cell adherence and biofilm thickness 
were decreased in thyme oil-treated biofilms. Quantitative real-time analyses
showed that the transcription of ebp and epa gene clusters, which were related to
cell mobility and EPS production, was inhibited by thyme oil. Thus, thyme oil
effectively inhibited the biofilm formation of E. faecalis by affecting cell
adherence and EPS synthesis. Furthermore, 2,048 and 4,096 μg/mL thyme oil can
effectively inactivate E. faecalis population in the mature E. faecalis biofilms 
by 5.75 and 7.20 log CFU/mL, respectively, after 30 min of treatment. Thus, thyme
oil at different concentrations can be used as an effective antibiofilm or
germicidal agent to control E. faecalis biofilms.
