Food-producing animals are considered a leading source of human Salmonella
infections in Korea. However, there is a lack of comprehensive and up-to-date
data regarding the diversity and resistance profiles of Salmonella serotypes in
these animals. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the distribution and
antimicrobial resistance profiles of Salmonella serotypes isolated from cattle,
pigs, and chickens in Korea between 2010 and 2018. A total of 3018 Salmonella
isolates were obtained from 16 laboratories/centers participating in the Korean
Veterinary Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System. Salmonella serotypes were 
identified from the following isolates: 179 cattle (17 serotypes), 959 pig (45
serotypes), and 1880 chicken (64 serotypes). The most frequent serotypes in
cattle (Typhimurium, Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:-, and Schwarzengrund), pigs
(Typhimurium, Rissen, and S. 4,[5],12:i:-), and chickens (Enteritidis, Albany,
Virchow, and Montevideo) accounted for more than 50% of the total serotypes in
the respective animal species. To the best of our knowledge, Salmonella
4,[5],12:i:- has not been identified in cattle in Korea to date. More than 80% of
the isolates demonstrated resistance to at least one antimicrobial agent.
Multidrug-resistance was found in almost half of the serotypes; the highest
proportion in cattle (59.2%), followed by pigs (53.4%), and chickens (45.7%).
Significant proportions of the serotypes were resistant to ampicillin,
streptomycin, and tetracycline. Ceftiofur and ciprofloxacin resistance rates were
the highest in Salmonella isolated from chickens (17.1% and 4.1%, respectively)
and cattle (10.1% and 3.9%, respectively) compared to that in pigs. Among the
frequent serotypes, Albany demonstrated the highest resistance rate (>90%) to
five different antimicrobials. Alarmingly, some Salmonella serotypes that are
frequently associated with human infections demonstrated a trend of increasing
resistance to critically important antibiotics, including 3rd generation
cephalosporins and quinolones. Collectively, the presence of antibiotic-resistant
Salmonella in food-producing animals poses a potential risk to public health.
