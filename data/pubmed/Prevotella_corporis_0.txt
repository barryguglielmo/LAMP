A strain of an obligately anaerobic, Gram-stain-negative rod-shaped bacterium is 
described by phenotypical, biochemical and genotypical characterization. Strain
A2672T was isolated from a wound of a patient sampled during routine care at
hospital. Phylogenetic analysis was based on full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence
analysis and revealed the strain to belong to the genus Prevotella, but to be
distant from known species, with the closest relationship to Prevotella corporis.
The genomic DNA G+C content was 44.0 mol%. Strain A2672T was moderately
saccharolytic and proteolytic. The most abundant cellular long-chain fatty acids 
were anteiso-C15 : 0 and iso-C15 : 0. In view of these characteristics as well as
whole-genome sequence analysis, strain A2672T is considered to represent a novel 
species within the genus Prevotella, for which the name Prevotella brunnea sp.
nov. is proposed. The type strain is A2672T (=DSM 108033T=CCOS 1231T=CCUG
72809T).
