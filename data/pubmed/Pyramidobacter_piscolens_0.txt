Microbial contributions to periodontal disease have been under renewed scrutiny
with the advent of newer technologies to identify their presence and gene
expression at the molecular level. Members of the phylum Synergistetes are some
of the more recent bacteria to be associated with periodontal disease. Bacteria
classified in this phylum can be found in a wide variety of habitats including
both inside and outside of a mammalian host. Members of this phylum have been
identified as part of the human microbiome. Indeed, many of the identified
phylotypes have yet to be cultivated. Here we consider contributions of three
named and formally described species to the oral microbial community and to
pathogenesis of periodontal disease.
