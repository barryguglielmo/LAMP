Staphylococcus pasteuri is a gram-positive organism found in food products as
well as naturally occurring in air and on surfaces. We present the first known
case of Staphylococcus pasteuri osteomyelitis caused by machine injection injury.
The patient was treated with emergent surgical debridement as well as doxycycline
for a soft tissue infection. Despite targeted therapy, the infection progressed
to osteomyelitis and was treated successfully with additional surgical
debridement and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. There is sparse information on
both infections and treatment of Staphylococcus pasteuri. We present our case
report as well as a review of the literature on the epidemiology, susceptibility 
and treatment recommendations for Staphylococcus pasteuri infections.
