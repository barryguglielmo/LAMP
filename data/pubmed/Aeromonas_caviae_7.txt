The study provides data on antibiotic resistance as well as the virulence
characteristics of Aeromonas caviae isolated from raw and treated wastewater. The
isolates were identified as A. caviae by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In the
analyzed strains, high frequency for the following genes was observed:
aac(6')-Ib-cr, qnrB, and qnrD. The presence of qnrA and ogxB genes was not found 
in any strain. The higher frequency of the investigated genes was observed in
strains from raw wastewater (RW). The strains of A. caviae showed multiple
antibiotic resistance evaluated by the disk diffusion method. Multiple antibiotic
resistance indices ranged from 0.36 to 0.69. Susceptibility to six heavy metals
(Cd+2, Zn+2, Cu+2, Co+2, Mn+2, and Ni+2) was recorded for all the isolates. The
order of metal resistance of A. caviae was Co > Cu > Zn > Cd > Ni > Mn. All the
strains of A. caviae showed β-hemolytic activity. Enzymes of amylase, cellulase, 
and lipase were produced by all isolates. Only the strains from RW had the
ability to form biofilms and showed motility. The obtained results indicate that 
wastewater is a potential source and/or reservoir of virulent and
multidrug-resistant A. caviae as "high-risk isolates."
