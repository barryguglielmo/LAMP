Tetanus is a neurologic disease of humans and animals characterized by spastic
paralysis. Tetanus is caused by tetanus toxin (TeNT) produced by Clostridium
tetani, an environmental soilborne, gram-positive, sporulating bacterium. The
disease most often results from wound contamination by soil containing C. tetani 
spores. Horses, sheep, and humans are highly sensitive to TeNT, whereas cattle,
dogs, and cats are more resistant. The diagnosis of tetanus is mainly based on
the characteristic clinical signs. Identification of C. tetani at the wound site 
is often difficult.
