Neonatal calf diarrhoea is one of the challenges faced by intensive farming, and 
probiotics are considered a promising approach to improve calves' health. The
objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of potential probiotic
lactobacilli on new-born dairy calves' growth, diarrhoea incidence, faecal score,
cytokine expression in blood cells, immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels in plasma and
faeces, and pathogen abundance in faeces. Two in vivo assays were conducted at
the same farm in two annual calving seasons. Treated calves received one daily
dose of the selected lactobacilli (Lactobacillus reuteri TP1.3B or Lactobacillus 
johnsonii TP1.6) for 10 consecutive days. A faecal score was recorded daily,
average daily gain (ADG) was calculated, and blood and faeces samples were
collected. Pathogen abundance was analysed by absolute qPCR in faeces using
primers directed at Salmonella enterica, rotavirus, coronavirus, Cryptosporidium 
parvum and three Escherichia coli virulence genes (eae, clpG and Stx1). The
faecal score was positively affected by the administration of both lactobacilli
strains, and diarrhoea incidence was significantly lower in treated calves. No
differences were found regarding ADG, cytokine expression, IgA levels and
pathogen abundance. Our findings showed that oral administration of these strains
could improve gastrointestinal health, but results could vary depending on the
calving season, which may be related to pathogen seasonality and other
environmental effects.
