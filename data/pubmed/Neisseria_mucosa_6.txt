The present study aims to examine the effects of three different high-fat diet
(HFD) on mice gut microbiota in order to analyse whether they create the
microenvironmental conditions that either promote or prevent colorectal cancer
(CRC). We evaluated colonic mucosa-associated microbiota in CD1 mice fed with
HFD, based on 60% kcal from fat-containing coconut, sunflower or extra-virgin
olive oil as the only source of fat. The main findings were as follows: (a) All
HFD produced a decrease in the richness and diversity of the intestinal
microbiota that was independent of mouse weight, (b) HFD switched Lactobacillus
to Lactococcus. In general, the results showed that both sunflower- and
coconut-HFD generated a pro-inflammatory intestinal microenvironment. In brief,
coconut-HFD decreased Akkermansia and increased Staphylococcus, Prevotella and
Bacteroides spp. abundance. Sunflower-HFD reduced Akkermansia and
Bifidobacterium, while enhancing Sphingomonas and Neisseria spp. abundance. In
contrast, EVOO-HFD produced an anti-inflammatory microenvironment characterised
by a decreased Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Neisseria and Pseudomonas spp.
abundance. At the same time, it increased the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and 
maintained the Akkermansia population. To conclude, EVOO-HFD produced changes in 
the gut microbiota that are associated with the prevention of CRC, while coconut 
and sunflower-HFD caused changes associated with an increased risk of CRC.
