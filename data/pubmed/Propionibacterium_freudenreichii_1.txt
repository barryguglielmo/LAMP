During the past years, there has been a growing interest in the bioproduction of 
propionic acid by Propionibacterium. One of the major limitations of the existing
models lies in their low productivity yield. Hence, many strategies have been
proposed in order to circumvent this obstacle. This article provides a
comprehensive synthesis and review of important biotechnological aspects of
propionic acid production as a common ingredient in food and biotechnology
industries. We first discuss some of the most important production processes,
mainly focusing on biological production. Then, we provide a summary of important
propionic acid producers, including Propionibacterium freudenreichii and
Propionibacterium acidipropionici, as well as a wide range of reported
growth/production media. Furthermore, we describe bioprocess variables that can
have impact on the production yield. Finally, we propose methods for the
extraction and analysis of propionic acid and put forward strategies for
overcoming the limitations of competitive microbial production from the
economical point of view. Several factors influence the propionic acid
concentration and productivity such as culture conditions, type and bioreactor
scale; however, the pH value and temperature are the most important ones. Given
that there are many reports about propionic acid production from glucose, whey
permeate, glycerol, lactic acid, hemicelluloses, hydrolyzed corn meal, lactose,
sugarcane molasses and enzymatically hydrolyzed whole wheat flour, only few
review articles evaluate biotechnological aspects, i.e. bioprocess variables.
