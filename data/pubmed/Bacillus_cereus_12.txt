The extensive and intensive utilization of glyphosate (Glyp) caused public
concerns on the potential risk of environment and health resulted from the
chemical residues. Therefore, the development of a high-selective, low-cost and
easy-operation Glyp detection methods is highly desired. Screening highly
selective enzymes by directed evolution is important in practical applications.
Herein, a glyphosate oxidase (GlypO) preferring substrate Glyp to produce H2O2
was obtained via directed evolution from glycine oxidase obtained from Bacillus
cereus (BceGO). The catalytic efficiency, specificity constant, and affinity
enhancement factor of GlypO toward Glyp were increased by 2.85 × 103-fold;
2.25 × 105-fold; and 9.64 × 104-fold, respectively, compared with those of BceGO.
The catalytic efficiency toward glycine decreased by 78.60-fold. The spores of
Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) effectively catalyzed luminol-H2O2 reaction to
create excellent chemiluminescence (CL) signal because CotA-laccase exists on
their surface. Based on these findings, a new CL biosensor via coupling to
biological reaction system was presented for Glyp detection. The CL biosensor
exhibited several advantages, such as eco-friendliness, low cost, high
selectivity and sensitivity, and good practical application prospects for
environmental pollution control.
