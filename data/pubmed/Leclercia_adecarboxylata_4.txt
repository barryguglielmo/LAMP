Leclercia adecarboxylata is a gram-negative bacillus of the Enterobacteriaceae
family. It is a rare human pathogen that is often acquired via wound and/or
contact with aquatic environment. Although multiple cases of L. adecarboxylata
infections are described in the adult population, few have been documented in
pediatrics. We will present two cases of L. adecarboxylata infections in the
pediatric population. The first is a case of cellulitis in an 11-year-old male
patient after a penetrating wound. The second is a first-documented urinary tract
infection in a 16-year-old male patient with chronic kidney disease. Both
patients were successfully treated with antibiotics and surgical intervention, if
necessary. These cases highlight the growing emergence of this bacterium in the
pediatric population and the need to become more aware of its threat even in
patients who are immunocompetent.
