The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of 3 vaccine
formulations containing proteins (FimH, leukotoxin, and pyolysin), inactivated
whole cells (Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium necrophorum, and Trueperella
pyogenes), or both, in the prevention of postpartum uterine diseases. A
randomized clinical trial was conducted at a commercial dairy farm; 800 heifers
were assigned into 1 of 4 different treatment groups: control, vaccine 1
(bacterin and subunit proteins), vaccine 2 (bacterin), and vaccine 3 (recombinant
subunit proteins), and each heifer received a subcutaneous injection of its
respective treatment at 240 ± 3 and 270 ± 3 d of gestation. Vaccination
significantly reduced the incidence of puerperal metritis when compared with
control (9.1% vs. 14.9%, respectively; odds ratio 0.51). Additionally, vaccine 3 
was found to reduce the incidence of puerperal metritis when compared with the
control (8.0% vs. 14.9%, respectively; odds ratio 0.46). Reproduction was
improved for metritic cows that were vaccinated, and the effect was stronger for 
cows that were treated with vaccine 3. In general, vaccination decreased the
total vaginal bacterial load and decreased the vaginal load of F. necrophorum by 
9 d in milk. Vaccination reduced the prevalence of puerperal metritis in the
first lactation of dairy cows, leading to less metritic disease and improved
reproduction.
