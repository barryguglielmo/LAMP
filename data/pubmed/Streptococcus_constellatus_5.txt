BACKGROUND: Surgery for failed homograft aortic root replacement with extensive
calcification in the setting of endocarditis alone is very challenging.
CASE SUMMARY: We report the case of redo aortic valve replacement and mitral
valve replacement, in a 39 years old presenting with a rare Streptococcus
constellatus endocarditis of a previously implanted homograft root and native
mitral valve, where conventional valve replacement proved nonfeasible. S.
constellatus had caused severe tissue destruction and the extensive calcification
in the homograft prevented conventional valve replacement with sutures. In this
case, a sutureless valve provided a useful alternative surgical strategy.
DISCUSSION: We consider heavily calcified failed homografts to be a good
indication for sutureless (rapid deployment) valves.
