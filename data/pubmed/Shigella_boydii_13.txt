BACKGROUND: Diarrhea, particularly of enteric bacterial pathogen, remains a major
cause of morbidity and mortality in Ethiopia. Despite the high prevalence of
diarrheal disease among under-five children, antibiotic resistance of bacterial
pathogens test is not part of routine childcare in the study area. This study
aimed to investigate the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility status of
Salmonella and Shigella species among diarrheic children attending public health 
institutions in Ambo town, west Showa, Ethiopia.
METHODS: Institutional based, cross-sectional study was carried out from January 
to July 2014 among 239 diarrheic children below five years of age in Ambo town,
Ethiopia. Information about patient demographics, signs, and symptoms was
obtained from the parents/guardians of each child using a questionnaire. Stool
samples from diarrheic children were collected and processed for isolation of
Salmonella and Shigella using conventional microbiology procedures. Suspected
Salmonella isolates were confirmed by genus-specific PCR and serotyped using a
slide agglutination test. Susceptibility to 10 commonly used antimicrobials was
assessed using the Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method.
RESULTS: From the 239 children screened, only nine (3.8%) of them were positive
for either Salmonella (n = 3) or Shigella (n = 6) and 19 (7.9%) positive for the 
intestinal parasite. Three species of Shigella were identified: Shigella
flexinari (n = 3), Shigella boydii (n = 2), and Shigella sonnei (n = 1). The
three Salmonella isolates were S. chicago, S. caracas, and S. saintpaul.
Salmonella and Shigella isolates were resistant to ampicillin (88.9%), followed
by tetracycline (66.7%), cotrimoxazole (55.6%), chloramphenicol (44.4%),
amoxicillin (33.3%), nalidixic acid (11.1%) and cefotaxime (11.1%). All isolates 
were sensitive to amikacin, ciprofloxacin, and gentamycin.
CONCLUSION: In this study, either Salmonella or Shigella species were detected
only in 3.8% of diarrheic children in Ambo town, suggesting the dominance of
other causes of diarrhea in the study area. A further study targeting other
causes of diarrhea should be conducted to establish the major causes of childhood
diarrhea in the study area.
