AIM: This paper was mainly aimed at synthesis of Ce-containing nano-Mg-phosphate 
ceramic as a multifunctional material.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two ceramics based on Mg3(PO4)2 and Ce0.2Mg2.8(PO4)2
formulas (MP and MP-C, respectively) were synthesized. The synthesized powders
were characterized by XRD, TEM, Zeta potential, and FTIR. Also, their dissolution
behavior was tested in Tris-HCl buffer solution. Moreover, the antimicrobial
efficacy was evaluated against gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus sphaericus MTCC
511 &Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 87) and gram-negative bacteria (Enterobacter
aerogenes MTCC 111 &Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 1034) using dick diffusion assay 
and microdilution method. Furthermore, the cell viability test was performed for 
the ceramics on Vero cells (African green monkey kidney cells), and their
antitumor activity was determined by PC3 cell line (prostatic cancer). Also, the 
cellular uptake was determined by the flow cytometry.
KEY FINDINGS: The results showed that the substitution of Mg by Ce decreased the 
particle size from 40 to 90 nm for MP sample to 2-10 nm for MP-C sample and
increased the degradation rate. Both samples showed excellent antimicrobial
activities. Moreover, MP demonstrated more cell viability than MP-C on Vero cells
at high concentrations, whereas, MP-C showed more antitumor activity on PC3 cells
than MP sample. Moreover, MP-C showed a higher cell uptake than MP due to its
smaller size and more negative charge.
SIGNIFICANCE: Mg-phosphate ceramic can be used in this study successfully as a
delivery system for cerium ions and showed a high antitumor activity, which makes
it highly recommended as safe and effective cancer treatment materials.
