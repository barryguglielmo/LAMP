Diacron-reactive oxygen metabolite (d-ROM) and biological antioxidant potential
(BAP) levels in the serum of horses were measured (ponies, n = 15; thoroughbred, 
n = 31; other full-sized horses, n = 7). The mean d-ROM levels in horses were
significantly higher (p < 0.001) than those in dairy cattle (n = 25) and dogs (n 
= 31). However, d-ROM levels in horses were lower than the standard levels
reported in humans. When d-ROM and BAP levels were plotted graphically, the
points for horses with a disease (ringbone in 1 Japanese sports horse, cellulitis
in 1 thoroughbred, melanoma in 1 Lipizzaner) fell outside the group of points for
other (non-diseased) horses. A similar separation was seen (using data from other
authors) for a horse with Rhodococcus equi, a horse following castration surgery,
and a mare following delivery. These results, comparing horses, other animals,
and humans, are interesting from the standpoint of comparative medicine, and they
contribute to the sparse literature available on d-ROM and BAP levels in animals.
Because the level of d-ROM and BAP levels were changed depending on the situation
of health, those indexes are promising as indices of health in horses.
