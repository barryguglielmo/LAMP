Keratinase is capable of distinctive degradation of keratin, which provides an
eco-friendly approach for keratin waste management towards sustainable
development. In this study, the recombinant keratinase (KERBP) from Brevibacillus
parabrevis was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified KERBP had
the specific activity of 6005.3 U/mg. It showed remarkable tolerance to various
surfactants and also no collagenolytic activity. However, the moderate thermal
stability limited its further application. Thus, protein engineering was further 
adopted to improve its stability. The variants of T218S, S236C and N181D were
constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and combinatorial mutagenesis. Compared 
with the wild type, the t1/2 at 60 °C for the variants T218S, S236C and N181D
were 3.05-, 1.18- and 1-fold increase, respectively. Moreover, the double
variants N181D-T218S and N181D-S236C significantly improved thermostability with 
5.1 and 2.9 °C increase of T50, and prolonging t1/2 at 60 °C with 4.09 and
1.54-fold, respectively. And the catalytic efficiency of the T218S and
N181D-T218S variants was also significantly improved. Furthermore, the keratinase
displayed favorable ability to dehair wool from skin within 7 h, which showed
potential in leather dehairing. Our work contributes to a further insight into
the thermostability of keratinase and offers a promising alternative for
industrial leather application.
