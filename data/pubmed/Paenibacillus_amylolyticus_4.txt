The checkerboard method was used to study the potential interactions between
eight essential oils (Basil, Cinnamon, Eucalyptus, Mandarin, Oregano, Peppermint,
Tea tree, and Thyme) when used as antibacterial agents against Bacillus cereus
LSPQ 2872 and Paenibacillus amylolyticus ATCC 9995. The minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) of each essential oil (EO) and the fractional inhibitory
concentration (FIC) index for the binary combinations of essential oils (EOs)
were determined. According to FIC index values, some of the compound binary
combinations showed an additive effect; however, Thyme/Tea tree and
Cinnamon/Thyme EOs exhibited a synergistic effect against P. amylolyticus and B. 
cereus, respectively. Cinnamon/Thyme EOs mixture exhibited no interactive effect 
against P. amylolyticus, but a synergistic effect against B. cereus. The
combination of Oregano/Thyme EOs displayed the best antibacterial activity and
showed a synergistic effect against B. cereus and P. amylolyticus bacteria. The
Oregano/Thyme EOs mixture has potential application in food preservation to
reduce the contamination of B. cereus and P. amylolyticus.
