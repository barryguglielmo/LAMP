OBJECTIVES: Achromobacter xylosoxidans is an emerging pathogen in cystic fibrosis
(CF). Relatively little is known about its clinical impact and optimal
management. In the present study, the in vitro bactericidal activities of
meropenem, either alone or in combination with colistin, levofloxacin, or
chloramphenicol, were assessed using A. xylosoxidans strains isolated from CF
patients. The synergistic interactions of these combinations were also
investigated.
METHODS: Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by microbroth
dilution. Bactericidal and synergistic effects of the tested antibiotic
combinations were assessed by using the time-kill curve technique.
RESULTS: Based on the time-kill curves, we found that meropenem-colistin
combinations have bactericidal and synergistic activities for 24 h against A.
xylosoxidans strains, both at 1 × MIC and 4 × MIC. Although synergistic
interactions were seen with meropenem-levofloxacin combinations, no bactericidal 
interactions were observed. Additionally, the meropenem-chloramphenicol
combinations were found to be neither bactericidal nor synergistic. No antagonism
was observed with any combination tested.
CONCLUSIONS: This study's findings could have important implications for
empirical or combination antimicrobial therapy with tested antibiotics.
