BACKGROUND: Altered microbiome composition and aberrant promoter hypermethylation
of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) are two important hallmarks of colorectal cancer
(CRC). Here we performed concurrent 16S rRNA gene sequencing and methyl-CpG
binding domain-based capture sequencing in 33 tissue biopsies (5 normal colonic
mucosa tissues, 4 pairs of adenoma and adenoma-adjacent tissues, and 10 pairs of 
CRC and CRC-adjacent tissues) to identify significant associations between TSG
promoter hypermethylation and CRC-associated bacteria, followed by functional
validation of the methylation-associated bacteria.
RESULTS: Fusobacterium nucleatum and Hungatella hathewayi were identified as the 
top two methylation-regulating bacteria. Targeted analysis on bona fide TSGs
revealed that H. hathewayi and Streptococcus spp. significantly correlated with
CDX2 and MLH1 promoter hypermethylation, respectively. Mechanistic validation
with cell-line and animal models revealed that F. nucleatum and H. hathewayi
upregulated DNA methyltransferase. H. hathewayi inoculation also promoted colonic
epithelial cell proliferation in germ-free and conventional mice.
CONCLUSION: Our integrative analysis revealed previously unknown epigenetic
regulation of TSGs in host cells through inducing DNA methyltransferase by F.
nucleatum and H. hathewayi, and established the latter as CRC-promoting bacteria.
