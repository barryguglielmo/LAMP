The cellulosome is a supramolecular multienzymatic protein complex that functions
as a biological nanomachine of cellulosic biomass degradation. How the
megadalton-size cellulosome adapts to a solid substrate is central to its
mechanism of action and is also key for its efficient use in bioconversion
applications. We report time-lapse visualization of crystalline cellulose
degradation by individual cellulosomes from Clostridium thermocellum by atomic
force microscopy. Upon binding to cellulose, the cellulosomes switch to
elongated, even filamentous shapes and morph these dynamically at below 1 min
time scale according to requirements of the substrate surface under attack.
Compared with noncomplexed cellulases that peel off material while sliding along 
crystalline cellulose surfaces, the cellulosomes remain bound locally for minutes
and remove the material lying underneath. The consequent roughening up of the
surface leads to an efficient deconstruction of cellulose nanocrystals both from 
the ends and through fissions within. Distinct modes of cellulose nanocrystal
deconstruction by nature's major cellulase systems are thus revealed.
