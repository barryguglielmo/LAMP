PURPOSE: Different characteristics of airway microbiome in asthmatics may lead to
differential immune responses, which in turn cause eosinophilic or neutrophilic
airway inflammation. However, the relationships among these factors have yet to
be fully elucidated.
METHODS: Microbes in induced sputum samples were subjected to sequence analysis
of 16S rRNA. Airway inflammatory phenotypes were defined as neutrophils (>60%)
and eosinophils (>3%), and inflammation endotypes were defined by levels of T
helper (Th) 1 (interferon-γ), Th2 (interleukin [IL]-5 and IL-13), Th-17 (IL-17), 
and innate Th2 (IL-25, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin) cytokines,
inflammasomes (IL-1β), epithelial activation markers (granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor and IL-8), and Inflammation (IL-6 and tumor necrosis
factor-α) cytokines in sputum supernatants was assessed by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: The numbers of operational taxonomic units were significantly higher in 
the mixed (n = 21) and neutrophilic (n = 23) inflammation groups than in the
paucigranulocytic inflammation group (n = 19; p < 0.05). At the species level,
Granulicatella adiacens, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus pneumoniae,
Veillonella rogosae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and Neisseria perflava levels
were significantly higher in the eosinophilic inflammation group (n = 20),
whereas JYGU_s levels were significantly higher in the neutrophilic inflammation 
group compared to the other subtypes (p < 0.05). Additionally, IL-5 and IL-13
concentrations were correlated with the percentage of eosinophils (p < 0.05) and 
IL-13 levels were positively correlated with the read counts of Porphyromonas
pasteri and V. rogosae (p < 0.05). IL-1β concentrations were correlated with the 
percentage of neutrophils (p < 0.05). had a tendency to be positively correlated 
with the read count of JYGU_s (p = 0.095), and was negatively correlated with
that of S. pneumoniae (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Difference of microbial patterns in airways may induce distinctive
endotypes of asthma, which is responsible for the neutrophilic or eosinophilic
inflammation in asthma.
