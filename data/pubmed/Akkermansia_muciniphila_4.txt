Abiraterone acetate (AA) is an inhibitor of androgen biosynthesis, though this
cannot fully explain its efficacy against androgen-independent prostate cancer.
Here, we demonstrate that androgen deprivation therapy depletes
androgen-utilizing Corynebacterium spp. in prostate cancer patients and that oral
AA further enriches for the health-associated commensal, Akkermansia muciniphila.
Functional inferencing elucidates a coinciding increase in bacterial biosynthesis
of vitamin K2 (an inhibitor of androgen dependent and independent tumor growth). 
These results are highly reproducible in a host-free gut model, excluding the
possibility of immune involvement. Further investigation reveals that AA is
metabolized by bacteria in vitro and that breakdown components selectively impact
growth. We conclude that A. muciniphila is a key regulator of AA-mediated
restructuring of microbial communities, and that this species may affect
treatment response in castrate-resistant cohorts. Ongoing initiatives aimed at
modulating the colonic microbiota of cancer patients may consider targeted
delivery of poorly absorbed selective bacterial growth agents.
