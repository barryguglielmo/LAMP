This study investigated the effects of Lactobacillus hilgardii (LH), alone or in 
combination with Lactobacillus plantarum (LP), on the aerobic stability,
fermentation quality and dynamics of the bacterial and fungal communities of
sugarcane top silage. Results demonstrated that LH and LHLP (LH combined with LP)
improved the aerobic stability of sugarcane top silages. As the exposure time
increased, the pH values and the contents of lactic acid, acetic acid, as well as
propionic acid remained stable in silage treated with LH and LHLP. The abundance 
of L. hilgardii was enriched and the undesirable microorganisms, such as
Acetobacter pasteurianus, Paenibacillus amylolyticus and yeasts like Kazachstania
humilis, were suppressed in silages treated with LH and LHLP. In conclusion,
LH-treated silage, whether with LP or not, positively impacted the fungal and
bacterial microbes. This improved the quality of fermentation, the aerobic
stability, and reduced aerobic spoilage in sugarcane top silage.
