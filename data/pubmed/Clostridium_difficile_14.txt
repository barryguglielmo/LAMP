With rates of community-associated Clostridium difficile infection (CA-CDI)
increasing worldwide, potential reservoirs/sources of C. difficile in the
community are being sought. Since C. difficile is found in animal manure and
human biosolids which are composted for agricultural purposes, composted products
could be a source. In this study, the presence of C. difficile in composted
products, and their genetic relatedness to other previously isolated strains from
humans, root vegetables and the environment in Western Australia, was
investigated. Overall, C. difficile was found in 22.5% (16/71) of composted
products [29.7% (11/37) of soil conditioners, 16.7% (2/12) of mulches and 13.6%
(3/22) of garden mixes]. Fifteen C. difficile PCR ribotypes (RTs) were
identified, the most common toxigenic strains being RTs 020 and 056. C. difficile
RT 056 is commonly associated with CDI in humans and has also been isolated from 
cattle, root vegetables and the environment (veterinary clinics and lawn) in
Australia. High-resolution core-genome analysis of 29 C. difficile RT 056 strains
revealed clonal relationships between isolates derived from humans, vegetables,
composted products and the environment. These findings provide support for an
intricate transmission network between human, food and the environment, further
highlighting the importance of a "One Health" approach for managing CDI. This
