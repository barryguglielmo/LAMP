The use of mass antimicrobial treatment has been linked to the emergence of
antimicrobial resistance in human and animal pathogens. Using whole-genome
single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing, we characterized genomic variability
of multidrug-resistant Rhodococcus equi isolated from soil samples from 100 farms
endemic for R. equi infections in Kentucky. We discovered the novel
erm(51)-encoding resistance to MLSB in R. equi isolates from soil of
horse-breeding farms. Erm(51) is inserted in a transposon (TnErm51) that is
associated with a putative conjugative plasmid (pRErm51), a mobilizable plasmid
(pMobErm51), or both enabling horizontal gene transfer to susceptible organisms
and conferring high levels of resistance against MLSB in vitro. This new
resistant genotype also carries a previously unidentified rpoB mutation
conferring resistance to rifampicin. Isolates carrying both vapA and erm(51) were
rarely found, indicating either a recent acquisition of erm(51) and/or impaired
survival when isolates carry both genes. Isolates carrying erm(51) are closely
related genetically and were likely selected by antimicrobial exposure in the
environment.
