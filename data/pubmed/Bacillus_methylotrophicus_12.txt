Root exudates play a critical role in root-microbe interactions. Agrobacterium
tumefaciens causes crown gall disease in multiple plant species, but the rose
root exudates-mediated inhibition of Agrobacterium in the rhizosphere is poorly
understood. In this study, the influence of preinoculation with beneficial
bacteria or pathogens on root exudates and subsequent colonization by A.
tumefaciens was investigated in a split-root system. We found that preinoculation
of rose plants in a split-root system with Bacillus velezensis CLA178 or A.
tumefaciens C58 inhibited the subsequent colonization by C58. The root secretion 
of valine had positive effects on the chemotaxis, biofilm formation, colonization
of C58 and crown gall disease severity, but the secretion of valine decreased
significantly when Rosa multiflora plants were preinoculated with CLA178 or C58. 
These results indicated that the rose plants reduced the root secretion of valine
in response to microbial colonization, thereby reducing the colonization of
Agrobacterium and disease severity. This study provides new insights into the
root exudates-mediated interactions of rose plants, B. velezensis and A.
tumefaciens, and proposes a potential way for controlling crown gall disease.
