This work aimed at elucidating the role of bacteria present in the gut of the
earthworm Metaphire posthuma in plant growth promotion and toxic trace elements
(TTEs) bioremediation. We isolated and identified three bacterial strains
Bacillus safensis (MF 589718), Bacillus flexus (MF 589717) and Staphylococcus
haemolyticus (MF 589719) among which the Bacillus strains appeared to be
significantly more potent than the Staphylococcus strain (P < 0.05) in promoting 
plant growth and removing TTE (Cr(VI), Cu(II) and Zn(II)) from aqueous media.
These strains exhibited several plant growth promoting traits (e.g., indole
acetic acid (IAA), gibberellic acid (GA) and ammonium ion production,
1-aminocyclopropane- 1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase activity, and phosphate
solubilizing potential). In a pot trial, the gut isolates improved Vigna radiata 
seed germination, and enhanced the leaf area (30-79%), total chlorophyll content 
(26-67%) and overall root-shoot biomass (32-83%) as compared to the control.
Bacillus safensis and Bacillus flexus were equipotent in removing Cr(VI) (40.5
and 40.3%) from aqueous media; the former triumphed for Zn(II) removal (52.8%),
while the latter performed better for Cu(II) removal (43.5%). The gut isolates
successfully solubilized phosphate even in TTE-contaminated conditions. The
results demonstrate that the earthworm's enteric bacteria possess inherent plant 
growth promoting, TTE resistance and phosphate solubilization (even under TTE
stress) properties which can be further explored for their application in
sustainable crop production and environmental management.
