A 69-year-old man had experienced right chest pain for several months. Chest
computed tomography (CT) showed a right upper lobe lung tumor and swelling of
multiple mediastinal and right hilar lymph node. Three punctures to 4R lymph
nodes and two punctures to 11i lymph nodes were performed, using endobronchial
ultrasonography. Thirty days after punctures, he was admitted with appetite loss 
and general fatigue. Chest CT supposed the evidence of mediastinitis and
pericarditis. Despite the antibiotics, cardiac tamponade developed on the third
hospital day. Pericardial fenestration and pericardial drainage were performed.
Gram-positive cocci were identified and Gemella sanguinis was eventually
identified as the microbial identification system. Like the former reports, the
necessity of surgical procedure for late onset of mediastinitis and pericarditis.
caused by EBUS-TBNA was suggested.
