We report the complete genome sequence of Clostridium innocuum ATCC 14501, which 
was isolated in 1962 from an appendiceal abscess. At that time, the isolated
strain was designated C. innocuum, given its suspected lack of virulence, but
recent reports suggest that C. innocuum is an emerging pathogen.
