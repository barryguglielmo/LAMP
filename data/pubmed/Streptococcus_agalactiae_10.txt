Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a human pathogenic bacteria inducing a strong
inflammatory response that may be detrimental for host tissues if not finely
regulated. The inflammatory response can be modulated by different molecular
mechanisms, among which growing evidences point toward the crucial role of
microRNAs. Regarding innate inflammatory response, studies have reported that
miR-223 is essential for the control of granulocyte proliferation and activation.
Moreover, number of investigations on miRNA expression profiling performed in
various inflammatory settings reveal that miR-223 is among the top differentially
expressed miRNA. Yet, the dynamic pattern of expression of miR-223 in vivo with
respect to the evolution of the inflammatory process, especially in microbial
infection, remains elusive. In this study, we analyzed the kinetic expression of 
miR-223 in an inflammatory model of GBS-induced murine pneumoniae and looked for 
correlates with inflammatory markers including innate cell infiltrates. We found 
that miR-223 expression is rapidly induced at very early time points (3-6 h post 
infection) mainly by lung infiltrating neutrophils. Interestingly, the level of
miR-223 accumulating in the lungs remains higher at later stages of infection
(24h and 48h pi) and this correlates with reduced expression of primary
inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and with a shift in infiltrating monocyte
and macrophage subtypes toward regulatory phenotype. Transient inhibition of
miR223 by an antagomir resulted in significant increase of CXCL2 expression and
partial enhancing of infiltrating neutrophils in GBS infected lung tissues. This 
suggests the potential contribution of miR-223 to the resolution phase of
GBS-induced acute inflammation.
