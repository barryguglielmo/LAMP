Acne is a skin disease common in adolescents and increasingly common in the adult
population. The major pathologic events of acne vulgaris include increased sebum 
production, retention hyperkeratosis, carrying commensal skin microbiota, and
inflammation. In recent years, more than 10,000 compounds have been isolated and 
identified from marine organisms. The aim of this study was to discover the
potential anti-acne activity of fraction 9 + 10 (SF-E) of Sinularia flexibilis
extract and six cembrene diterpenoids. We found that the SF-E significantly
reduced Cutibacterium acnes-induced edema in Wistar rat ears. The cembrene
diterpenoids including 11-dehydrosinulariolide (SC-2),
3,4:8,11-bisepoxy-7-acetoxycembra-15(17)-en-1,12-olide (SC-7), and sinularin
(SC-9) reduced nitric oxide (NO) production with 50% inhibitory concentration of 
5.66 ± 0.19, 15.25 ± 0.25, and 3.85 ± 0.25 μM, respectively, and inducible NO
synthase expression in RAW 264.7 cells. Moreover, treatment with SC-2, SC-7, and 
SC-9 significantly suppressed lipopolysaccharide- and heat-killed C.
acnes-induced expression of proteins involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase
pathway in both RAW 264.7 and HaCaT cells. After treatment with SC-2, SC-7, and
SC-9, over-proliferation of HaCaT cells was significantly terminated. In summary,
SC-2, SC-7, and SC-9 showed anti-inflammatory effects in RAW 264.7 cells,
suggesting that these cembrene diterpenoids obtained from S. flexibilis are
natural marine products with potential anti-acne activities.
