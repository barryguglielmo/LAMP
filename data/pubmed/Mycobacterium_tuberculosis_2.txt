Multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains a major public health
threat; its management poses a significant economic burden. Treatment requires a 
programmatic approach with access to laboratory services, second-line
medications, and adequate clinical resources. In recent years, we have seen rapid
developments in diagnostic techniques with whole genome sequencing-based drug
susceptibility prediction now in reach, an array of new drugs that transform
treatment regimens to purely oral formulations, and a steady stream of
multinational trials that inform us about most efficient combinations. Our hope
is that the current momentum keeps the ambitious goal to end tuberculosis in 2030
in reach.
