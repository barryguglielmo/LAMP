The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of surface hydrophobicity 
and roughness of carrier materials on the inactivation of bacterial spores with
gaseous hydrogen peroxide whereas condensate formation is prevented. Spores of
Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus atrophaeus were applied either as single spore
culture or as a mixed spore population to simulate natural contamination with
microorganisms of different characteristics. Inactivation with gaseous hydrogen
peroxide was carried out at 5200 ppm hydrogen peroxide without condensate
formation. The inactivation results of B. subtilis and B. atrophaeus spores on
carrier materials with varying surface hydrophobicity differed significantly.
However, inactivation of the mixed spore populations resulted in similar
resistance compared to the single spore batches. The results of this study
indicate that surface hydrophobicity most probably has an impact on the
inactivation with gaseous hydrogen peroxide whereas surface roughness only plays 
a minor role.
