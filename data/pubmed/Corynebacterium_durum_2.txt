OBJECTIVES: To determine if chewing gum containing casein phosphopeptide
stabilised amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) promoted an increase in the
abundance of Streptococcus sanguinis and other species associated with dental
health in supragingival plaque in a clinical study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen participants were recruited for a three-leg
cross-over, randomised, controlled clinical trial. Participants chewed a
sugar-free gum with or without CPP-ACP six times daily for 20 min over two weeks.
The study also involved no gum chewing (no gum) for the same two week period.
Participants were randomly assigned to one of the test gums or no gum for each
intervention period. Participants abstained from oral hygiene and had washout
periods of two weeks between intervention periods. After each intervention
period, supragingival plaque was collected and analysed for bacterial composition
by sequencing the V4 variable region of the 16S rRNA gene. Data were analysed
using a linear mixed model.
RESULTS: The CPP-ACP gum intervention produced a significant (p < 0.01) increase 
in the proportions of S. sanguinis (112%), as well as the commensal species
Rothia dentocariosa (127%), Corynebacterium durum (80%) and Streptococcus mitis
(55%) when compared with the no gum intervention. All the species that were
promoted by the CPP-ACP gum are known to possess one or both of the
alkali-producing enzymes arginine deiminase and nitrate reductase.
CONCLUSION: This clinical study demonstrated that chewing a sugar-free gum
containing CPP-ACP promoted prebiosis by significantly increasing the proportion 
of S. sanguinis and other health-associated bacterial species in supragingival
plaque.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Regular chewing of CPP-ACP sugar-free gum increases the
proportions of health-associated commensal species in supragingival plaque to
promote prebiosis and oral homeostasis.
