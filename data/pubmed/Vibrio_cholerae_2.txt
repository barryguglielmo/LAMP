In order to control and eradicate epidemic cholera, we need to understand how
epidemics begin, how they spread, and how they decline and eventually end. This
requires extensive sampling of epidemic disease over time, alongside the
background of endemic disease that may exist concurrently with the epidemic. The 
unique circumstances surrounding the Argentinian cholera epidemic of 1992-1998
presented an opportunity to do this. Here, we use 490 Argentinian V. cholerae
genome sequences to characterise the variation within, and between, epidemic and 
endemic V. cholerae. We show that, during the 1992-1998 cholera epidemic, the
invariant epidemic clone co-existed alongside highly diverse members of the
Vibrio cholerae species in Argentina, and we contrast the clonality of epidemic
V. cholerae with the background diversity of local endemic bacteria. Our findings
refine and add nuance to our genomic definitions of epidemic and endemic cholera,
and are of direct relevance to controlling current and future cholera epidemics.
