BACKGROUND: Symbiotic bacteria play a critical role in insect's biology. They
also offer great opportunities to improve on current pest management techniques. 
In order to exploit and integrate the roles played by the gut microbiota on pest 
management programs, a better understanding of the structural organization of the
microbial community in the Chinese citrus fly Bactrocera minax is essential.
RESULTS: The results revealed a total of 162 OTUs at 97% similarity interval. The
dominant bacteria phyla were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Antinobacteria and
Firmicutes, with the Proteobacteria having the highest relative abundance (more
than 80% in all life stages). There was also a shift in the dominant OTUs from
the early developmental stages to the late developmental stages and adult
stages in B. minax. These OTUs related to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia
rettgeri and Enterobacter aerogenes, respectively. Six bacteria OTU were shared
by all the life stages. These belonged to the Enterobacteriaceae and the
Enterococcaceae families.
CONCLUSION: The common bacteria groups shared by all the life stages and other
fruit flies could be important targets for further research. This should aim
towards realizing how these bacteria affect the biology of the fly and how their 
relationship could be exploited in the development of sustainable management
strategies against fruit flies.
