Rabbit meat bekasam is a traditional fermentation product from Indonesia. This
study aimed to determine the chemical and microbiological characteristics of
rabbit meat bekasam during the fermentation process in order to isolate,
characterize (in vitro and in vivo), and identify lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as
the probiotic candidate. The chemical contents of bekasam on 7-day fermentation
were investigated in explorative and experimental methods in a completely
randomized design. A proximate analysis reported a decrease in the moisture
content, fat and carbohydrate content, and an increase in protein content. Also, 
lactic acid content was increased from 0.48% to 1.12%, and pH was decreased from 
5.3 to 4.3. Other properties indicated different values, such as bacteria
(2.75×106 to 4.45×107 CFU/g), total LAB (3.82×106 to 4.67×108 CFU/g), total yeast
(9.89×106 to 3.82×108 CFU/g) and total mould (4.34×101 to 4.86×103 CFU/g). The
experiment produced nine LAB isolates, including two probiotics subjected to
further 16S rRNA gene analysis, which indicated that Lactobacillus buchneri was
the potential probiotic isolate. After being tested on BALB/c mice, L. buchneri
could improve the immune system by inhibiting the growth of Coliform and
Salmonella.
