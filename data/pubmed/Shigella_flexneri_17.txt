Shigella, a major cause of bacterial dysentery, knows when it is not wanted. To
generate and maintain its niche within host cells, this unwelcome guest injects
several dozen virulence factors via a type 3 secretion system (T3SS). In this
issue, Ashida et al (2020) have elucidated the role of two such factors from
Shigella flexneri-OspC1 and OspD3-that together counteract apoptotic and
necroptotic death pathways in colonised epithelial cells. As a result, Shigella
can replicate to high levels within the colonic epithelium, leading to the
substantial epithelial damage in shigellosis and efficient bacterial release for 
faecal transmission.
