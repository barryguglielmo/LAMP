Spain.

Carretero O, Reyes C, San-Juan R, Chaves F, LÃ³pez-Roa P.

Bacterial infection is a well-known complication of breast implant surgery. We
identified Mycobacterium senegalense, the principal pathogen of bovine farcy of
cattle, in a woman after implant-based breast reconstruction. This finding
indicates that unusual pathogens should be considered as an etiology of infected 
breast prostheses.
