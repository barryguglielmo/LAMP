OBJECTIVE: Although infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii are often
healthcare-acquired, difficult to treat, and associated with high mortality,
epidemiologic data for this organism are limited. We describe the epidemiology,
clinical characteristics, and outcomes for patients with extensively
drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (XDRAB).
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Department of Veterans' Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs).
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with XDRAB cultures (defined as nonsusceptible to at least
1 agent in all but 2 or fewer classes) at VAMCs between 2012 and 2018.
METHODS: Microbiology and clinical data was extracted from national VA datasets. 
We used descriptive statistics to summarize patient characteristics and outcomes 
and bivariate analyses to compare outcomes by culture source.
RESULTS: Among 11,546 patients with 15,364 A. baumannii cultures, 408 (3.5%)
patients had 667 (4.3%) XDRAB cultures. Patients with XDRAB were older (mean age,
68 years; SD, 12.2) with median Charlson index 3 (interquartile range, 1-5).
Respiratory specimens (n = 244, 36.6%) and urine samples (n = 187, 28%) were the 
most frequent sources; the greatest proportion of patients were from the South (n
= 162, 39.7%). Most patients had had antibiotic exposures (n = 362, 88.7%) and
hospital or long-term care admissions (n = 331, 81%) in the prior 90 days.
Polymyxins, tigecycline, and minocycline demonstrated the highest susceptibility.
Also, 30-day mortality (n = 96, 23.5%) and 1-year mortality (n = 199, 48.8%) were
high, with significantly higher mortality in patients with blood cultures.
CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of Acinetobacter baumannii in the VA that was XDR was
low, but treatment options are extremely limited and clinical outcomes were poor.
Prevention of healthcare-associated XDRAB infection should remain a priority, and
novel antibiotics for XDRAB treatment are urgently needed.
