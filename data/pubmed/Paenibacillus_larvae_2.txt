American foulbrood is one of the most serious and yet unsolved problems of
beekeeping around the world, because it causes a disease leading to the weakening
of the vitality of honey bee populations and huge economic losses both in
agriculture and horticulture. The etiological agent of this dangerous disease is 
an extremely pathogenic spore-forming bacterium, Paenibacillus larvae, which
makes treatment very difficult. What is more, the use of antibiotics in the
European Union is forbidden due to restrictions related to the prevention of the 
presence of antibiotic residues in honey, as well as the global problem of
spreading antibiotic resistance in case of bacterial strains. The only available 
solution is burning of entire bee colonies, which results in large economic
losses. Therefore, bacteriophages and their lytic enzymes can be a real effective
alternative in the treatment and prevention of this Apis mellifera disease. In
this review, we summarize phage characteristics that make them a potentially
useful tool in the fight against American foulbrood. In addition, we gathered
data regarding phage application that have been described so far, and attempted
to show practical implications and possible limitations of their usage.
