The effect of soybean meal (SBM) replacement with fermented SBM (FSBM) on ruminal
fermentation and bacterial abundance in Holstein calves was investigated in this 
study. Thirty nine calves were randomized to: (1) control: 27% SBM + 0% FSBM
(FSBM0, n = 13); (2) 18% SBM + 9% FSBM (FSBM9, n = 13); and (3) 13.5% SBM + 13.5%
FSBM (FSBM13, n = 13). SBM contained a greater amount of large peptides
containing 3 to 10 amino acids (AAs), while FSBM had a greater amount of ammonia 
nitrogen (NH3-N), free AAs, and small peptides containing 2 to 3 AAs. The calves 
fed FSBM13 had the lowest acetic acid, NH3-N, and the ratio of acetate to
propionate, with the greatest concentration of caproic acid, valeric acid and
isovaleric acid in ruminal fluid. Compared to those fed FSBM9 or FSBM13, the
calves fed FSBM0 had the greatest proportion of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and
Ruminococcus albus in rumen fluid. However, the ruminal abundance of Prevotella
ruminicola in calves fed FSBM13 was greater than in calves fed FSBM0. Network
analysis showed that the abundance of the Ruminococcus albus was associated with 
large peptides, and butyric acid was correlated with small peptide. Taken
together, our findings suggest that FSBM may have the potential to boost calf
performance by changing the fermentation products and the relative abundance of
some members of the bacterial community in the rumen.
