Background and Aim: Fermented milk can be used to produce antihypertensive
peptides. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with its proteolytic system hydrolyze milk
protein during fermentation to produce several peptides, which include
antihypertensive bioactive peptides. This study aimed to investigate the ability 
of indigenous LAB for the production of angiotensin-I-converting enzyme
inhibitory (ACE-I) peptides in fermented milk and to characterize the ACEI
peptides.
Materials and Methods: Reconstituted milk (11%) inoculated with ten LAB isolates,
and then incubated at 37°C until it reaches pH 4.6. The evaluation was carried
out for LAB count, lactic acid concentration, peptide content, and ACE-I
activity. The low molecular weight (MW) peptides (<3 kDa) were identified using
Nano LC Ultimate 3000 series system Tandem Q Exactive Plus Orbitrap
high-resolution mass spectrometry.
Results: The result showed that the ten LAB isolates were able to produce ACE-I
in fermented milk with the activities in the range of 22.78±2.55-57.36±5.40%. The
activity of ACE-I above 50% produced by Lactobacillus delbrueckii BD7,
Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis BD17, and Lactobacillus kefiri YK4 and JK17, with 
the highest activity of ACE-I produced by L. kefiri YK4 (IC50 0.261 mg/mL) and L.
kefiri JK17 (IC50 0.308 mg/mL). Results of peptide identification showed that L. 
kefiri YK 4 could release as many as 1329, while L. kefiri JK 17 could release
174 peptides. The peptides produced were 95% derived from casein. The other
peptides were from ά-lactalbumin, β-lactoglobulin, and serum amyloid A. The
peptides produced consisted of 6-19 amino acid residues, with MWs of 634-2079
Dalton and detected at 317-1093 m/z. A total of 30 peptides have been recognized 
based on literature searches as ACE-I peptides (sequence similarity: 100%).
Conclusion: L. kefiri YK4 and JK17 are the potential to be used as starter
cultures to produce the bioactive peptide as ACE-I in fermented milk.
