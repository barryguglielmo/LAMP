RNA interference is a powerful experimental tool for RNA knockdown, but not all
organisms are amenable. Here, we provide a proof of principle demonstration that 
a type III Csm effector complex can be used for programmable mRNA transcript
degradation in eukaryotes. In zebrafish, Streptococcus thermophilus Csm complex
(StCsm) proved effective for knockdown of maternally expressed EGFP in germ cells
of Tg(ddx4:ddx4-EGFP) fish. It also led to significant, albeit less drastic,
fluorescence reduction at one day postfertilization in Tg(myl7:GFP) and
Tg(fli1:EGFP) fish that express EGFP zygotically. StCsm targeted against the
endogenous tdgf1 elicited the characteristic one-eyed phenotype with greater than
50% penetrance, and hence with similar efficiency to morpholino-mediated
knockdown. We conclude that Csm-mediated knockdown is very efficient for maternal
transcripts and can also be used for mixed maternal/early zygotic and early
zygotic transcripts, in some cases reaching comparable efficiency to
morpholino-based knockdown without significant off-target effects.
