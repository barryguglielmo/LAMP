Streptococcus gallolyticus LL009 produces gallocin D, a narrow spectrum two
component bacteriocin with potent activity against vancomycin-resistant
enterococci. Gallocin D is distinct from gallocin A, a separate two component
bacteriocin produced by S. gallolyticus. Although the gene clusters encoding
gallocin A and gallocin D have a high degree of gene synteny, the structural
genes are highly variable and appear to have undergone gene shuffling with other 
streptococcal species. Gallocin D was analysed in laboratory-based experiments.
The mature peptides are 3,343 ± 1 Da and 3,019 ± 1 Da and could be readily
synthesized and display activity against a vancomycin resistant Enterococcus
strain EC300 with a MIC value of 1.56 µM. Importantly, these bacteriocins could
contribute to the ability of S. gallolyticus to colonize the colon where they
have been associated with colorectal cancer.
