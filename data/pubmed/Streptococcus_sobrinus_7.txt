OBJECTIVES: To investigate the antibacterial effect of a new bioactive glasses on
cariogenic bacteria.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A newly developed bioactive glass named Huaxi bioactive
glass-ceramic (HX-BGC) and its antibacterial effects were investigated. 3 M™
Specialty Glass 19933 (SG) was used as the positive control while deionized water
was used as a negative control. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and
the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of HX-BGC and SG against four
cariogenic bacteria (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus 
acidophilius, Lactobacillus rhamnosus) were determined by a microdilution method.
Subsequently, bacterial growth and acid production were assessed by co-culturing 
the four cariogenic bacteria species with HX-BGC or SG at different
concentrations anaerobically at 37 °C. Optical density (at 660 nm) was assessed
by a microplate reader and the acidity of the supernatant was measured by a pH
electrode at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. Microbial kinetics, morphology and viability
were evaluated by counting colony forming units (CFU), scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), respectively.
RESULTS: The MBC of HX-BGC againstS.mutans, S.sobrinus, L.acidophilus and
L.rhamnosus were 15.63 mg/mL, 15.63 mg/mL, 7.81 mg/mL and 62.5 mg/mL,
respectively. The optical density (7.8 mg/mL) value of the bacterial suspensions 
did not change during the 48 h of culture. The acidity of bacterial suspension
kept steady at around pH 8.8. Results from counting the CFU indicated that HX-BGC
had stronger antibacterial effect when compare to SG, which is consistent with
the SEM and CLSM results.
CONCLUSIONS: HX-BGC inhibits acid production and growth of cariogenic bacteria.
