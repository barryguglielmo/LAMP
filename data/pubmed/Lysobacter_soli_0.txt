A novel proteobacterial strain designated SYSU H10001T was isolated from a soil
sample collected from plateau meadow in Hongyuan county, Sichuan province,
south-western China. The taxonomic position of the strain was investigated using 
a polyphasic approach. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities and
phylogenetic analysis, strain SYSU H10001T was most closely related to Lysobacter
soli KCTC 22011T (98.6%, sequence similarity) and Lysobacter panacisoli JCM
19212T (98.2%). The prediction result of secondary metabolites based on genome
shown that the strain SYSU H10001T contained 3 clusters of bacteriocins, 1
cluster of non-ribosomal peptide synthetase, 1 cluster of type 1 polyketide
synthase and 1 cluster of arylpolyene. In addition, the major isoprenoid quinone 
was Q-8 and the major fatty acids were identified as iso-C15:0, iso-C17:0 and
Summed feature 9. The polar lipids contained diphosphatidylglycerol,
phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and three unidentified
phospholipids. The genomic DNA G + C content of strain SYSU H10001T was 66.5%
(genome). On the basis of phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic data, strain
SYSU H10001T represents a novel species of the genus Lysobacter, for which the
name Lysobacter prati sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SYSU H10001T
(= KCTC 72062T = CGMCC 1.16662T).
