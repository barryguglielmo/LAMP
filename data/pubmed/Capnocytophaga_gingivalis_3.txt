Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the leading cause of mortality for oral
cancer. Numerous risk factors mainly related to unhealthy habits and responsible 
for chronic inflammation and infections have been recognized as predisposing
factors for oral carcinogenesis. Recently, even microbiota alterations have been 
associated with the development of human cancers. In particular, some specific
bacterial strains have been recognized and strongly associated with oral cancer
development (Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Fusobacterium spp., Streptococcus spp.,
Peptostreptococcus spp., Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella spp.). Several
hypotheses have been proposed to explain how the oral microbiota could be
involved in cancer pathogenesis by mainly paying attention to chronic
inflammation, microbial synthesis of cancerogenic substances, and alteration of
epithelial barrier integrity. Based on knowledge of the carcinogenic effects of
dysbiosis, it was recently suggested that probiotics may have anti-tumoral
activity. Nevertheless, few data exist with regard to probiotic effects on oral
cancer. On this basis, the association between the development of oral cancer and
oral dysbiosis is discussed focusing attention on the potential benefits of
probiotics administration in cancer prevention.
