Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is a central enzyme for DNA building block
synthesis. Most aerobic organisms, including nearly all eukaryotes, have class I 
RNRs consisting of R1 and R2 subunits.  The catalytic R1 subunit contains an
overall activity site that can allosterically turn the enzyme on or off by the
binding of ATP or dATP, respectively. The mechanism behind the ability to turn
the enzyme off via the R1 subunit involves the formation of different types of R1
oligomers in most studied species and R1-R2 octamers in Escherichia coli. To
better understand the distribution of different oligomerization mechanisms, we
characterized the enzyme from Clostridium botulinum, which belongs to a subclass 
of class I RNRs not studied before.  The recombinantly expressed enzyme was
analyzed by size exclusion chromatography, gas-phase electrophoretic mobility
macromolecular analysis, electron microscopy, x-ray crystallography, and enzyme
assays. Interestingly, it shares the ability of the E. coli RNR to form inhibited
R1-R2 octamers in the presence of dATP but, unlike the E. coli enzyme, cannot be 
turned off by combinations of ATP and dGTP/dTTP. A phylogenetic analysis of class
I RNRs suggests that activity regulation is not ancestral, but was gained after
the first subclasses diverged and that RNR subclasses with inhibition mechanisms 
involving R1 oligomerization belong to a clade separated from the two subclasses 
forming R1-R2 octamers. These results give further insight into activity
regulation in class I RNRs as an evolutionarily dynamic process.
