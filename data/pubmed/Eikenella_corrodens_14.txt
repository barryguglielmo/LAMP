Gram-positive cocci species, notably Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and
Enterococcus account for 80 to 90% of infective endocarditis cases. HACEK
microorganisms (Haemophilus spp., Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,
Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella kingae) account for
approximately 3% of cases and Candida species account for 1-2% of cases.
Micrococcus luteus is a rare cause of endocarditis. To our knowledge, only 17
cases of prosthetic valve endocarditis have been described due to M. luteus and a
single case of native aortic valve endocarditis has been described. The following
case is the only documented case of native mitral valve endocarditis. A review of
the literature pertaining to Micrococcus endocarditis was performed to further
characterize the entity.
