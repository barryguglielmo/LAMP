A series of benzylaminoethylureido-tailed benzenesulfonamides was analyzed for
their inhibition potential against bacterial carbonic anhydrases (CAs) such as
VhCA α, β, and γ from Vibrio cholerae , and BpsCA β and γ-CAs from Burkholderia
pseudomallei . Growing drug-resistance against antibiotics demands alternative
targets and mechanisms of action. As CA is essential for the survival of
bacteria, such enzymes have the potential for developing new antibiotics. Most of
the compounds presented excellent inhibition potential against VhCA γ as compared
to α and β, with K i s in the range of 82.5 - 191.4 nM. Several sulfonamides
presented excellent inhibition against BpsCA β with K i s in the range of 394 -
742.8 nM. Recently it has been demonstrated that sufonamides CA inhibitors are
effective against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus. Such data proved that CA
inhibition of pathogenic bacteria may lead to a new class of antibiotics.
