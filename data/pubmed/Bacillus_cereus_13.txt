Mosquito-borne diseases are a large problem in Vietnam as elsewhere. Due to
environmental concerns regarding the use of synthetic insecticides as well as
developing insecticidal resistance, there is a need for environmentally-benign
alternative mosquito control agents. In addition, resistance of pathogenic
microorganisms to antibiotics is an increasing problem. As part of a program to
identify essential oils as alternative larvicidal and antimicrobial agents, the
leaf, stem, and rhizome essential oils of several Zingiber species, obtained from
wild-growing specimens in northern Vietnam, were acquired by hydrodistillation
and investigated using gas chromatography. The mosquito larvicidal activities of 
the essential oils were assessed against Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes
albopictus, and Ae. aegypti, and for antibacterial activity against a selection
of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and for activity against Candida
albicans. Zingiber essential oils rich in α-pinene and β-pinene showed the best
larvicidal activity. Zingiber nudicarpum rhizome essential oil showed excellent
antibacterial activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and 
Bacillus cereus, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 2, 8, and 1
μg/mL, respectively. However, the major components, α-pinene and β-pinene, cannot
explain the antibacterial activities obtained.
