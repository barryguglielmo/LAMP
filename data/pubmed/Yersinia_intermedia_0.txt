Five bacterial (facultatively) anaerobic strains, namely Buttiauxella sp.
MASE-IM-9, Clostridium sp. MASE-IM-4, Halanaerobium sp. MASE-BB-1, Trichococcus
sp. MASE-IM-5, and Yersinia intermedia MASE-LG-1 isolated from different extreme 
natural environments were subjected to Mars relevant environmental stress factors
in the laboratory under controlled conditions. These stress factors encompassed
low water activity, oxidizing compounds, and ionizing radiation. Stress tests
were performed under permanently anoxic conditions. The survival rate after
addition of sodium perchlorate (Na-perchlorate) was found to be species-specific.
The inter-comparison of the five microorganisms revealed that Clostridium sp.
MASE-IM-4 was the most sensitive strain (D10-value (15 min, NaClO4) = 0.6 M). The
most tolerant microorganism was Trichococcus sp. MASE-IM-5 with a calculated
D10-value (15 min, NaClO4) of 1.9 M. Cultivation in the presence of
Na-perchlorate in Martian relevant concentrations up to 1 wt% led to the
observation of chains of cells in all strains. Exposure to Na-perchlorate led to 
a lowering of the survival rate after desiccation. Consecutive exposure to
desiccating conditions and ionizing radiation led to additive effects. Moreover, 
in a desiccated state, an enhanced radiation tolerance could be observed for the 
strains Clostridium sp. MASE-IM-4 and Trichococcus sp. MASE-IM-5. These data show
that anaerobic microorganisms from Mars analogue environments can resist a
variety of Martian-simulated stresses either individually or in combination.
However, responses were species-specific and some Mars-simulated extremes killed 
certain organisms. Thus, although Martian stresses would be expected to act
differentially on microorganisms, none of the expected extremes tested here and
found on Mars prevent the growth of anaerobic microorganisms.
