The reactions of
2,4-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3-dithio-2,4-diphosphetane-2,4-disulfide (Lawesson's
Reagent, LR) with benzylamine (BzNH2) and 4-phenylbutylamine (PhBuNH2) yield
benzylammonium P-(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-benzyl-amidodithiophosphonate
(BzNH3)(BzNH-adtp) and 4-phenylbutylammonium
P-(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-(4-phenylbutyl)-amidodithiophosphonate
(PhBuNH3)(PhBuNH-adtp). The relevant nickel complexes [Ni(BzNH-adtp)2] and
[Ni(PhBuNH-adtp)2] and the corresponding hydrolysed derivatives
(BzNH3)2[Ni(dtp)2] and (PhBuNH3)2[Ni(dtp)2] were prepared and fully
characterized. The antimicrobial activity of the aforementioned
amidodithiophosphonates against a set of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogen
bacteria was evaluated, and [Ni(BzNH-adtp)2] and [Ni(PhBuNH-adtp)2] showed
antiproliferative activity towards Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus
haemolyticus strains. density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed
to shed some light on the activity of reported compounds related to their
tendency towards P-N bond cleavage.
