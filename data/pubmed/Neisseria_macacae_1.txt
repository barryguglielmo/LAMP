The Gram-negative diplococcus Neisseria macacae is a commensal bacterium of the
mucosal surfaces in humans. A 52-year-old woman receiving continuous ambulatory
peritoneal dialysis was admitted because of abdominal pain and turbid peritoneal 
fluid. N. macacae was isolated from peritoneal fluid culture and showed
susceptibility to ceftriaxone. Despite appropriate antibiotics, the peritonitis
was refractory, leading to the removal of the peritoneal dialysis catheter. We
herein report the first case of peritoneal dialysis peritonitis caused by
Neisseria macacae and review previous case reports of N. macacae infection in
humans.
