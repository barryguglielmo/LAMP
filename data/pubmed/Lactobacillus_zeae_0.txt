Taxonomic relationships between Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasei and 
Lactobacillus zeae have long been debated. Results of previous analyses have
shown that overall genome relatedness indices (such as average nucleotide
identity and core nucleotide identity) between the type strains L. casei ATCC
393T and L. zeae ATCC 15820T were 94.6 and 95.3 %, respectively, which are
borderline for species definition. However, the digital DNA‒DNA hybridization
value was 57.3 %, which was clearly lower than the species delineation threshold 
of 70 %, and hence raised the possibility that L. casei could be reclassified
into two species. To re-evaluate the taxonomic relationship of these taxa,
multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) based on the concatenated five housekeeping
gene (dnaJ, dnaK, mutL, pheS and yycH) sequences, phylogenomic and core genome
multilocus sequence typing analyses, gene presence and absence profiles using
pan-genome analysis, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight
mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) profiling analysis, cellular fatty acid
compositions, and phenotype analysis were carried out. The results of phenotypic 
characterization, MLSA, whole-genome sequence-based analyses and MALDI-TOF MS
profiling justified an independent species designation for the L. zeae strains,
and supported an emended the description of the name of Lactobacillus zeae (ex
Kuznetsov 1956) Dicks et al. 1996, with ATCC 15820T (=DSM 20178T=BCRC 17942T) as 
the type strain.
