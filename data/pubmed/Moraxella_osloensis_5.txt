A-26-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with diffuse abdominal pain,
nausea, and vomiting. He had a history of malignant nephrosclerosis, for which he
had been receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD) for the past 14 months. His PD
effluent was cloudy and turbid (white blood cell count, 10,528/μL; neutrophils
95.2%). A Gram-negative coccobacillus was isolated from peritoneal fluid culture.
However, the organism could not be identified by matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (Vitek MS, 
bioMérieux), but was identified as Moraxella osloensis by the 16S rRNA gene
sequencing. He was successfully treated with intraperitoneal cefazolin therapy
for 3 weeks without removing the intra-abdominal catheter. A literature review
revealed three previous case reports all of which were diagnosed by MALDI
Biotyper (Bruker Daltonics), suggesting that the identification of M. osloensis
may vary depending on the type of MALDI-TOF MS system. In conclusion, we
experienced a case of M. osloensis infection in a PD patient, which was
successfully treated by antibiotic treatment, without removing the PD catheter.
