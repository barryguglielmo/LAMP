Infections caused by carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae have become a
major threat to public health, worldwide. Here we report clinically significant
NDM-1 and VIM-1 producing Moellerella wisconsensis which has not yet been
described in the literature; this is the first report of M. wisconsensis strain
harbouring blaNDM-1 and blaVIM-1, recovered from the rectal swab of a low birth
weight female child admitted in NICU of the north Indian tertiary care hospital. 
A plasmid of IncW incompatibility with size of 154 kb was observed in AK-92
strain.
