Synbiotic supplements contain pre- and probiotics and are used to modulate gut
microbiota composition. This study aimed to investigate effects of two synbiotic 
mixtures on human faecal bacteria in vitro. Short chain fructooligosaccharides
(FOS) (1% w/v) combined with either Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 or
Bifidobacterium lactis HN019 (106 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL)] were added to
pH-controlled anaerobic batch cultures inoculated with human faeces. Maltodextrin
(1% w/v), FOS (1% w/v) and the probiotic strains were also tested individually.
Effects on bacteria, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and branched-chain fatty
acids (BCFAs) were assessed over 48 h. With maltodextrin, FOS and the synbiotic
mixtures, there was a significant increase in total bacteria and bifidobacteria
numbers, compared to the negative control or probiotics alone. Increases in
Atopobium cluster and Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale group occurred
with FOS and maltodextrin, respectively. Additionally, maltodextrin, FOS and
synbiotics resulted in a greater production of acetate and butyrate (SCFAs)
compared to the negative control and probiotics alone, whereas concentrations of 
iso-valerate (BCFA) were lower with these treatments. In conclusion,
synbiotic-induced in vitro bacterial changes and changes in SCFAs concentrations 
were not different from those observed with FOS alone. These data suggest that
metabolic effects of these synbiotics are largely driven by the prebiotic
component.
