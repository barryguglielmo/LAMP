BACKGROUND: The impact of appropriate antimicrobial therapy for A. baumannii
bacteremic pneumonia has not been well established due to the inclusion of the
three phenotypically indistinguishable Acinetobacter species and confounding
factors including underlying diseases and severity of infection. This
retrospective study aimed to evaluate the impact of appropriate antimicrobial
therapy on 14-day mortality in A. baumannii bacteremic pneumonia patients after
adjusting for risk factors.
METHODS: This study was conducted at five medical centers in Taiwan between July 
2012 and June 2016. A. baumannii species identification was performed using
reference molecular methods. Risk factors for 14-day mortality were analyzed via 
logistic regression. The interaction between the Acute Physiology and Chronic
Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score and appropriate antimicrobial therapy was
assessed using the logistic model.
RESULTS: A total of 336 patients with monomicrobial A. baumannii bacteremic
pneumonia were included in this study. The overall 14-day mortality rate was
47.3%. The crude mortality of appropriate antimicrobial therapy was 35.9% (57 of 
151 patients). Appropriate antimicrobial therapy was associated with a lower
mortality after multivariate adjustment (odds ratio [OR], 0.57; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 0.34-0.97; p = 0.04), and the effect was influenced by APACHE II
score (OR for interaction term, 0.0098; 95% CI, 0.0005-0.1885; p = 0.002).
Further analysis demonstrated that appropriate antimicrobial therapy
significantly reduced 14-day mortality among the patients with an APACHE II
score > 35 (OR 0.0098; 95% CI 0.0005-0.1885).
CONCLUSION: Appropriate antimicrobial therapy decreases 14-day mortality of the
most severely ill patients with A. baumannii bacteremic pneumonia.
