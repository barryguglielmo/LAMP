BACKGROUND: Most lactobacilli found in animal intestines are generally
non-motile, but there are few exceptions. Our previous work showed that
Lactobacillus agilis BKN88, which is a highly motile strain originating from a
chicken, takes advantage of motility in gut colonization in murine models, and
thus motile lactobacilli likely have unique ecological characteristics conferred 
by motility. However, the ecology and habitat of gut-derived motile lactobacilli 
are still rarely understood. In addition, the limited availability of motile
Lactobacillus isolates is one of the major obstacles for further studies. To gain
insight into the ecology and habitat of the motile lactobacilli, we established a
routinely applicable detection method for motile lactobacilli using PCR and
subsequent selective isolation in semi-solid MRS medium for the collection of
additional motile lactobacilli from animal feces.
RESULTS: We applied the PCR detection using motile lactobacilli-specific primers,
based on the motor switch protein gene (fliG) of flagella, to 120 animal feces,
followed by selective isolation performed using 45 animal feces. As a result,
motile lactobacilli were detected in 44 animal feces. In the selective isolation,
29 isolates of L. agilis and 2 isolates of L. ruminis were obtained from 8 animal
species.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that motile lactobacilli are distributed in 
different animal species. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis of the L. agilis
isolates suggests co-evolution with the host, and adaptation to a particular
environmental niche.
