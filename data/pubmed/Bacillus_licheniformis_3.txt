The enantioselective synthesis of α-hydroxy ketones and vicinal diols is an
intriguing field because of the broad applicability of these molecules. Although,
butandiol dehydrogenases are known to play a key role in the production of
2,3-butandiol, their potential as biocatalysts is still not well studied. Here,
we investigate the biocatalytic properties of the meso-butanediol dehydrogenase
from Bacillus licheniformis DSM 13T (BlBDH). The encoding gene was cloned with an
N-terminal StrepII-tag and recombinantly overexpressed in E. coli. BlBDH is
highly active towards several non-physiological diketones and α-hydroxyketones
with varying aliphatic chain lengths or even containing phenyl moieties. By
adjusting the reaction parameters in biotransformations the formation of either
the α-hydroxyketone intermediate or the diol can be controlled.
