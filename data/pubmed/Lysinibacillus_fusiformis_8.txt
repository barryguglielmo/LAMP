Eleusine coracana (Finger millet) has high nutritional value with numerous health
benefits and is of low cost. Isolation of beta-glucan (βG) from E. coracana
(Ec-βG) has gained increasing research attention. UV-vis spectroscopy used to
measure the surface plasmon resonance at 361 nm to confirm the presence of
polysaccharides (glucan molecules) in Ec-βG. X-ray diffraction analysis of Ec-βG 
displayed a crystalline nature and confirmed the presence of the βG molecule.
Further, the bioactive compounds of Ec-βG were screened using gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry. The antibacterial activity of Ec-βG against
both Gram-positive (Lysinibacillus fusiformis, Enterococcus faecalis) and
Gram-negative (Proteus vulgaris, Shigella sonnei) bacteria were assessed through 
minimum inhibitory concentrations <70 μg/ml of Ec-βG. In addition, the
antibiofilm activity and bacterial viability of Ec-βG at 100 μg/ml was confirmed 
by light and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Furthermore, Ec-βG inhibits
α-amylase and α-glucosidase at an IC50 -value of 1.23 and 1.42 μg/ml,
respectively. Superoxide anion scavenging activity at IC50-1.4 μg/ml and DPPH
radical scavenging activity at IC50-1.2 μg/ml showed that Ec-βG had potential
antioxidant property. The in vitro hemolysis assay for biocompatibility of Ec-βG 
at 200 μg/ml showed 0.06 ± 0.09%. Therefore, Ec-βG has the potential to act as a 
suggestive agent for antibacterial, antidiabetic, and antioxidant activity.
