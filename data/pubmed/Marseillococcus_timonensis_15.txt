In this multicenter study, we aimed to evaluate the performance of MALDI Biotyper
and VITEK MS, for identification of Prevotella species. Three hundred and
fourteen clinical isolates, collected in eight European countries between January
2014 and April 2016, were identified at the collecting sites by MALDI Biotyper
(versions 3.0 and 3.1) and then reidentified by VITEK MS (version 3.0) in the
central laboratory. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used as a standard method.
According to sequence analysis, the 314 Prevotella strains belonged to 19
species. MALDI Biotyper correctly identified 281 (89.5%) isolates to the species 
level and 33 (10.5%) only at the genus level. VITEK MS correctly identified 253
(80.6%) isolates at the species level and 276 (87.9%) isolates at the genus
level. Thirty-three isolates belonging to P. bergensis, P. conceptionensis, P.
corporis, P. histicola, and P. nanciensis, unavailable in the VITEK MS 3.0
database, were resulted in genus level or no identification. Six Prevotella
strains, belonged to P. veroralis, P. timonensis, and P. conceptionensis not
represented in the MALDI Biotyper system database, were misidentified at the
genus level. In conclusion, both VITEK MS and MALDI Biotyper provided reliable
and rapid identification. However, the permanent extension of the databases is
needed.
