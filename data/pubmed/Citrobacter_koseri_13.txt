In this study, we determined the antimicrobial activity of ten essential oils
(EOs)-oregano, thyme, clove, arborvitae, cassia, lemongrass, melaleuca,
eucalyptus, lavender, and clary sage-against drug-resistant microorganisms
previously isolated from patients with skin infections. The essential oil
compositions were determined using gas chromatography coupled to mass
spectrometry (GC/MS). The assayed bacteria included Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter koseri, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Two
drug-resistant yeasts (Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis) were also
involved in our survey. Oregano, thyme, cassia, lemongrass and arborvitae showed 
very strong antibacterial and antifungal activity against all tested strains.
These results show that these essential oils may be effective in preventing the
growth of the drug-resistant microorganisms responsible for wound infections. In 
this study, the genotoxic effects of tested essential oils on healthy human
keratinocytes HaCaT were evaluated using the comet assay for the first time.
These results revealed that none of the essential oils induced significant DNA
damage in vitro after 24 h. Moreover, the treatment of HaCaT cells with essential
oils increased the total antioxidant status (TAS) level. The obtained results
indicate that EOs could be used as a potential source of safe and potent natural 
antimicrobial and antioxidant agents in the pharmaceutical and food industries.
