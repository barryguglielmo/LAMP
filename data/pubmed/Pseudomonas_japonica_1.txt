In this study, a pot experiment was piloted in a greenhouse to evaluate the
potential of Celosia argentea var. cristata L. for tolerating/accumulating heavy 
metals in synthetic wastewater in the presence of Pseudomonas japonica and
organic amendment, i.e., moss and compost. Two-week-old seedlings were
transferred to pots, and after 4 weeks, the bacterial strain was inoculated, then
watered with synthetic wastewater for 5 weeks and harvested after 9 weeks. After 
harvesting, physiological and biochemical parameters, as well as metal contents
of plants, were quantified. The results indicated highest growth and biomass
production in moss- and compost-associated plants while highest metal uptake has 
been found in the presence of P. japonica and synthetic wastewater-irrigated
plants. Synthetic wastewater-irrigated plants have shown highest Pb uptake of
2899 mg kg-1 DW, while with P. japonica in soil those plants have shown highest
Cd, Cu, Ni, and Cr uptake of 962, 1479, 1042, and 956 mg kg-1 DW, respectively.
The production of antioxidant enzymes, i.e., catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase
(APX), guaiacol peroxidase (GPX), and glutathione-s-transferase (GST), was high
in P. japonica-amended plants because of increased uptake of metals. It is
concluded that moss and compost have improved growth while P. japonica improved
metal accumulation and translocation to aerial parts with little involvement in
plant growth.
