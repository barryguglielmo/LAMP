Lactobacillus sakei is a nonpathogenic lactic acid bacterium and a natural
inhabitant of meat ecosystems. Although red meat is a heme-rich environment, L.
sakei does not need iron or heme for growth, although it possesses a
heme-dependent catalase. Iron incorporation into L. sakei from myoglobin and
hemoglobin was previously shown by microscopy and the L. sakei genome reveals the
complete equipment for iron and heme transport. Here, we report the
characterization of a five-gene cluster (from lsa1836 to lsa1840 [lsa1836-1840]) 
encoding a putative metal iron ABC transporter. Interestingly, this cluster,
together with a heme-dependent catalase gene, is also conserved in other species 
from the meat ecosystem. Our bioinformatic analyses revealed that the locus might
correspond to a complete machinery of an energy coupling factor (ECF) transport
system. We quantified in vitro the intracellular heme in the wild type (WT) and
in our Δlsa1836-1840 deletion mutant using an intracellular heme sensor and
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for quantifying incorporated 57Fe
heme. We showed that in the WT L. sakei, heme accumulation occurs rapidly and
massively in the presence of hemin, while the deletion mutant was impaired in
heme uptake; this ability was restored by in trans complementation. Our results
establish the main role of the L. sakei Lsa1836-1840 ECF-like system in heme
uptake. Therefore, this research outcome sheds new light on other possible
functions of ECF-like systems.IMPORTANCE Lactobacillus sakei is a nonpathogenic
bacterial species exhibiting high fitness in heme-rich environments such as meat 
products, although it does not need iron or heme for growth. Heme capture and
utilization capacities are often associated with pathogenic species and are
considered virulence-associated factors in the infected hosts. For these reasons,
iron acquisition systems have been deeply studied in such species, while for
nonpathogenic bacteria the information is scarce. Genomic data revealed that
several putative iron transporters are present in the genome of the lactic acid
bacterium L. sakei In this study, we demonstrate that one of them is an ECF-like 
ABC transporter with a functional role in heme transport. Such evidence has not
yet been brought for an ECF; therefore, our study reveals a new class of heme
transport system.
