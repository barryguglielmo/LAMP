BACKGROUND: The emergence of the New Dehli metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM) gene in
Enterobacteriaceae is responsible for multidrug resistance responsible for severe
infections and serious morbidity in patients. Our study aimed to define the
molecular characteristics and antibiogram of the NDM-1 producing
Enterobacteriaceae.
METHODS: We isolated 370 individual enterobacteria from the clinical specimens
collected from the two tertiary hospitals in Sakaka, Saudi Arabia. Bacterial
isolation was performed using standard microbiological techniques and the Phoenix
and Microscan WalkAway Plus automated analyzers. Bacterial strains were
characterized by phenotypic methods and PCR, and DNA sequencing was used for the 
molecular characterization of NDM genes.
RESULTS: The blaNDM gene was detected among the 68 members of the
Enterobacteriaceae including a single case of rarely reported Cedecea lapagei. Of
these 68, 43 isolates (63.2%) were blaNDM-1 and 25 (36.8%) were blaNDM variants. 
A statistically significant relationship between the NDM-1 and Klebsiella
pneumoniae (p = 0.004) was seen, and the relationship between the NDM variants
was significantly associated with Citrobacter freundii (p = 0.02) and Escherichia
coli (p = 0.03). The in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of
NDM-producing Enterobacteriaceae revealed a very high rate of antibiotic
resistance against several groups of antibiotics. These bacterial strains were
less resistant to two aminoglycosides, gentamicin (39; 57.3%) and amikacin (27;
39.7%), and showed minimum resistance to tigecycline (25; 36.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of a large number of NDM-1 enterobacteria in our study
identifies a substantial public concern, both within hospitals and the wider
community, and leaves us a narrow choice of therapeutic options: the
aminoglycosides, co-trimoxazole, and tigecycline.
