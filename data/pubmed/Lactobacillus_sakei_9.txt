Heavy metals are harmful to human health. Therefore, we investigated the
biosorption of heavy metals by lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Of all the tested
heavy metals, biosorption by LAB was highest for mercury, followed by lead,
cadmium, and finally arsenic. The viability of HCT-116 cells was reduced by half 
in the presence of 7.5 µg/mL mercury but recovered after the addition of selected
LAB strains. HCT-116 cells showed increased superoxide dismutase and catalase
activities, whereas glutathione peroxidase activities decreased significantly.
Addition of Lactobacillus sakei TOKAI 57m recovered all antioxidant enzyme
activities. Our results suggest that this strain can be used for cellular
detoxification.
