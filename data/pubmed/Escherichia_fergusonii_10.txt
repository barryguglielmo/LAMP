OBJECTIVES: To characterize the colistin-resistant bacterial population in the
gut and assess diversity of mcr-1 transmission within a single individual.
METHODS: Large numbers of isolates (>100 colonies/chicken cecum sample) were
collected from nine randomly selected mcr-1-positive chickens in China and used
for comprehensive microbiological, molecular and comparative genomics analyses.
RESULTS: Of 1273 colonies, 968 were mcr-1 positive (962 Escherichia coli, two
Escherichia fergusonii, two Klebsiella pneumoniae and two Klebsiella
quasipneumoniae). One to six colistin-resistant species and three to 10 E. coli
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) clusters could be identified from each
sample. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis of the representative E. coli
strains revealed three to nine sequence types observed in a single chicken host. 
The mcr-1 genes are located in either chromosomes or plasmids of different types,
including IncI2 (n=30), IncHI2 (n=14), IncX4 (n=4), p0111(n=2) and IncHI1(n=1).
Strikingly, in single cecum samples, one to five Inc type plasmids harbouring
mcr-1 could be identified. Great diversity was also observed for the same IncI2
plasmid within a single chicken host. In addition, up to eight genetic contexts
of the mcr-1 gene occurred within a single chicken.
CONCLUSIONS: There is extensive heterogeneity and flexibility of mcr-1
transmission in chicken gut due to bacterial species differences, distant clonal 
relatedness of isolates, many types and variations of mcr-positive plasmids, and 
the flexible genetic context of the mcr-1 gene. These compelling findings
indicate that the gut is a 'melting pot' for active horizontal transfer of the
mcr-1 gene.
