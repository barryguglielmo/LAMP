Several species of intestinal bacteria have been associated with enhanced
efficacy of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy, but the underlying mechanisms by
which the microbiome enhances antitumor immunity are unclear. In this study, we
isolated three bacterial species-Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, Lactobacillus
johnsonii, and Olsenella species-that significantly enhanced efficacy of immune
checkpoint inhibitors in four mouse models of cancer. We found that intestinal B.
pseudolongum modulated enhanced immunotherapy response through production of the 
metabolite inosine. Decreased gut barrier function induced by immunotherapy
increased systemic translocation of inosine and activated antitumor T cells. The 
effect of inosine was dependent on T cell expression of the adenosine A2A
receptor and required costimulation. Collectively, our study identifies a
previously unknown microbial metabolite immune pathway activated by immunotherapy
that may be exploited to develop microbial-based adjuvant therapies.
