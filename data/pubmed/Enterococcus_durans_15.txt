BACKGROUND: Chinese rice wine (CRW; a traditional alcoholic beverage in China
with unique flavor and high nutritional value) containing high level of biogenic 
amines (BAs) may be deleterious to human health. The processes of rice soaking,
primary fermentation and secondary fermentation were found to be the major
factors for accumulation of BAs during industrial CRW production.
RESULTS: To reduce the risk of the formation of BAs in CRW production,
Enterococcus durans AR315, a BA-negative lactic acid bacterium, was isolated from
CRW samples by PCR-based molecular marker reverse screening in this work. With
addition of AR315 during steeping rice phase, the level of total BAs was
significantly decreased by 45.1% in comparison with the control. Moreover, the
final BA concentration with the addition of AR315 was 27.6% lower than that of
the control during fermentation phase.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report of decreased accumulation
of BAs in CRW production using a BA-negative lactic acid bacterium. Hence, using 
a BA-negative lactic acid bacterium as a starter culture could be an efficient
strategy for significantly reducing the formation of BAs, which has the potential
for industrial application in CRW production. © 2020 Society of Chemical
