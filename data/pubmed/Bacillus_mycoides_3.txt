BACKGROUND: Avocado is affected by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides causing
anthracnose. Antagonistic microorganisms against C. gloeosporioides represent an 
alternative for biological control. Accordingly, in the present study, we focused
on the isolation and characterization of potential antagonist bacteria against a 
member of the C. gloeosporioides species complex with respect to their possible
future application.
RESULTS: Samples of avocado rhizospheric soil were aquired from an orchard
located in Ocuituco, Morelos, Mexico, aiming to obtain bacterial isolates with
potential antifungal activity. From the soil samples, 136 bacteria were isolated 
and they were then challenged against a member of the C. gloeosporioides species 
complex; only three bacterial isolates A1, A2 and A3 significantly diminished
mycelial fungal growth by 75%, 70% and 60%, respectively. Two of these isolates
were identified by 16S rRNA as Bacillus mycoides (A1 and A2) and the third was
identified as Bacillus tequilensis (A3). Bacillus mycoides bacterial cell-free
supernatant reduced the mycelial growth of a member of the C. gloeosporioides
species complex isolated from avocado by 65%, whereas Bacillus tequilensis A3
supernatant did so by 25% after 3 days post inoculation. Bacillus tequilensis
mycoides A1 was a producer of proteases, indolacetic acid and siderophores.
Preventive treatment using a cell-free supernatant of B. mycoides A1 diminished
the severity of anthracnose disease (41.9%) on avocado fruit.
CONCLUSION: These results reveal the possibility of using B. mycoides A1 as a
potential biological control agent. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.
