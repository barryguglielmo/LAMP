BACKGROUND: Kitchen sponges are a major source of cross-contamination as they can
transfer foodborne pathogens, infectious agents and spoilage causing
microorganisms to food contact surfaces. Several studies have revealed that
university students adopt poor practices regarding food safety, hygiene, and the 
handling of kitchen cleaning equipment.
METHODS: A total of fifty kitchen sponges were collected along with a
questionnaire addressing social demographics and kitchen sponge usage by students
living at the University of Sharjah dormitories. The effect of storage (3 and
10 days) on the microbial population of kitchen sponges at room temperature
(21 °C) was assessed. Enterobacteriaceae isolated from sponges were identified
and their antibiotic resistance determined.
RESULTS: Student responses revealed that kitchen sponges used to clean food
contact surfaces were also used to clean the oven (32%), sink (26%), refrigerator
(10%), and to clean spills on the floor (4%). Kitchen sponges contained high
counts of mesophilic aerobic bacteria (7.9 log10/cm3), coliform (7.2 log10/cm3), 
Enterobacteriaceae (7.3 log10/cm3) and yeasts and molds (7.0 log10/cm3). After
storage of the sponges at room temperature (21 °C) for 3 and 10 days, the number 
of mesophilic aerobic bacteria, coliform, Enterobacteriaceae and yeasts and molds
decreased by 0.4 and 1.3 log10/cm3, 0.7 and 1.4 log10/cm3, 0.4 and 1.1 log10/cm3,
and 0.6 and 1.3 log10/cm3, respectively. The most frequently isolated
Enterobacteriaceae were Enterobacter cloacae (56%) and Klebsiella oxytoca (16%). 
All E. cloacae isolates were resistant to amoxicillin, cefalotin, cefoxitin and
cefuroxime axetil.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that students living in dormitories lacked good
hygienic practices and were at increased risk of food poisoning. Kitchen sponges 
were highly contaminated with potentially pathogenic bacteria which could be
transferred from the general kitchen environment to food contact surfaces and
consequently lead to food contamination.
