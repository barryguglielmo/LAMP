Meat products contain valuable nutrients that are important for human health and 
development but are also highly susceptible to colonization by microorganisms.
This can lead to spoilage and serious foodborne illnesses. Natural antimicrobial 
peptides, produced by many organisms as part of their innate immune system to
fight microbial infections, have great potential as food preservatives. In this
study, we explored the effect of ternary antimicrobial random peptide mixtures
(RPMs) on food spoilage bacteria in minced turkey meat. Amendment of RPMs to meat
led to significant reductions in bacterial abundance in experimental tests, and
RPMs worked synergistically with nitrite to reduce bacterial loads. Using
high-throughput 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing, we characterized the 
effect of RPMs and nitrite on meat microbial community structure before and
during incubation under refrigerated conditions. Our findings reveal strong
antimicrobial activity for RPMs against spoilage bacteria in meat, including
Listeria monocytogenes and Pseudomonas putida. These results demonstrate the
potential of RPMs as a safer preservative for reducing spoilage in meat and other
food products.
