This study aimed at evaluating the antagonistic activity of 16 bacterial strains 
for the control of brown rot disease caused by Monilinia fructigena, and M. laxa 
under in vitro and a semi-commercial large-scale trial. These bacterial
antagonists' belonging to the genera Alcaligenes, Bacillus, Brevibacterium,
Pantoea, Pseudomonas, and Serratia were previously proven effective for control
of fire blight of apple. The in vitro dual culture bioassay showed the highest
inhibition rates of mycelial growth ranging from 55 to 95% and from 43 to 94% for
M. fructigena and M. laxa, respectively. The in vivo bioassay showed moderate and
strong inhibition for M. fructigena and M. laxa, respectively. The inhibition
rates were dependent on incubation time as well as pathogen virulence. The
free-cell bacterial filtrate revealed substantial mycelial growth inhibition
ranging from 66 to 86%. The inhibition of conidial germination was from 32 to
78%, suggesting the involvement of metabolites in their biocontrol activity. The 
antifungal effect of the volatile compounds (VCOs) was observed for all bacteria 
with mycelial inhibition varying from 12 to 70%. Overall, their efficacy was
substantially affected by the nature of the bacterial strains and the modes of
action. Taken together, these results underscore that ACBC1 and SF14 for M.
fructigena and SP10 and ACBP1 for M. laxa were the most effective bacterial
strains. These strains were confirmed effective in a semi-commercial large-scale 
trial. Interestingly, their efficacies were found to be comparable to those of
both commercial BCAs (B. subtilis Y1336 and P. agglomerans P10c), but slightly
lower than thiophanate-methyl fungicide. The ability of most bacterial strains to
produce lytic enzymes (Amylase, Protease or Cellulase) and lipopeptides
(bacillomycin, fengycin, iturin and surfactin) was demonstrated by biochemical
and molecular analyzes. Therefore, our findings suggest that the bacterial
antagonists ACBC1, SF14, SP10 and ACBP1, have the potential to prevent brown rot 
disease.
