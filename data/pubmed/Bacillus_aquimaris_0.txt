AIMS: We investigated the potential cooperative effects of carotenoid-producing
Bacillus aquimaris SH6 and nonpigmented Bacillus subtilis SH23 on white-leg
shrimp growth and health.
METHODS AND RESULTS: SH6, SH23 and a combination of both spores (1 × 106  CFU per
g pellet) were administered in shrimp. The growth rate (2·36% day-1 ), red-colour
score (25) and astaxanthin concentration (3·5 µg g-1 shrimp) were maximum in
two-spore-administered shrimp. Immune-related Rho mRNA expression level and
phenoloxidase and superoxidase dismutase activities were higher in
two-spore-administered shrimp than in control shrimp, with Rho mRNA expression
level being 55-fold higher in two-spore-administered shrimp than in
SH6-administered shrimp and phenoloxidase activity being 1·2-fold higher in
two-spore-administered shrimp than in SH23-administered shrimp. Although live SH6
count was 2·7-fold lower, SH6 germination level was 3·5-fold higher in the
combination group than in SH6 group.
CONCLUSIONS: When both SH6 and SH23 spores were administered, SH6 spore
germination was enhanced and cooperative improvement was seen in growth,
astaxanthin level and red-colour score of white-leg shrimp; however,
immune-related parameters were induced in a noncooperative manner.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first report showing the
cooperative probiotic activities of Bacillus strains and their possible
mechanisms in a shrimp model.
