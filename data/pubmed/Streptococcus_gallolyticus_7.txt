Septic arthritis (SA) in an adult native joint is a rare condition but a
diagnostic emergency due to the morbidity and mortality and the functional risk
related to structural damage. Current management varies and the recommendations
available are dated. The French Rheumatology Society (SFR) Bone and Joint
Infection Working Group, together with the French Language Infectious Diseases
Society (SPILF) and the French Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery Society (SOFCOT)
have worked according to the HAS methodology to devise clinical practice
recommendations to diagnose and treat SA in an adult native joint. One new focus 
is on the importance of microbiological documentation (blood cultures and joint
aspiration) before starting antibiotic treatment, looking for differential
diagnoses (microcrystal detection), the relevance of a joint ultrasound to guide 
aspiration, and the indication to perform a reference X-ray. A cardiac ultrasound
is indicated only in cases of SA involving Staphylococcus aureus, oral
streptococci, Streptococcus gallolyticus or Enterococcus faecalis, or when
infective endocarditis is clinically suspected. Regarding treatment, we stress
the importance of medical and surgical collaboration. Antibiotic therapies (drugs
and durations) are presented in the form of didactic tables according to the main
bacteria in question (staphylococci, streptococci and gram-negative rods).
Probabilistic antibiotic therapy should only be used for patients with serious
symptoms. Lastly, non-drug treatments such as joint drainage and early physical
therapy are the subject of specific recommendations.
