We present a very rare case of concurrent empyema and liver abscess caused by
Fusobacterium. Our patient presented with 3-month history of subtle abdominal
discomfort and cough leading to eventually presenting with marked chest pain,
dyspnoea and septic shock. CT revealed a liver abscess and large right-sided
pleural effusion. Drainage of the pleural effusion yielded gross pus with the
growth of Fusobacterium varium, while drainage of the liver abscess yielded
Fusobacterium nucleatum The patient responded to drainage and antibiotic therapy 
with resolution of symptoms and decrease in the size of empyema and abscess on
follow-up imaging. We also include a review if literature of related
fusobacterial infections.
