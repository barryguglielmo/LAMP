Six commercial biocontrol agents (BCAs, containing Aureobasidium pullulans,
Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens plantarum, Bacillus
subtilis, Pythium oligandrum, or Trichoderma atroviride) were applied to ripening
berries that were then incubated at one of four temperatures (T, 15, 20, 25, and 
30°C) and one of four relative humidity levels (RH, 60, 80, 90, and 100%). After 
1 to 13 days of incubation (BCA colonization period), the berries were inoculated
with conidia of Botrytis cinerea and kept at 25°C and 100% RH for 7 days, at
which time Botrytis bunch rot (BBR) was assessed. The response of BBR control to 
T/RH conditions and BCA colonization period differed among BCAs; the coefficients
of variation among the BCAs ranged from 44.7 to 72.4%. An equation was developed 
that accounted for the combined effects of T, RH, and BCA colonization period on 
BBR control. The equation, which had an R2>0.94, could help farmers select the
BCA to be used for a specific application based on weather conditions at the time
of treatment and in the following days.
