The purpose of this study was to investigate the composition of throat microbiota
in pulmonary tuberculosis patients (PTB) in comparison to healthy tuberculin skin
test positive (TSTp) and negative (TSTn) individuals. Throat swabs samples were
collected, and the microbiota was characterized. Richer operational taxonomic
units (OTUs) were present in PTB group, compared to TSTp and TSTn. Regarding
alpha diversity analysis there was a higher community diversity in TSTn compared 
to TSTp. Beta diversity analysis showed different species composition in TSTp
compared to TSTn and PTB. There was higher presence of Firmicutes in PTB and TSTn
compared to TSTp group at phylum level. At the genus level, Leuconostoc and
Enterococcus were higher in TSTn compared to TSTp and Pediococcus,
Chryseobacterium, Bifidobacterium, Butyrivibrio, and Bulleidia were higher in PTB
compared to TSTn. Streptococcus was higher in TSTn compared to PTB and
Lactobacillus in PTB compared to TSTp. At species level, Streptococcus sobrinus
and Bulleidia moorei were higher in PTB compared to TSTn individuals, while
Lactobacillus salivarius was higher in PTB compared to TSTp. The differences in
the microbiome composition could influence the resistance/susceptibility to Mtb
infection.
