A dynamic model to predict the germination and outgrowth of Clostridium botulinum
spores in cooked ground beef was presented. Raw ground beef was inoculated with a
ten-strain C. botulinum spore cocktail to achieve approximately 2 log spores/g.
The inoculated ground beef was vacuum packaged, cooked to 71 °C to heat shock the
spores, cooled to below 10 °C, and incubated isothermally at temperatures from 10
to 46 °C. C. botulinum growth was quantified and fitted into the primary Baranyi 
Model. Secondary models were fitted to maximum specific growth rate and lag phase
duration using Modified Ratkowsky equation (R2 0.96) and hyperbolic function (R2 
0.94), respectively. Similar experiments were also performed under non-isothermal
(cooling) conditions. Acceptable zone prediction (APZ) analysis was conducted on 
growth data collected over 3 linear cooling regimes from the current study. The
model performance (prediction errors) for all 22 validation data points collected
in the current work were within the APZ limits (-1.0 to +0.5 log CFU/g).
Additionally, two other growth data sets of C. botulinum reported in the
literature were also subjected to the APZ analysis. In these validations, 20/22
and 10/14 predictions fell within the APZ limits. The model presented in this
work can be employed to predict C. botulinum spore germination and growth in
cooked uncured beef under non-isothermal conditions. The beef industry processors
and food service organizations can utilize this predictive microbial model for
cooling deviations and temperature abused situations and in developing customized
process schedules for cooked, uncured beef products.
