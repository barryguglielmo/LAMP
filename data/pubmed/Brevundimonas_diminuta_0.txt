The COVID-19 pandemic threatens to overwhelm healthcare systems around the world.
The only current FDA-approved treatment, which directly targets the virus, is the
ProTide prodrug remdesivir. In its activated form, remdesivir prevents viral
replication by inhibiting the essential RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Like other 
ProTide prodrugs, remdesivir contains a chiral phosphorus center. The initial
selection of the (SP)-diastereomer for remdesivir was reportedly due to the
difficulty in producing the pure (RP)-diastereomer of the required precursor.
However, the two currently known enzymes responsible for the initial activation
step of remdesivir are each stereoselective and show differential tissue
distribution. Given the ability of the COVID-19 virus to infect a wide array of
tissue types, inclusion of the (RP)-diastereomer may be of clinical significance.
To help overcome the challenge of obtaining the pure (RP)-diastereomer of
remdesivir, we have developed a novel chemoenzymatic strategy that utilizes a
stereoselective variant of the phosphotriesterase from Pseudomonas diminuta to
enable the facile isolation of the pure (RP)-diastereomer of the chiral precursor
for the chemical synthesis of the (RP)-diastereomer of remdesivir.
