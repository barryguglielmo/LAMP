Fecal IgA production depends on colonization by a gut microbiota. However, the
bacterial strains that drive gut IgA production remain largely unknown. Here, we 
assessed the IgA-inducing capacity of a diverse set of human gut microbial
strains by monocolonizing mice with each strain. We identified Bacteroides ovatus
as the species that best induced gut IgA production. However, this induction
varied bimodally across different B. ovatus strains. The high IgA-inducing
B. ovatus strains preferentially elicited more IgA production in the large
intestine through the T cell-dependent B cell-activation pathway. Remarkably, a
low-IgA phenotype in mice could be robustly and consistently converted into a
high-IgA phenotype by transplanting a multiplex cocktail of high IgA-inducing
B. ovatus strains but not individual ones. Our results highlight the critical
importance of microbial strains in driving phenotype variation in the mucosal
immune system and provide a strategy to robustly modify a gut immune phenotype,
including IgA production.
