Postinfectious hydrocephalus (PIH), which often follows neonatal sepsis, is the
most common cause of pediatric hydrocephalus worldwide, yet the microbial
pathogens underlying this disease remain to be elucidated. Characterization of
the microbial agents causing PIH would enable a shift from surgical palliation of
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) accumulation to prevention of the disease. Here, we
examined blood and CSF samples collected from 100 consecutive infant cases of PIH
and control cases comprising infants with non-postinfectious hydrocephalus in
Uganda. Genomic sequencing of samples was undertaken to test for bacterial,
fungal, and parasitic DNA; DNA and RNA sequencing was used to identify viruses;
and bacterial culture recovery was used to identify potential causative
organisms. We found that infection with the bacterium Paenibacillus, together
with frequent cytomegalovirus (CMV) coinfection, was associated with PIH in our
infant cohort. Assembly of the genome of a facultative anaerobic bacterial
isolate recovered from cultures of CSF samples from PIH cases identified a strain
of Paenibacillus thiaminolyticus This strain, designated Mbale, was lethal when
injected into mice in contrast to the benign reference Paenibacillus strain.
These findings show that an unbiased pan-microbial approach enabled
characterization of Paenibacillus in CSF samples from PIH cases, and point toward
a pathway of more optimal treatment and prevention for PIH and other proximate
neonatal infections.
