The purpose of this study was to investigate the composition of leaf extracts
from Aronia melanocarpa, Chaenomeles superba, and Cornus mas, and their
antimicrobial activity against typical spoilage-causing and pathogenic bacteria
found in meat and meat products. The highest total phenolic content (TPC) was
detected in C. superba extract, followed by C. mas and A. melanocarpa extracts.
The antioxidant capacity of the extracts was measured by DPPH and ABTS assays.
The lowest IC50 values were found for C. superba extract, followed by C. mas and 
A. melanocarpa extracts. LC-MS and HPLC analysis revealed that A. melanocarpa and
C. superba extracts contained hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives and flavonoids
(mainly flavonols). Hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives were detected in the C. mas 
extract, as well as flavonols, ellagitannins, and iridoids. The antibacterial
activity of the plant extracts was tested against Gram-negative bacteria
(Moraxella osloensis, Pseudomonas fragi, Acinetobacter baumanii, Escherichia
coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella enterica) and Gram-positive bacteria
(Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Brochothrix thermosphacta,
Lactobacillus sakei, Listeria monocytogenes) using the microculture method. The
extracts acted as bacteriostatic agents, decreasing the growth rate (µmax) and
extending the lag phase (tlag). C. mas showed most potent antibacterial activity,
as confirmed by principal component analysis (PCA).
