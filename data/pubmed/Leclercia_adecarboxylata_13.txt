Chromium (Cr) is becoming a potential pollutant with the passage of time. Higher 
intake of Cr does not only affect the productivity of crops, but also the quality
of food produced in Cr polluted soils. In the past, foliar application of Fe is
widely studied regarding their potential to alleviate Cr toxicity. However,
limited information is documented regarding the combined use of PGPR and foliar
Fe. Therefore, the current study was conducted to screen Cr tolerant PGPR and
examine effect of foliar Fe with and without Cr tolerant PGPR under Cr toxicity
(50 and 100 mg kg-1) in maize (Zea mays) production. Out of 15, two Cr tolerant
PGPR were screened, identified (Agrobacterium fabrum and Leclercia
adecarboxylata) and inoculated with 500 μM Fe. Results confirmed that
Agrobacterium fabrum + 500 μM Fe performed significantly best in improving dry
weight of roots and shoot, plant height, roots and shoot length and plant leaves 
in maize under Cr toxicity. A significant increase in chlorophyll a (51.5%), b
(55.1%) and total (32.5%) validated the effectiveness of A. fabrum + 500 μM Fe to
alleviate Cr toxicity. Improvement in intake of N (64.7%), P (70.0 and 183.3%), K
(53.8% and 3.40-fold) in leaves and N (25.6 and 122.2%), P (25.6 and 122.2%), K
(33.3% and 97.3%) in roots of maize at Cr50 and Cr100 confirmed that combined
application of A. fabrum with 500 μM Fe is a more efficacious approach for
alleviation of Cr toxicity and fortification of Fe comparative to sole foliar
application of 500 μM Fe.
