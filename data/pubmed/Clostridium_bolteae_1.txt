The gut pathogen Clostridium bolteae has been associated with the onset of autism
spectrum disorder (ASD). To create vaccines against C. bolteae, it is important
to identify exact protective epitopes of the immunologically active capsular
polysaccharide (CPS). Here, a series of C. bolteae CPS glycans, up to an
octadecasaccharide, was prepared. Key to achieving the total syntheses is a [2+2]
coupling strategy based on a β-d-Rhap-(1→3)-α-d-Manp repeating unit that in turn 
was accessed by a stereoselective β-d-rhamnosylation. The
4,6-O-benzylidene-induced conformational locking is a powerful strategy for
forming a β-d-mannose-type glycoside. An indirect strategy based on C2
epimerization of β-d-quinovoside was efficiently achieved by Swern oxidation and 
borohydride reduction. Sequential glycosylation, and regioselective and global
deprotection produced the disaccharide and tetrasaccharide, up to the
octadecasaccharide. Glycan microarray analysis of sera from rabbits immunized
with inactivated C. bolteae bacteria revealed a humoral immune response to the
di- and tetrasaccharide, but none of the longer sequences. The tetrasaccharide
may be a key motif for designing glycoconjugate vaccines against C. bolteae.
