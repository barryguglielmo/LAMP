A wild strain Bacillus amyloliquefaciens 205 was screened for its high activity
of α-amylase. A mesophilic α-amylase encoding gene amyE-205 was revealed and
analyzed by genome sequencing. In order to facilitate plasmid transformation to
strain 205, an interspecific plasmid transformation method was improved with 5-13
times higher in transformants than that of electronic transformation. A series of
CRISPR genome editing tools have been successfully constructed for gene knockout,
transcript repression and activation in 205 genome. At this basis, sporulation
related genes spo0A and spoIIAC were knockout and suppressed with CRISPR/Cas9 and
CRISPR/dCas9 respectively. The double knockout strain 205spo- was eliminated
sporulation with 22.8% increasing of α-amylase activity. The optimal binding site
G8 for dCas9-ω has been confirmed in the transcript activation. When amyE-205 was
over-expressed with high copy plasmid pUC980-2, its whole upstream sequences
containing G8 were also cloned. Whereafter, dCas9-ω was used to activate amyE-205
expression both at genome and plasmid. The final engineered strain 205PG8spo-
achieved 784.3% promotion on α-amylase activity than the starting strain 205. The
novel genetic tool box containing an efficient interspecific transformation
method and functional CRISPR systems, superadded the multiplex regulation
strategies used in strain modification would be also applicative in many Bacillus
species.
