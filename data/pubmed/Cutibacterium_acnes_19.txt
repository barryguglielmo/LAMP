STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of bacterial infection, with the use of a
contaminant control, in patients undergoing anterior cervical discectomy and
fusion (ACDF).
METHODS: After institutional review board approval, patients undergoing elective 
ACDF were prospectively enrolled. Samples of the longus colli muscle and disc
tissue were obtained. The tissue was then homogenized, gram stained, and cultured
in both aerobic and anaerobic medium. Patients were classified into 4 groups
depending on culture results. Demographic, preoperative, and postoperative
factors were evaluated.
RESULTS: Ninety-six patients were enrolled, 41.7% were males with an average age 
of 54 ± 11 years and a body mass index of 29.7 ± 5.9 kg/m2. Seventeen patients
(17.7%) were considered true positives, having a negative control and positive
disc culture. Otherwise, no significant differences in culture positivity was
found between groups of patients. However, our results show that patients were
more likely to have both control and disc negative than being a true positive
(odds ratio = 6.2, 95% confidence interval = 2.5-14.6). Propionibacterium acnes
was the most commonly identified bacteria. Two patients with disc positive
cultures returned to the operating room secondary to pseudarthrosis; however,
age, body mass index, prior spine surgery or injection, postoperative infection, 
and reoperations were not associated with culture results.
CONCLUSION: In our cohort, the prevalence of subclinical bacterial infection in
patients undergoing ACDF was 17.7%. While our rates exclude patients with
positive contaminant control, the possibility of contamination of disc cultures
could not be entirely rejected. Overall, culture results did not have any
influence on postoperative outcomes.
