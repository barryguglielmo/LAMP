Information about bacterial diversity, such as the number of each species in the 
root canals of primary teeth, contributes to improving our effective management
of infections of endodontic origin in primary teeth. This study made a
qualitative and quantitative assessment of the bacteria in the root canals of
primary teeth with necrotic pulp, using the fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) technique. Thirty-one primary teeth with pulp necrosis from 31 children
were evaluated using the FISH technique, to detect the presence and density of
Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter rectus, Enterococcus
faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella
intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Streptococcus, Streptococcus mutans,
Streptococcus sobrinus, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola. Descriptive
measures explained the data related to density, and Student's t-test assessed the
differences among the densities of each bacterium, according to signs and
symptoms. The bacterial density was paired and correlated. All bacteria tested
were detected and identified in all the samples. The average number of bacterial 
individuals from each species ranged from 1.9 x 108 cells/mL (S. mutans) to 3.1 x
108 cells/mL (F. nucleatum) (p > 0.05). The sum of the mean counts of each
bacterium represented almost 80% of the entire microbial community. Patients with
pain had significantly more T. denticola, and those with edema showed a greater
density of Streptococcus and P. nigrescens (p < 0.05). This study revealed that
all 12 bacteria evaluated were found in all primary teeth with pulp necrosis.
There was no predominance among the species studied; all species had a similar
number of individuals.
