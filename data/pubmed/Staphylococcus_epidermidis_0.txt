OBJECTIVES: To synthesize and characterize the inclusion complexes of fusidic
acid with β - cyclodextrin, followed by the evaluation of their antimicrobial
activity against pure stain (staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923) and against
isolated staphylococcus from clinical cases.
METHODS: The desired compounds were synthesized using a molar ratio of fusidic
acid: β-cyclodextrin of 1:1. Synthesized compounds were analyzed by Fourier
transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), XRay Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron
Microscopy (SEM) and also Thermal Analysis and the results confirmed the
formation of inclusion compounds by fusidic acid with β-cyclodextrin.
RESULTS: Physical - chemical characterization confirmed the preparation of
desired inclusion compounds, and the antimicrobial test confirmed that all
compounds obtained have antimicrobial activity. Antimicrobial activity of freeze 
drying complex against Staphilococcus aureus is similar with pure fusidic acid
activity, being better than cefoxitin one. Similar behavior being observed
against methicillin resistant sthapylococcus aureus, and sthaphilococcus
epidermidis.
CONCLUSIONS: In present work three different inclusion complexes of fusidic acid 
were prepared by using three different preparation methods. All inclusion
complexes obtained represented good antimicrobial activity against different
staphylococcus aureus stains. Antimicrobial activity of these new prepared
compounds was observed to be better than the one of cefoxitin.
