The purpose of this study was to evaluate the probiotic characteristics and
neuroprotective effects of bacteria isolated from Korean fermented foods. Three
bacterial strains (Lactobacillus fermentum KU200060, Lactobacillus delbrueckii
KU200171, and Lactobacillus buchneri KU200793) showed potential probiotic
properties, such as high tolerance against artificial gastric juice and bile
salts, sensitivity to antibiotics, nonproduction of carcinogenic enzymes, and
high adhesion to intestinal cells. Heat-killed L. fermentum KU200060 and L.
buchneri KU200793 showed higher antioxidant activity than heat-killed L.
delbrueckii KU200171. The conditioned medium (CM) was used to evaluate the
reaction between HT-29 cells and each heat-killed strain. All CMs protected
SH-SY5Y cells from 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-induced toxicity. The
expression of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) mRNA in HT-29 cells treated
with CM containing heat-killed L. buchneri KU200793 was the highest. The CM
significantly reduced the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and increased BDNF mRNA expression in
SH-SY5Y cells treated with MPP+. These results indicate that L. buchneri KU200793
can be used as a prophylactic functional food, having probiotic potential and
neuroprotective effects.
