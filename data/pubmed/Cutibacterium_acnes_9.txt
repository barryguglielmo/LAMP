Our understanding of the role of Cutibacterium acnes in the pathophysiology of
acne has recently undergone a paradigm shift: rather than C. acnes
hyperproliferation, it is the loss of balance between the different C. acnes
phylotypes, together with a dysbiosis of the skin microbiome, which results in
acne development. The loss of diversity of C. acnes phylotypes acts as a trigger 
for innate immune system activation, leading to cutaneous inflammation. A
predominance of C. acnes phylotype IA1 has been observed, with a more virulent
profile in acne than in normal skin. Other bacteria, mainly Staphylococcus
epidermis, are also implicated in acne. S. epidermidis and C. acnes interact and 
are critical for the regulation of skin homeostasis. Recent studies also showed
that the gut microbiome is involved in acne, through interactions with the skin
microbiome. As commonly used topical and systemic antibiotics induce cutaneous
dysbiosis, our new understanding of acne pathophysiology has prompted a change in
direction for acne treatment. In the future, the development of individualized
acne therapies will allow targeting of the pathogenic strains, leaving the
commensal strains intact. Such alternative treatments, involving modifications of
the microbiome, will form the next generation of 'ecobiological'
anti-inflammatory treatments.
