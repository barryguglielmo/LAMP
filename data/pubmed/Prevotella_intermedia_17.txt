Several cohort studies have shown that periodontal disease is associated with an 
increased risk for stroke. However, it remains unclear whether serum antibody
titers for a specific periodontal pathogen are associated with outcome after
ischemic stroke, and which kinds of pathogens are associated with ischemic
stroke. We examined the relationship between serum IgG titers to periodontal
pathogens and outcome in ischemic stroke patients. A total of 445 patients with
acute ischemic stroke (194 female [44.0%], mean age 71.9Â±12.3 years) were
registered in this study. Serum IgG titers to 9 periodontal pathogens
(Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella
intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema denticola, 
Tannerella forsythensis, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens) were
evaluated using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. An
unfavorable outcome was defined as a 3 or higher on the modified Rankin Scale.
The proportion of patients with unfavorable outcome was 25.4% (113 patients).
Based on multivariate logistic regression analysis, numbers of IgG antibodies
positive for periodontal pathogens (odds ratio 1.20, 95% CI 1.02-1.41, p = 0.03) 
were independent predictors of unfavorable outcome in ischemic stroke patients.
