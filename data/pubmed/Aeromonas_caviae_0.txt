The presented data provide new information on antibiotic resistance and virulence
genes in the genomes of Aeromonas caviae strains TW-2 and TW-6, isolated from
treated wastewater. The results confirm the presence of
multi-antibiotic-resistant Aeromonas caviae strains with virulence properties as 
"high-risk isolates" in treated wastewater.
