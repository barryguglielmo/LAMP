Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (S. maltophilia) is a common opportunistic pathogen 
in intensive care units and causes infections most often after surgeries in
immune-compromised patients such as those undergoing chemotherapy. Outer membrane
protein A (OmpA) is the most abundant of the outer membrane proteins in S.
maltophilia. Previous studies on OmpA usually focus on its interaction with the
host cells and its role in vaccine development. However, the impact of OmpA on
the virulence of S. maltophilia to host cells and the effects on apoptosis remain
unclear. In this study, we exposed purified recombinant S. maltophilia OmpA
(rOmpA) to HEp-2 cells and investigated the effects of OmpA on epithelial cell
apoptosis. Morphologic and flow cytometric analyses revealed that HEp-2 cells
stimulated with rOmpA multiple apoptosis features, including nuclear roundness
and pyknosis, chromatin aggregation, and phosphatidylserine eversion. We found
that rOmpA regulated the protein levels of Bax and Bcl-xL in HEp-2 cells, leading
to changes in mitochondria permeability and the release of cytochrome c and
apoptosis-inducing factors into the cytoplasm. These subsequently activate the
caspase-9/caspase-3 pathway that promote apoptosis. We also observed that rOmpA
enhanced the generation of reactive oxygen species and increased intracellular
Ca2+ levels in HEp-2 cells. Collectively, our data suggested that rOmpA induced
epithelial cells apoptosis via mi-tochondrial pathways.
