Awa-bancha is a post-fermented tea produced in Naka and Kamikatsu, Tokushima,
Japan. We investigated the lactic acid bacteria in each stage of production of
Awa-bancha and evaluated the relationships with the components. Lactic acid
bacteria were isolated from tea leaves cultured with de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe
(MRS) agar plates, and the species were identified by homology of the 16Â S rRNA
gene and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the recA gene to
distinguish the Lactobacillus plantarum group. As a result, a variety of species 
were isolated from the raw tea leaves, and Lactobacillus pentosus was isolated
most frequently after anaerobic fermentation. Regarding the tea leaf components, 
organic acids, such as lactic acid, increased, free amino acids decreased, and
catechins changed owing to anaerobic fermentation. Our results suggest that the
microbial flora mainly composed of L. pentosus is important in the anaerobic
fermentation process for flavor formation of Awa-bancha.
