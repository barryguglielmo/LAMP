A Gram-stain-positive anaerobic rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain
Marseille-P3275T, was isolated using culturomics from the vaginal discharge of
healthy French woman. Marseille-P3275T was non-motile and did not form spores.
Cells had neither catalase nor oxidase activity. The major fatty acids were
C16 : 0 (29 %), C18:1ω9 (18 %), and iso-C15 : 0 (17 %). The genomic DNA G+C
content was 50.64 mol%. The phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence
indicated that Marseille-P3275T was related to members of the family
Propionibacteriaceae (between 90.32-92.92 % sequence similarity) with formation
of a clade with the monospecific genus Propionimicrobium (type species
Propionimicrobium lymphophilum). On the basis of these phylogenetic and
phenotypic differences, Marseille-P3275T was classified in a novel genus,
Vaginimicrobium, as Vaginimicrobium propionicum gen. nov., sp. nov. The type
strain is Marseille-P3275T (=CSUR P3275T=CECT 9677T).
