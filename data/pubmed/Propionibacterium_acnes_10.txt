PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the incidence and risk factors of
endophthalmitis after transconjunctival pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) without
intraoperative subconjunctival antibiotics.
DESIGN: Retrospective, consecutive case series at a single institution.
METHODS: Consecutive cases of transconjunctival 25-gauge PPV without
intraoperative subconjunctival antibiotics performed by three retina surgeons at 
a single surgical site at the Dean McGee Eye Institute from 2012 to 2018 were
reviewed.
RESULTS: Of 4,263 cases of PPV without intraoperative subconjunctival
antibiotics, five cases (0.117%, 5/4,263) of post-PPV endophthalmitis were
identified. Of these five cases, four cases (80%, 4/5) received combined cataract
extraction or secondary intraocular lens implantation at the time of PPV. The
incidence of endophthalmitis in isolated PPV was 0.027% (1/3,606 cases), whereas 
the incidence in combined PPV with anterior segment procedures was 0.608% (4/657 
cases). Risk factors for endophthalmitis included diabetes mellitus, which was
present in 80% of patients with endophthalmitis (4/5 cases). Causative organisms 
were identified in four of the five cases (80%), including Staphylococcus
epidermidis (N = 3) and Propionibacterium acnes (N = 1).
CONCLUSION: Performing transconjunctival PPV alone with standard preparation
using povidone-iodine and postoperative topical antibiotics for 1 week without
intraoperative subconjunctival antibiotics did not lead to an increase in
incidence of postoperative endophthalmitis (1 per 3,606 cases).
