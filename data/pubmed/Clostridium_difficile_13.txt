BACKGROUND: Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile is an important pathogen of
healthcare- associated diarrhea, however, an increase in the occurrence of C.
difficile infection (CDI) outside hospital settings has been reported. The
accumulation of antimicrobial resistance in C. difficile can increase the risk of
CDI development and/or its spread. The limited number of antimicrobials for the
treatment of CDI is matter of some concern.
OBJECTIVES: In order to summarize the data on antimicrobial resistance to C.
difficile derived from humans, a systematic review and meta-analysis were
performed.
METHODS: We searched five bibliographic databases: (MEDLINE [PubMed], Scopus,
Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science) for studies that focused on
antimicrobial susceptibility testing in C. difficile and were published between
1992 and 2019. The weighted pooled resistance (WPR) for each antimicrobial agent 
was calculated using a random- effects model.
RESULTS: A total of 111 studies were included. The WPR for metronidazole and
vancomycin was 1.0% (95% CI 0-3%) and 1% (95% CI 0-2%) for the breakpoint
> 2 mg/L and 0% (95% CI 0%) for breakpoint ≥32 μg/ml. Rifampin and tigecycline
had a WPRs of 37.0% (95% CI 18-58%) and 1% (95% CI 0-3%), respectively. The WPRs 
for the other antimicrobials were as follows: ciprofloxacin 95% (95% CI 85-100%),
moxifloxacin 32% (95% CI 25-40%), clindamycin 59% (95% CI 53-65%),
amoxicillin/clavulanate 0% (0-0%), piperacillin/tazobactam 0% (0-0%) and
ceftriaxone 47% (95% CI 29-65%). Tetracycline had a WPR 20% (95% CI 14-27%) and
meropenem showed 0% (95% CI 0-1%); resistance to fidaxomicin was reported in one 
isolate (0.08%).
CONCLUSION: Resistance to metronidazole, vancomycin, fidaxomicin, meropenem and
piperacillin/tazobactam is reported rarely. From the alternative CDI drug
treatments, tigecycline had a lower resistance rate than rifampin. The high-risk 
antimicrobials for CDI development showed a high level of resistance, the highest
was seen in the second generation of fluoroquinolones and clindamycin;
amoxicillin/clavulanate showed almost no resistance. Tetracycline resistance was 
present in one fifth of human clinical C. difficile isolates.
