Wastewater containing high concentrations of nitriles, if discharged without an
appropriate nonhazardous disposal strategy, will cause serious environmental
pollution. During secondary sewage biological treatment, most existing bacteria
cannot endure high-concentration nitriles due to poor tolerance and low
degradation ability. The Rhodococcus rhodochrous strain BX2 screened by our
laboratory shows high resistance to nitriles and can efficiently degrade these
compounds. Compared with sole high-concentration nitriles present in the
biodegradation process, the addition of glucose at a suitable concentration can
effectively increase the biomass of BX2, promote the expression of
nitrile-degrading enzyme genes, improve the activities of these enzymes and
enhance the pollutant removal efficiency via carbon catabolite repression (CCR)
mechanisms. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that the four key regulators of CCR 
identified in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria are concomitant in BX2.
This study provides an economically feasible strategy for the microbial
remediation of high-concentration nitriles and other organic pollutants.
