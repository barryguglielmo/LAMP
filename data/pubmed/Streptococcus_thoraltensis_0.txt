BACKGROUND: Misuse of antibiotics in veterinary medicine has the potential to
generate residues in animal derived products, which could contributing to the
development of an important health risk either through the exposure to antibiotic
residues or the transfer of antibiotic resistance among foodborne pathogens as
well. Tetracycline (TE) and eptomycin (ST) are commonly used as antibiotics in
the Egyptian animal husbandry. The objective of this study, quick detection of TE
and ST in fresh local beef tissue samples using radioimmunoassay Charm II
technique, isolation and identification of relevant highly resistant bacterial
strains. In addition to investigating the effect of gamma radiation on the
susceptibility of such resistant strains to TE and ST.
RESULTS: Tetracycline (TE) was detected in all collected samples, while ST was
detected in 38.46% (5/13) and 87.5% (7/8) of meat and liver samples,
respectively. Fifty-one bacterial isolates were isolated from the tested samples,
among them, the highest resistant isolates to TE or ST were identified as
Streptococcus thoraltensis, Proteus mirabilis (2 isolates) and E. coli (3
isolates). Among them, the highest D10-values in phosphate buffer; 0.807 and
0.480; kGy were recorded with S. thoraltensis and E. coli no.3, respectively.
Such values increased to record 0.840 and 0.549 kGy, respectively after
artificial inoculation into meat, indicating increased resistance to gamma
radiation. Gamma radiation at dose 3 kGy increased the susceptibility of S.
thoraltensis up to 50% to TE and ST, while the sensitivity of E. coli no.3
reached up 56% to both antibiotics at the same dose.
CONCLUSIONS: High prevalence of TE in all fresh collected tissue samples suggests
an extensively use of TE as antimicrobial in conventional beef production as
compared to ST in the Egyptian cows' husbandry. Moreover, irradiation of food
from animal origin by gamma radiation could potentially provide protection
against resistant strains. In spite of limited samples used in this study, our
data could raise the concerns of public health professionals about a withdrawal
period before animals slaughtering, and address the importance of gamma radiation
to minimize the hazards of foodborne resistant bacteria.
