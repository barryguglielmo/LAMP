A carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas synxantha isolate recovered from chicken meat 
produced the novel carbapenemase PFM-1. That subclass B2 metallo-β-lactamase
shared 71% amino acid identity with β-lactamase Sfh-1 from Serratia fonticola The
bla PFM-1 gene was chromosomally located and likely acquired. Variants of PFM-1
sharing 90% to 92% amino acid identity were identified in bacterial species
belonging to the Pseudomonas fluorescens complex, including Pseudomonas
libanensis (PFM-2) and Pseudomonas fluorescens (PFM-3), highlighting that these
species constitute reservoirs of PFM-like encoding genes.
