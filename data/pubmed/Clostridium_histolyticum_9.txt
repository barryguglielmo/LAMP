INTRODUCTION: Peyronie's disease (PD) is an inflammatory disorder of the tunica
albuginea causing fibrotic changes including abnormal penile curvature, pain, and
erectile dysfunction. Approximately 10% of PD patients will have atypical
features including ventral plaques, hourglass deformities, unilateral
indentations, severely shortened penile length, and multiplanar curvatures.
Currently, the only intralesional treatment approved by the United States Food
and Drug Administration is considered off-label for atypical PD. Furthermore,
treatment of atypical PD, especially ventral plaques, is met with hesitation, in 
part due to potential urethral injury.
OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the available literature for the safety and 
efficacy of intralesional injections for atypical PD.
METHODS: A thorough literature search of the PubMed database was performed on
manuscripts published between 1982 and 2020. Keywords included atypical
Peyronie's disease, ventral plaque, hourglass deformity, and injection.
RESULTS: 15 articles met the criteria for evaluation. Overall, 1,357 patients
with PD were treated with intralesional therapy, of which 250 patients were
considered to have an atypical presentation. 162 (648%) of the patients were
treated with intralesional collagenase Clostridium histolyticum, 49 (19.6%) with 
verapamil, 29 (11.6%) with interferon alfa-2b, 5 (2.0%) with hyaluronic acid, and
another 5 (2.0%) with onabotulinumtoxinA. There was only 1 reported severe
adverse event (penile fracture), which was surgically repaired. There were no
reports of urethral injury.
CONCLUSION: Intralesional injection treatment may be a safe alternative option
for atypical PD. There is a great need for future research to closely monitor the
role of intralesional therapy in this cohort. Choi EJ, Xu P, El-Khatib FM, et al.
