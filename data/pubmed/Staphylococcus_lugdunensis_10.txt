Symptoms of Staphylococcus lugdunensis infection are often similar to those of
Staphylococcus aureus infection, including skin and soft-tissue lesions,
bacteremia and infective endocarditis. Despite the severity of these infections, 
S. lugdunensis is regarded as a less important pathogen than drug-resistant S.
aureus. To investigate its ability to cause infectious diseases, a
methicillin-resistant S. lugdunensis (MRSL) strain JICS135 was isolated from a
patient with bacteremia and subjected to whole genome sequencing. Similar to most
strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), this MRSL strain possessed the
staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) located close to the origin of
replication. However, the SCCmec in this MRSL strain, with three ccr complexes,
was structurally unique and currently untypable. Moreover, the SCCmec of this
MRSL strain was found to carry two genes encoding microbial surface components
recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMM)-like proteins accompanied by
glycosyl transferases, one of which may have been derived from S. aureus and the 
other from S. epidermidis, indicating that this MRSL evolved to carry virulence
factors from other staphylococci. The emergence of this strain, the first MRSL
strain whose genome has been sequenced completely, may be of public concern.
