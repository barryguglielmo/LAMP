A virulence-encoding plasmid, p15WZ-82_Vir, which formed as a result of the
integration of a 100-kb fragment of the hypervirulence plasmid pLVPK into a
conjugative IncFIB plasmid, was recovered from a clinical Klebsiella variicola
strain. Such a plasmid could be conjugated to carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
strains, enabling them to simultaneously express the carbapenem resistance- and
hypervirulence-associated phenotypes. Unlike the non-conjugative pLVPK plasmid,
emergence of p15WZ-82_Vir may promote rapid dissemination of virulence-encoding
elements among Gram-negative bacterial pathogens.
