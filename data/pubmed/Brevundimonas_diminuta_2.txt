Supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) is a novel method for food pasteurization, 
but there is still room for improvement in terms of the process shortening and
its use in products with high oil content. This study addressed the effect of
high power ultrasound (HPU) on the intensification of the SC-CO2 inactivation of 
E. coli and B. diminuta in soybean oil-in-water emulsions. Inactivation kinetics 
were obtained at different pressures (100 and 350 bar), temperatures (35 and
50 °C) and oil contents (0, 10, 20 and 30%) and were satisfactorily described
using the Weibull model. The experimental results showed that for SC-CO2
treatments, the higher the pressure or the temperature, the higher the level of
inactivation. Ultrasound greatly intensified the inactivation capacity of SC-CO2,
shortening the process time by approximately 1 order of magnitude (from 50 to
90 min to 5-10 min depending on the microorganism and process conditions).
Pressure and temperature also had a significant (p < 0.05) effect on SC-CO2 + HPU
inactivation for both bacteria, although the effect was less intense than in the 
SC-CO2 treatments. E. coli was found to be more resistant than B. diminuta in
SC-CO2 treatments, while no differences were found when HPU was applied. HPU
decreased the protective effect of oil in the inactivation and similar microbial 
reductions were obtained regardless of the oil content in the emulsion.
Therefore, HPU intensification of SC-CO2 treatments is a promising alternative to
the thermal pasteurization of lipid emulsions with heat sensitive compounds.
