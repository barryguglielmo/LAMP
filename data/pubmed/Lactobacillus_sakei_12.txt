In this study, lactic acid bacteria strains (LABs) were isolated from Korean
traditional fermented food and examined as potential probiotics using in vitro
methods. Ten LAB strains survived in de Man, Rogosa and Sharpe broth adjusted to 
pH 2.5 were tested for resistance to acidic conditions and bile, antimicrobial
activity, and α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. Among them, strain MBEL1397
showed antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus and exhibited survival
rates of over 97% in acidic and bile conditions. The α-glucosidase inhibitory
activity was 3.91 ± 0.25%, corresponding to approximately 2.3 times higher than
that of acarbose. MBEL1397 was susceptible to ampicillin, erythromycin, and
penicillin G and identified as Lactobacillus sakei. It was deposited to Korean
Collection for Type Culture (KCTC) as KCTC14037BP. In conclusion, these results
demonstrate that L. sakei MBEL1397 might be prominent probiotics with potential
hypoglycemic effects.
