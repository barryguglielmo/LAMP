AIMS: The major aims of this study are to determine the capability of sulphur
oxidizing bacterium (SOB-1) to desulphurize dibenzothiophene (DBT) and crude oil,
detection of the reaction kinetics and identify the proposed pathway of DBT
desulphurization.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The isolate was genetically identified based on 16S rRNA
gene sequencing as Klebsiella oxytoca and deposited in the Genebank database
under the accession number: MT355440. The HPLC analysis of the remaining DBT
concentration revealed that, SOB-1 could desulphurize 90% of DBT (0·25 mmol l-1 )
within 96 h. The maximum production of sulphate ions from the desulphurization of
DBT (0·36 mmol l-1 ) and crude oil (0·4 mmol l-1 ) could be quantitatively
detected after 48 h of incubation at 30°C. The high values of correlation
coefficient (R2 ) obtained at all studied concentrations; suggested that
biodesulfurization kinetics of DBT follows the first-order reaction model. The
kinetics studies showed that, DBT may have an inhibitory effect on SOB-1 when the
initial concentration exceeded 0·75 mmol l-1 . The GC-MS analysis exhibited four 
main metabolites rather than DBT. The most important ones are 2-hydroxybiphenyl
(2-HBP) and methoxybiphenyl n(2-MBP).
CONCLUSIONS: Klebsiella oxytoca SOB-1 catalyzes the desulphurization of DBT
through 4S pathway and forms four main metabolic products. The release of
sulphate ion and formation of 2-HBP indicating the elimination of sulphur group
without altering the carbon skeleton of DBT. The bacterial strain could also
catalyzes desulphurization of crude oil. The desulphurization kinetics follows
the first-order reaction model.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Klebsiella oxytoca SOB-1 could be used as a
promising industrial and environmental biodesulfurizing agent as it is not
affecting carbon skeleton of thiophenic compounds and forming less toxic
metabolic product (2-MBP).
