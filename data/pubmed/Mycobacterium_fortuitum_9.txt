An iatrogenic injection abscess is usually easy to treat if caused by aerobic
bacteria but some rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM), namely, Mycobacterium
fortuitum, M. chelonae, and M. abscessus are associated with postinjection
abscess and may cause delayed wound healing. RGM can cause mild localized
cellulitis or abscess to osteomyelitis following penetration injuries or unsafe
injection practices. A 7-year-old girl was presented to pediatric surgery OPD
with abscess formation over the right buttock. Incision and drainage from abscess
were performed in OPD and pus sample was sent for aerobic bacterial culture and
sensitivity. On gram stain plenty of pus cells with no microorganism were seen
and growth on blood agar after 48 h of aerobic incubation at 37°C showed small
off-white pinpoint, smooth butyrous waxy colonies. Smear prepared from blood agar
showed uniformly stained short, slender, faintly stained gram-positive bacilli,
for which acid-fast staining (1% and 20% H2SO4) was performed that showed
acid-fast bacilli. The isolate was further identified by the molecular method and
was confirmed to be Mycobacterium fortuitum by genotype Mycobacterium CM VER 1.0
