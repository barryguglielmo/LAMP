Three new neoflavonoids, named
(1S,8R,9S)-1,5-dihydroxy-4,12-dimethoxy-8-vinyl-tricyclo[7.3.1.02,7]trideca-2,4,6
,11-tetraen-10-one (1), 2,5,2',5'-tetrahydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone (2) and
2,5,3'-trihydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone (3), were isolated from the heartwood of 
Dalbergia melanoxylon. Their structures were established by spectroscopic
methods, including UV, IR, HRMS, 1 D and 2 D-NMR. Compounds 1-3 were evaluated
for inhibitory activity against three fungal strains Candida albicans, Mucor
ramosissimus, Saccharomycopsis fermentans and seven bacterial strains Shigella
dysenteriae, Salmonella enteri, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis,
Bacillus sphaericus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli using the broth
dilution method. However, none of compounds 1-3 showed potential antimicrobial
activities in vitro.
