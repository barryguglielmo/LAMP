Neonatal sepsis is a bloodstream infection primarily caused by Escherichia coli
(E. coli), Group B Streptococcus (GBS), Listeria monocytogenes, Haemophilus
influenzae, S. aureus, Klebsiella spp. and non-typhoidal Salmonella bacteria.
Neonatal Sepsis is referred as a critical response to the infection in the
neonatal period that can lead to the failure of body organs and thereby causing
damage to the tissues resulting in death of the neonates. Nearly 4 million deaths
across the world are occurred due to neonatal sepsis infections. In order to
prevent the bloodstream infections in the neonates, it is indispensable to
diagnose the disease properly for appropriate treatment during the point of care.
Numerous studies have been reported to identify major biomarkers associated with 
neonatal sepsis including Serum Amyloid A (SAA), C - reactive protein (CRP),
Procalcitonin (PCT) and Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP). Distinct
diagnostic platforms have also been developed detecting the presence of
bloodstream infections including electrochemical, potentiometric, and
impedimetric sensors. Recently, electrochemical biosensors with the integration
of nanomaterials have emerged as a better platform for neonatal sepsis biomarkers
detection. This review article summarizes the diverse screening platforms,
evaluation parameters, and new advances based on implications of nanomaterials
for the development of biosensors detecting neonatal sepsis infections. The
review further elucidates the significance and future scope of distinctive
platforms which are predominantly associated with detection of neonatal sepsis.
