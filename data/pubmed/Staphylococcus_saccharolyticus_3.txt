Escherichia coli and salivary Klebsiella oxytoca and Staphylococcus
saccharolyticus were subjected to different concentrations of silver
nanoparticles (AgNPs), namely: 12.5, 50, and 100 µg mL-1. Matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) spectra
were acquired after specified periods: 0, 1, 4, and 12 h. For study of volatile
metabolites, headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled to gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) was employed-AgNPs were added to
bacteria cultures and the headspace was analyzed immediately and after 12 h of
incubation. Principal components analysis provided discrimination between
clusters of protein profiles belonging to different strains. Canonical
correlation, network analysis, and multiple linear regression approach revealed
that dimethyl disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, 2-heptanone, and dodecanal (related
to the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids and fatty acids synthesis) are
exemplary molecular indicators, whose response variation deeply correlated to the
interaction with bacteria. Therefore, such species can serve as biomarkers of the
agent's effectiveness. The present investigation pointed out that the used
approaches can be useful in the monitoring of response to therapeutic treatment
based on AgNPs. Furthermore, biochemical mechanisms enrolled in the bactericidal 
action of nanoparticles can be applied in the development of new agents with
enhanced properties.
