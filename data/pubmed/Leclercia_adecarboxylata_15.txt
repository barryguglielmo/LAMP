Microbial arsenic transformation is important in As biogeochemical cycles in the 
environment. In this study, a new As-resistant bacterial strain Leclercia
adecarboxylata As3-1 was isolated and its associated mechanisms in As resistance 
and detoxification were evaluated based on genome sequencing and gene
annotations. After subjecting strain As3-1 to medium containing arsenate (AsV),
AsV reduction occurred and an AsV-enhanced bacterial growth was observed. Strain 
As3-1 lacked arsenite (AsIII) oxidation ability and displayed lower AsIII
resistance than AsV, probably due to its higher AsIII accumulation. Polymerase
chain reaction and phylogenetic analysis showed that strain As3-1 harbored a
typical AsV reductase gene (arsC) on the plasmids. Genome sequencing and gene
annotations identified four operons phoUpstBACS, arsHRBC, arsCRDABC and ttrRSBCA,
with 8 additional genes outside the operons that might have involved in As
resistance and detoxification in strain As3-1. These included 5 arsC genes
explaining why strain As3-1 tolerated high AsV concentrations. Besides ArsC,
TtrB, TtrC and TtrA proteins could also be involved in AsV reduction and
consequent energy acquisition for bacterial growth. Our data provided a new
example of diverse As-regulating systems and AsV-enhanced growth without ArrA in 
bacteria. The information helps to understand the role of As in selecting
microbial systems that can transform and utilize As.
