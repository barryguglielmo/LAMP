Lactobacillus fermentum KU200060 was isolated from watery kimchi and its
probiotic characteristics were evaluated, including tolerance to artificial
gastric acid and bile salt, production of enzymes, ability to adhere to
HT-29 cells, and antibiotic susceptibility. The antibacterial and antibiofilm
effects of L. fermentum KU200060 against Streptococcus mutans KCTC 5316 were
compared to those of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactobacillus brevis KU15006.
L. fermentum KU200060 demonstrated higher antibacterial activity and inhibition
of biofilm formation by S. mutans than L. rhamnosus GG via inhibiting formation
of water-insoluble glucan and related gene expression. In addition, L. fermentum 
KU200060 was applied as a probiotic in yogurt, and its physicochemical property
and sensory value demonstrated its potential as a yogurt starter. The
physicochemical characteristics and consumer acceptability of the probiotic
yogurt containing L. fermentum KU200060 were not significantly different compared
to those of the control yogurt. Therefore, L. fermentum KU200060 could be used
for oral health in the probiotic industry.
