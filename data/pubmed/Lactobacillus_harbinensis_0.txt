Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are commonly used in soymilk fermentation to improve
health-related functionality, but their contribution to sensory qualities is less
valued. We characterized Lactobacillus harbinensis M1, Lactobacillus mucosae M2, 
Lactobacillus fermentum M4, Lactobacillus casei M8 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus C1
from naturally-fermented tofu whey, along with Streptococcus thermophilus ST3
from kefir XPL-1 fermented soymilk, to investigate their potential as starter
cultures of fermented soymilk. They were characterized for antibiotic
susceptibility, probiotic potential and their performance as starter cultures.
All the LABs showed sensitivity to the tested antibiotics. L. casei M8 had
strongest tolerance to synthetic gastrointestinal juice (<1.0 log CFU/mL loss),
as well as antagonistic effects towards five food-borne pathogens. GC/MS analysis
showed that L. harbinensis M1 produced significantly higher abundance (P < 0.05) 
of 2,3-butanedione (2.45 ppm) and acetoin (44.30 ppm), thus improving the overall
sensory acceptability of fermented soymilk. The coding genes for the synthesis of
2,3-butanedione/acetoin (alsS, alsD, butA) were predicted from the whole-genome. 
A co-culture of L. harbinensis M1 and L. casei M8 produced a fermented soymilk
product with both markedly improved flavor and good probiotic potential. It
appears that L. harbinensis M1 has much potential for improving the organoleptic 
properties of fermented soymilk.
