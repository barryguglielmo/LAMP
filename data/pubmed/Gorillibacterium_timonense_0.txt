A Gram-negative and facultative anaerobic bacterium, designated strain SN4T, was 
isolated from the stool sample of an obese Amazonian patient. The new isolate was
characterized by the taxonogenomics approach. The strain SN4T was beige-colored, 
circular and not haemolytic. Cells are rod shaped and motile with several
flagella. Strain SN4T grows optimally at pH 7 and can survive in the presence of 
a saline concentration of up to 75 g/l NaCl. The 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence 
analysis of the novel strain SN4T showed 95.28% similarity in nucleotide sequence
with Gorillibacterium massiliense G5T, the phylogenetically closest neighbor and 
the type species of this genus. Anteiso-C15:0, iso-C15:0 and C16:0 were found as 
the major components in the cellular fatty acid analysis of this isolate. The
genomic draft of strain SN4T is 5,263,742 bp long with 53.33% of G+C content. The
differences in physiological, biochemical characteristics and phylogenetic and
genomic data make it possible to clearly distinguish the strain SN4T from G.
massiliense G5T. Based on the taxonogenomic description and the phenotypic and
biochemical characteristics of this bacterium presented in this article, we
propose the SN4T strain (= CSUR P2011 = DSM 100,698) as a new species,
Gorillibacterium timonense sp. nov.
