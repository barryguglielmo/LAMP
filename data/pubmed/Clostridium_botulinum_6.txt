Purpose: The significance of botulinum toxin to ophthalmologists is twofold.
Botulism, a medical emergency, frequently presents with ocular findings including
blurred vision, diplopia, ptosis, and photophobia as a result of the neurotoxin
produced by Clostridium botulinum. However, botulinum toxins also have
therapeutic uses for medical conditions including strabismus. The safety and
efficacy of Botulinum toxin A in patients with a history of botulism has not been
reported.
Observations: We report a 9-week-old infant, diagnosed with type B toxin positive
infant botulism treated with human botulism immune globulin, who developed a
large angle exotropia. The infant was treated with intramuscular injections of
botulinum toxin A to the extraocular muscles resulting in a favorable initial
response but ultimately required strabismus surgery. Clinical manifestations and 
management of botulism are reviewed and botulinum toxin in the treatment of
pediatric strabismus is discussed.
Conclusions and importance: This case demonstrates safe administration of
onabotulinumtoxinA to an infant with a history of antitoxin-treated botulism,
resulting in a transient improvement in control of infantile exotropia.
