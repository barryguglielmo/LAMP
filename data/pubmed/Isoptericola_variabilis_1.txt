Two bacterial strains, designated 2DFWM-2T and FW10M-9T, were isolated from gut
of larva of Protaetia brevitarsis seulensis grown at the National Institute of
Agricultural Sciences, Wanju-gun, South Korea. 16S rRNA and rpoB gene sequences
showed that strain 2DFWM-2T formed a separate branch with Lactococcus allomyrinae
1JSPR-7T in the genus Lactococcus, adjacent to a group of Lactococcus lactis
subspecies. ANI and dDDH values between 2DFWM-2T and Lactococcus allomyrinae
1JSPR-7T were 93.30% and 53.20%, respectively. Based on the 16S rRNA gene
sequence analysis, strain FW10M-9T was classified into the genus Xylanimonas
revealing 96.9-98.5% sequence similarities with the Xylanimonas species. The ANI 
values of strain FW10M-9T with the closely species Xylanimonas pachnodae NBRC
107786T, Xylanimonas allomyrinae 2JSPR-7T, Isoptericola variabilis JCM 11754T and
Xylanimonas cellulosilytica DSM 15894T was 81.5%, 81.2%, 81.0% and 84.1%,
respectively, and the dDDH values estimated by GGDC was 24.3%, 24.3%, 29.3% and
28.1%, respectively. On the basis of the phenotypic and genotypic data, it is
proposed that strain 2DFWM-2T represents a novel species of the genus
Lactococcus, for which the name Lactococcus protaetiae sp. nov. is proposed, and 
the type strain is 2DFWM-2T (= KACC 19320T = NBRC 113069T). And, strain FW10M-9T 
represents a novel species of the genus Xylanimonas, for which the name
Xylanimonas protaetiae sp. nov. is proposed, and the type strain is FW10M-9T
(= KACC 19331T = NBRC 113053T).
