An incorrect food regimen from childhood is suggested to negatively impact the
gut microbiome composition leading to obesity and perhaps to colon rectal cancer 
(CRC) in adults. In this study, we show that the obesity and cancer gut
microbiota share a characteristic microbial profile with a high colonization by
mucin degraders species, such as Hafnia alvei and Akkermansia muciniphila. In
addition, the species Clostridium bolteae, a bacterium associated with insulin
resistance, dyslipidemia, and inflammation, has been associated with the presence
of oncogenic Human Polyomaviruses (HPyVs). Merkel cell Polyomavirus (MCPyV) and
BK Polyomavirus (BKPyV) were the most frequently oncogenic viruses recovered in
the gut of both obese and tumor patients. Considering the high seroprevalence of 
HPyVs in childhood, their association with specific bacterial species deserve to 
be further investigated. Data from the present study highlight the presence of a 
similar microbiome pattern in CRC and obese subjects, suggesting that obese
microbiome may represent an opportunity for tumorigenic/driver bacteria and
viruses to trigger cell transformation.
