In this study, we sought to compose consortia of plant growth-promoting (PGP) and
trace element tolerant bacteria, to improve plant growth and inhibit uptake and
translocation of trace elements, eventually allowing the cultivation of
profitmaking crops on trace elements polluted soils, reducing the risks of
entrance of these elements into the food chain. Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) 
was grown on two polluted military soils (MS1 and MS2) in greenhouse microcosms
and inoculated with three different bacterial consortia (C1, C2, C3). Growth and 
physiological status of the plants were unaffected during the experiment with the
inoculation. After 2 months, plants were harvested. Consortium C2 and C3
decreased Pb shoot bioaccumulation by respectively 80-85% when plants were grown 
in the MS1 and even to concentrations below detection limit in plants grown in
MS2. Differences in uptake and (sub)cellular localization of Pb and Cd in
selected bacterial isolates were investigated in vitro by TEM-EDX. Pb absorption 
was observed by Bacillus wiedmanni ST29 and Bacillus paramycoides ST9 cultures.
While adsorption at the bacterial cell wall was observed by Bacillus paramycoides
ST9 and retention in the extracellular matrix by Cellulosimicrobium cellulans
ST54.
