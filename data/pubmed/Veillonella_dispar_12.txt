BACKGROUND: The extent to which the composition and diversity of the oral
microbiome varies with age is not clearly understood.
METHODS: The 16S rRNA gene of subgingival plaque in 1219 women, aged 53-81 years,
was sequenced and its taxonomy annotated against the Human Oral Microbiome
Database (v.14.5). Composition of the subgingival microbiome was described in
terms of centered log(2)-ratio (CLR) transformed OTU values, relative abundance, 
and prevalence. Correlations between microbiota abundance and age were evelauted 
using Pearson Product Moment correlations. P-values were corrected for multiple
testing using the Bonferroni method.
RESULTS: Of the 267 species identified overall, Veillonella dispar was the most
abundant bacteria when described by CLR OTU (mean 8.3) or relative abundance
(mean 8.9%); whereas Streptococcus oralis, Veillonella dispar and Veillonella
parvula were most prevalent (100%, all) when described as being present at any
amount. Linear correlations between age and several CLR OTUs (Pearson r = - 0.18 
to 0.18), of which 82 (31%) achieved statistical significance (P < 0.05). The
correlations lost significance following Bonferroni correction. Twelve species
that differed across age groups (each corrected P < 0.05); 5 (42%) were higher in
women ages 50-59 compared to ≥70 (corrected P < 0.05), and 7 (48%) were higher in
women 70 years and older.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified associations between several bacterial species and age
across the age range of postmenopausal women studied. Understanding the functions
of these bacteria could identify intervention targets to enhance oral health in
later life.
