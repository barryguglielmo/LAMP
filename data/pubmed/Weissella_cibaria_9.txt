Exopolysaccharides (EPSs) produced by lactic acid bacteria improve the quality of
bread; however, their functionality in steamed bread is unknown. This study aimed
to compare the impact of EPS produced during sourdough fermentation on the
quality of bread and steamed bread. Sourdoughs were fermented with EPS-producing 
Fructilactobacillus sanfranciscensis, Weissella cibaria, and Leuconostoc
mesenteroides; Latilactobacillus sakei LS8 and chemically acidified sourdough
were prepared as controls. EPS production generally enhanced the specific volume,
improved the texture, and reduced the staling rate of bread. The effect of EPS on
steamed bread quality was more pronounced when compared to its effect on bread
quality. Remarkably, the beneficial effects of F. sanfranciscensis bread quality 
were largely independent of EPS formation and may relate to gluten modifications 
rather than EPS production. In conclusion, the direct comparison of sourdough and
EPS functionality in steaming and baking provides novel insights for the
optimization of commercial (steamed) bread production.
