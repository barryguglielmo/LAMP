BACKGROUND: Cadmium (Cd) is a severely toxic heavy metal to most microorganisms. 
Many bacteria have developed Cd2+ resistance.
RESULTS: In this study, we isolated two different Cd2+ resistance Bacillus sp.
strains, Bacillus vietamensis 151-6 and Bacillus marisflavi 151-25, which could
be grown in the presence of Cd2+ at concentration up to 0.3 mM and 0.8 mM,
respectively. According to the genomic sequencing, transcriptome analysis under
cadmium stress, and other related experiments, a gene cluster in plasmid p25 was 
found to be a major contributor to Cd2+ resistance in B. marisflavi 151-25. The
cluster in p25 contained orf4802 and orf4803 which encodes an ATPase transporter 
and a transcriptional regulator protein, respectively. Although 151-6 has much
lower Cd2+ resistance than 151-25, they contained similar gene cluster, but in
different locations. A gene cluster on the chromosome containing orf4111, orf4112
and orf4113, which encodes an ATPase transporter, a cadmium efflux system
accessory protein and a cadmium resistance protein, respectively, was found to
play a major role on the Cd2+ resistance for B. vietamensis 151-6.
CONCLUSIONS: This work described cadmium resistance mechanisms in newly isolated 
Bacillus vietamensis 151-6 and Bacillus marisflavi 151-25. Based on homologies to
the cad system (CadA-CadC) in Staphylococcus aureus and analysis of transcriptome
under Cd2+ induction, we inferred that the mechanisms of cadmium resistance in B.
marisflavi 151-25 was as same as the cad system in S. aureus. Although Bacillus
vietamensis 151-6 also had the similar gene cluster to B. marisflavi 151-25 and
S. aureus, its transcriptional regulatory mechanism of cadmium resistance was not
same. This study explored the cadmium resistance mechanism for B. vietamensis
151-6 and B. marisflavi 151-25 and has expanded our understanding of the
biological effects of cadmium.
