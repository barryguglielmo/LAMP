BACKGROUND: Pacu (Piaractus mesopotamicus) is one of the most important
Neotropical aquaculture species from South America. Disease outbreaks caused by
Aeromonas hydrophila infection have been considered significant contributors to
the declining levels of pacu production. The current implementation of genomic
selection for disease resistance has been adopted as a powerful strategy for
improvement in fish species. This study aimed to investigate the genetic
architecture of resistance to A. hydrophila in pacu via Genome-Wide Association
Study (GWAS), the identification of suggestive Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) and
putative genes associated with this trait. The genetic data were obtained from
381 juvenile individuals belonging to 14 full-sibling families. An experimental
challenge was performed to gain access to the levels of genetic variation for
resistance against the bacteria using the following trait definitions: binary
test survival (TS) and time of death (TD).
RESULTS: The analyses of genetic parameters estimated moderate heritability (h2) 
for both resistance traits: 0.20 (± 0.09) for TS and 0.35 (± 0.15) for TD. A
linkage map for pacu was developed to enable the GWAS, resulting in 27 linkage
groups (LGs) with 17,453 mapped Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). The
length of the LGs varied from 79.95 (LG14) to 137.01 (LG1) cM, with a total map
length of 2755.60 cM. GWAS identified 22 putative QTLs associated to A.
hydrophila resistance. They were distributed into 17 LGs, and were considered
suggestive genomic regions explaining > 1% of the additive genetic variance (AGV)
for the trait. Several candidate genes related to immune response were located
close to the suggestive QTLs, such as tbk1, trim16, Il12rb2 and lyz2.
CONCLUSION: This study describes the development of the first medium density
linkage map for pacu, which will be used as a framework to study relevant traits 
to the production of this species. In addition, the resistance to A. hydrophila
was found to be moderately heritable but with a polygenic architecture suggesting
that genomic selection, instead of marker assisted selection, might be useful for
efficiently improving resistance to one of the most problematic diseases that
affects the South American aquaculture.
