Non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) disease is a rare cause of neutropenic fever 
in patients with hematological malignancies. There are few studies on the optimal
management for such patients with NTM. We report a case of myelodysplastic
syndrome (MDS) treated by umbilical cord blood transplantation (CBT) after
Mycobacterium kansasii (M. kansasii) pneumonia. A 38-year-old man diagnosed with 
MDS developed severe pneumonia during induction chemotherapy. Repeated sputum
culture uncovered mycobacterium infection. Then, by the polymerase chain reaction
of the bronchial lavage fluid, M. kansasii infection was proven. After 140 days
of anti-NTM therapy, CBT was successfully carried out and the patient recovered
without recurrence of NTM infection. This case provides valuable evidence that
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is feasible after a reliable diagnosis
and continuous anti-NTM therapy.
