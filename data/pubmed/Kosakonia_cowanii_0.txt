BACKGROUND: Kosakonia cowanii, formerly known as Enterobacter cowanii, is a
Gram-negative bacillus belonging to the order Enterobacterales. The species is
usually recognized as a plant pathogen and has only anecdotally been encountered 
as a human pathogen. Here we describe the rare case of a K. cowanii infection
presenting as an acute cholecystitis and provide a review of available
literature. Evident difficulties in species identification by biochemical
profiling suggests that potentially, K. cowanii might represent an underestimated
human pathogen.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 61-year old immunocompromised man presented to the hospital 
with fever and pain in the upper right abdomen. Sonography revealed an inflamed
gall bladder and several gall stones. A cholecystectomy proved diagnosis of an
acute cholecystitis with a partial necrosis of the gall bladder. Surgical
specimen grew pure cultures of Gram-negative rods unambiguously identified as K. 
cowanii by MALDI-TOF, 16S-rRNA analysis and whole genome sequencing.
CONCLUSIONS: Reporting cases of Kosakonia species can shed light on the
prevalence and clinical importance of this rare cause of human infection. Our
case is the first to describe an infection without prior traumatic inoculation of
the pathogen from its usual habitat, a plant, to the patient. This raises the
question of the route of infections as well as the pathogen's ability to colonize
the human gut.
