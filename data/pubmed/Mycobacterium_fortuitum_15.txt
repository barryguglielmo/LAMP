Mycobacterium Fortuitum (M. Fortuitum) is a type of opportunistic pathogen
commonly found in water/soil and belongs to the nontuberculosis mycobacteria
(NTM) family. Prosthetic joint infection due to M. Fortuitum is extremely rare.
We present a case of a 21-year-old female with an infection following a radical
resection of the proximal tibia due to a parosteal osteosarcoma.
