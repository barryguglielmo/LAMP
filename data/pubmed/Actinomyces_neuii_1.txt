Actinomyces neuii is an opportunistic pathogen. Within the urogenital tract, it
has been associated with bacterial vaginosis and overactive bladder symptoms.
Here, we investigate a draft genome sequence of A. neuii UMB1295, which was
isolated from a catheterized urine sample from a woman with a urinary tract
infection.
