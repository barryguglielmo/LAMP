The probiotic efficacy and fermentative ability of Lactobacillus delbrueckii
subsp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus), a widely used probiotic, is majorly affected
by its acid tolerance. Here, we conducted whole-genome sequencing of the high
acid-tolerant L. bulgaricus LJJ stored in the laboratory. Compared with the whole
genome of low acid-tolerant strain L. bulgaricus ATCC11842, the results show that
16 candidate acid-tolerant genes may be involved in the regulation of the acid
tolerance of L. bulgaricus LJJ. Association analysis of candidate acid-tolerant
genes and acid-tolerant traits of different L. bulgaricus strains revealed that
the three genes dapA, dapH, and lysC are the main reasons for the strong acid
tolerance of L. bulgaricus LJJ. The results of real-time quantitative PCR
(RT-qPCR) supported this conclusion. KEGG pathway analysis showed that these
three acid-tolerant genes are involved in the synthesis of lysine; the synthesis 
of lysine may confer L. bulgaricus LJJ strong acid tolerance. This study
successfully revealed the acid tolerance mechanism of L. bulgaricus LJJ and
provides a theoretical basis for the subsequent selection of strains with high
acid tolerance for improved probiotic functions. KEY POINTS: • Three genes are
identified as acid-tolerant genes, respectively, lysC, dapA, and dapH. • LysC and
dapA are the major key genes in the synthesis of lysine. • The synthesis of
lysine may confer L. bulgaricus LJJ strong acid tolerance.
