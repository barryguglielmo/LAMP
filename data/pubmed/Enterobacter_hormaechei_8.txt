Combating plasmid-mediated carbapenem resistance is essential to control and
prevent the dissemination of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). Here,
we conducted a proof-of-concept study to demonstrate that CRISPR-Cas9-mediated
resistance gene and plasmid curing can effectively resensitize CRE to
carbapenems. A novel CRISPR-Cas9-mediated plasmid-curing system (pCasCure) was
developed and electrotransferred into various clinical CRE isolates. The results 
showed that pCasCure can effectively cure bla KPC, bla NDM, and bla OXA-48 in
various Enterobacteriaceae species of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli,
Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterobacter xiangfangensis, and Serratia marcescens
clinical isolates, with a >94% curing efficiency. In addition, we also
demonstrated that pCasCure can efficiently eliminate several epidemic
carbapenem-resistant plasmids, including the bla KPC-harboring IncFIIK-pKpQIL and
IncN pKp58_N plasmids, the bla OXA-48-harboring pOXA-48-like plasmid, and the bla
NDM-harboring IncX3 plasmid, by targeting their replication and partitioning
(parA in pKpQIL) genes. However, curing the bla OXA-48 gene failed to eliminate
its corresponding pOXA-48-like plasmid in clinical K. pneumoniae isolate 49210,
while further next-generation sequencing revealed that it was due to
IS1R-mediated recombination outside the CRISPR-Cas9 cleavage site resulting in
bla OXA-48 truncation and, therefore, escaped plasmid curing. Nevertheless, the
curing of carbapenemase genes or plasmids, including the truncation of bla OXA-48
in 49210, successfully restore their susceptibility to carbapenems, with a
>8-fold reduction of MIC values in all tested isolates. Taken together, our study
confirmed the concept of using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated carbapenemase gene and
plasmid curing to resensitize CRE to carbapenems. Further work is needed to
integrate pCasCure in an optimal delivery system to make it applicable for
clinical intervention.
