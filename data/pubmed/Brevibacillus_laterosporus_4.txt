Leaf blight is the main disease of Asarum. At present, chemical treatment is main
measure for disease control, and there is no report on biological control. In
order to achieve the biological control of Asarum leaf blight, the biocontrol
strains with antagonistic effect on Asarum leaf blight were screened. The
rhizosphere bacteria of healthy Asarum plants were isolated by soil dilution
method, and the isolated strains were screened by the methods of antagonistic
antifungal and fermentation liquid antifungal, then the strains were identified
and the control effect in vivo was determined. Abiocontrol bacterial strains
S2-31 which with high antagonism to leaf blight was obtained from more than 100
isolated strains. The inhibitory rates of antagonistic antifungal and
fermentation liquid antifungal reached 92.47% and 60.56%, respectively. It was
identified by morphology and 16 S rDNA sequence analysis, and the strain was
identified as Brevibacillus laterosporus. The results of indoor potted experiment
showed that the control effect was 79.87%, 71.44% and 66.82% on the 3 rd, 5 th
and 7 th day after inoculation, respectively, which indicated that S2-31 could
reduce the disease index and control the development of Asarum leaf blight.
