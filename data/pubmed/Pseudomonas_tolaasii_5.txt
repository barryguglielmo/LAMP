BACKGROUND: The equine conjunctival microbiota has often been reported to be
dominated by Gram-positive species such as Staphylococcus sp., Bacillus sp., and 
Corynebacterium sp. However, traditional culture-based methods can only recover a
fraction of the bacterial species present in the sample.
OBJECTIVES: This pilot study aimed at exploring the diversity of the equine
conjunctival microbiota using culture-independent methods.
STUDY DESIGN: Eight horses were included in this study, and only eyes with normal
ophthalmic examination (n = 15 eyes) were sampled.
METHODS: Conjunctival biopsies (culture-independent) were collected, and DNA was 
extracted from the tissues. Bacterial communities in conjunctival biopsies were
characterized by next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes. Individual
reads were ascribed to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using BLASTn and
Greengenes databases. Species richness, evenness, and Good's coverage were
determined for each conjunctiva-associated microbial community.
RESULTS: Culture-independent samples produced a total of 329 bacterial OTUs. The 
main OTUs identified in the study belonged to the Gram-negative species Ralstonia
mannitolilytica (88.0%), Nicoletella semolina (3.3%), and Pseudomonas tolaasii
(1.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to previously published data based on culture-dependent
methods, the horse eye microbial community was dominated by Gram-negative
bacteria of the phylum Proteobacteria.
