BACKGROUND: Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is one of the main causes of
infectious diseases in cattle and causes large financial losses to the cattle
industry worldwide. In this study, Lactobacillus casei strain W56 (Lc W56) was
used as antigen deliver carrier to construct a recombinant Lactobacillus vaccine 
pPG-E2-ctxB/Lc W56 constitutively expressing BVDV E2 protein fused with cholera
toxin B subunit (ctxB) as an adjuvant, and its immunogenicity against BVDV
infection in mice model by oral route was explored.
RESULTS: Our results suggested that pPG-E2-ctxB/Lc W56 can effectively activate
dendritic cells (DCs) in the Peyer's patches, up-regulate the expression of
Bcl-6, and promote T-follicular helper (Tfh) cells differentiation, as well as
enhance B lymphocyte proliferation and promote them differentiate into specific
IgA-secreting plasma cells, secreting anti-E2 mucosal sIgA antibody with
BVDV-neutralizing activity. Moreover, significant levels (p < 0.01) of
BVDV-neutralizing antigen-specific serum antibodies were induced in the
pPG-E2-ctxB/LC W56 group post-vaccination. The recombinant Lactobacillus vaccine 
can induce cellular immune responses, and significant levels (p < 0.01) of
Th1-associated cytokines (IL-2, IL-12, and IFN-γ), Th2-associated cytokines
(IL-4, IL-10) and Th17-associated cytokine (IL-17) were determined in the serum
of vaccinated mice. Significantly, the recombinant Lactobacillus vaccine provides
immune protection against BVDV infection, which can be cleared effectively by the
vaccine post-challenge in orally vaccinated animals.
CONCLUSIONS: The genetically engineered Lactobacillus vaccine constructed in this
study is immunogenic in mice and can induce mucosal, humoral, and cellular immune
responses, providing effective anti-BVDV immune protection. It thus represents a 
promising strategy for vaccine development against BVDV.
