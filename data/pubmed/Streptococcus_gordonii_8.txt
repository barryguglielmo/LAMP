BACKGROUND: To respond and adapt to environmental challenges, prokaryotes
regulate cellular processes rapidly and reversibly through protein
phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. This study investigates the intracellular 
proteome and Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphoproteome of the oral commensal Streptococcus
gordonii. Intracellular proteins from planktonic cells of S. gordonii DL1 were
extracted and subjected to 2D-gel electrophoresis. Proteins in general were
visualized using Coomassie Brilliant Blue and T-Rex staining. Phosphorylated
proteins were visualized with Pro-Q Diamond Phosphoprotein Gel Stain. Proteins
were identified by LC-MS/MS and sequence analysis.
RESULTS: In total, sixty-one intracellular proteins were identified in S.
gordonii DL1, many of which occurred at multiple isoelectric points. Nineteen of 
these proteins were present as one or more Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphorylated form. The
identified phosphoproteins turned out to be involved in a variety of cellular
processes.
CONCLUSION: Nineteen phosphoproteins involved in various cellular functions were 
identified in S. gordonii. This is the first time the global intracellular
Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphorylation profile has been analysed in an oral streptococcus.
Comparison with phosphoproteomes of other species from previous studies showed
many similarities. Proteins that are consistently found in a phosphorylated state
across several species and growth conditions may represent a core phosphoproteome
profile shared by many bacteria.
