BACKGROUND: Changes to human respiratory tract microbiome may contribute
significantly to the progression of respiratory diseases. However, there are few 
studies examining the relative abundance of microbial communities at the species 
level along the human respiratory tract.
FINDINGS: Bronchoalveolar lavage, throat swab, mouth rinse, and nasal swab
samples were collected from 5 participants. Bacterial ribosomal operons were
sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore MinION to determine the relative abundance of
bacterial species in 4 compartments along the respiratory tract. More than 1.8
million raw operon reads were obtained from the participants with ∼600,000 rRNA
reads passing quality assurance/quality control (70-95% identify; >1,200 bp
alignment) by Discontiguous MegaBLAST against the EZ BioCloud 16S rRNA gene
database. Nearly 3,600 bacterial species were detected overall (>750 bacterial
species within the 5 dominant phyla: Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, 
Bacteroidetes, and Fusobacteria. The relative abundance of bacterial species
along the respiratory tract indicated that most microbes (95%) were being
passively transported from outside into the lung. However, a small percentage
(<5%) of bacterial species were at higher abundance within the lavage samples.
The most abundant lung-enriched bacterial species were Veillonella dispar and
Veillonella atypica while the most abundant mouth-associated bacterial species
were Streptococcus infantis and Streptococcus mitis.
CONCLUSIONS: Most bacteria detected in lower respiratory samples do not seem to
colonize the lung. However, >100 bacterial species were found to be enriched in
bronchoalveolar lavage samples (compared to mouth/nose) and may play a
substantial role in lung health.
