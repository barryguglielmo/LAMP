Cas13 has demonstrated unique and broad utility in RNA editing, nucleic acid
detection, and disease diagnosis; however, a constantly active Cas enzyme may
induce unwanted effects. Bacteriophage- or prophage-region-encoded anti-CRISPR
(acr) gene molecules provide the potential to control targeting specificity and
potency to allow for optimal RNA editing and nucleic acid detection by
spatiotemporally modulating endonuclease activities. Using integrated approaches 
to screen acrVI candidates and evaluate their effects on Cas13 function, we
discovered a series of acrVIA1-7 genes that block the activities of Cas13a. These
VI-A CRISPR inhibitors substantially attenuate RNA targeting and editing by
Cas13a in human cells. Strikingly, type VI-A anti-CRISPRs (AcrVIAs) also
significantly muffle the single-nucleic-acid editing ability of the dCas13a
RNA-editing system. Mechanistically, AcrVIA1, -4, -5, and -6 bind LwaCas13a,
while AcrVIA2 and -3 can only bind the LwaCas13-crRNA (CRISPR RNA) complex. These
identified acr molecules may enable precise RNA editing in Cas13-based
application and study of phage-bacterium interaction.
