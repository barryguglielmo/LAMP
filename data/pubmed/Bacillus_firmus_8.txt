This study was conducted to determine the ability of a bacterial strain FSS2C to 
ameliorate growth of wheat plants grown under induced stress of reactive black-5 
(RB-5). The strain was taxonomically identified as Bacillus firmus on the basis
of its 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The B. firmus FSS2C was found
physiologically potent in phosphate solubilization, indole-3-acetic acid
production and ammonia synthesis in the presence of varying concentrations of azo
dye RB-5. Moreover, it decolorized RB-5 in vitro with the maximum decolorization 
(%) found at pH 7 and 30 °C. Inoculation of wheat plants, growing under stress
induced by RB-5 dye, with rifampicin-resistant derivatives of the strain FSS2C
substantially reduced the cellular oxidative stress, thereby resulting in higher 
plant biomass as compared to non-inoculated plants. Similarly, the inoculated
plants revealed higher nutrient content in shoots as compared to non-inoculated
ones. It was concluded that B. firmus strain FSS2C alleviated the oxidative
stress impairment caused by reactive black-5 in wheat plants. Therefore, the
strain can be used as bio-inoculant in wastewater irrigated soils.
