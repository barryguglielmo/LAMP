Whipple's disease is a rare and difficult-to-diagnose infectious disease, related
to infection by gram-positive bacillum Tropheryma whipplei Clinical
manifestations are very variable, but the classic form usually begins with
recurring arthritis, followed several years later by non-specific abdominal
symptoms, leading to late diagnosis. We present the case of a 52-year-old man who
was admitted in the emergency department with an insidious clinical picture
characterised by weight loss, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and arthralgias. An
abdominal ultrasound was performed, showing findings suggestive of Whipple's
disease, which, in conjunction with the clinical and laboratory findings, allowed
the diagnosis to be correctly addressed. Upper endoscopy with duodenal biopsy
revealed findings compatible with Whipple's disease, and the diagnosis was also
confirmed through PCR techniques of blood. The patient was given antibiotic
therapy, with rapid and substantial clinical improvement.
