Ultrasound (US) combined with chemical agents could represent an effective method
for decontaminating fruits and vegetables. This study aimed to evaluate the use
of US (49 kHz for 5 min) alone or with 1% lactic acid (LA), 1% commercial
detergent (DET), or 6 mg/L silver nanoparticles (AgNP, average diameter 100 nm)
as an alternative treatment to 200 mg/L sodium dichloroisocyanurate (SD) for
inactivating Salmonella enterica Enteritidis present on cherry tomatoes. The
interfacial tension between sanitizing solutions and bacterial adhesion was
investigated. Sanitizers in solutions with DET and NP had lower surface tension. 
All treatments, except that with DET, reduced S. Enteritidis by more than one
logarithmic cycle. There was no significant difference between the mean values of
log CFU/g reduction in all treatments. Transmission electron microscopy revealed 
the loss of the S. Enteritidis capsule following treatments with US and US + LA. 
S. Enteritidis counts (2.29 log CFU/g) in cherry tomatoes were markedly reduced
to safe levels by treatment with the combination of NP and US + LA (2.37 log
CFU/g).
