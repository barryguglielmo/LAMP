BACKGROUND: S. aureus is the dominant infective trigger of atopic dermatitis
(AD). How this bacterium drives type 2 allergic pathology in the absence of
infection in AD patients is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the S. aureus-derived virulence factor(s) that initiates
the cutaneous type 2-promoting immune response responsible for AD.
METHODS: In vitro human keratinocyte cell culture, ex vivo human skin organ
explants and the eczema prone Nc/Tnd mouse were used as model systems to assess
type-2 promoting immune responses to S. aureus. Identification of the bioactive
factor was accomplished using Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography and mass
spectrometry. Bioactivity was confirmed by cloning and expression in an E. coli
vector system, and S. aureus Sbi mutant strains confirming loss of activity.
RESULTS: S. aureus was unique amongst staphylococcal species in its ability to
induce the rapid release of constitutive IL-33 from human keratinocytes
independent of the toll-like receptor pathway. Using the eczema-prone NC/Tnd
mouse model, we showed that IL-33 was essential in inducing the immune response
to S. aureus in vivo. By fractionation and candidate testing, we identified the
Second Immunoglobulin-Binding Protein (Sbi) as the predominant
staphylococcus-derived virulence factor that directly drives IL-33 release from
human keratinocytes. Immunohistology of skin demonstrated that corneodesmosin, a 
component of corneodesmosomes that form key intercellular adhesive structures in 
the stratum corneum, was disrupted resulting in reduction of skin barrier
function.
CONCLUSION: S. aureus-derived Sbi is a unique type 2-promoting virulence factor
capable of initiating the type-2 promoting cytokine activity underlying AD.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The Second Immunoglobulin-Binding Protein (Sbi) produced
solely by S. aureus species, is an important factor inducing type-2 promoting
cytokine responses and atopic dermatitis.
