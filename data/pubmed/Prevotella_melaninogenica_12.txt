INTRODUCTION: Human papilloma virus (HPV) and oral bacteria capable of
acetaldehyde production from ethanol, such as Streptococcus anginosus, Prevotella
melaninogenica, and Fusobacterium naviforme are among oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma (OSCC) infectious risk factors.
OBJECTIVE: Determine associations with HPV and S. anginosus, P. melaninogenica,
and F. naviforme in patients with and without OSCC.
METHODS: Presence of HPV and HPV-16 was determined in 26 patients with OSCC and
26 without OSCC by conventional PCR and simultaneous presence of S. anginosus, P.
melaninogenica, and F. naviforme quantification through q-PCR. Statistical
analysis was carried out using Pearson's X² and Student's-t test.
RESULTS: Patients with OSCC had HPV and HPV-16 frequencies of 84% and 61.5%,
respectively, in contrast for patients without OSCC frequencies were 34.6 and
30.7%. P. melaninogenica, and F. naviforme microorganisms were not present in any
participant in this study. S. anginosus frequency in patients with OSC was 38.4% 
and in patients without OSCC was 30.7%. Patients with OSCC had S. anginosus + HPV
co-infection at a 38.4% frequency and S. anginosus + HPV-16 at a 23.1% frequency.
For individuals without OSCC S. anginosus + HPV co-infection was 3.8% and S.
anginosus + HPV-16 3.8%. A greater frequency of S. anginosus + HPV co-infection
and S. anginosus + HPV-16 was observed in patients with OSCC in comparison with
individuals without OSCC, suggesting the importance of detecting HPV/HPV-16 and
S. anginosus simultaneously in individuals at risk of developing OSCC.
