BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, recurrent skin condition with
recently increased incidence in younger children. AD development has been
correlated with the skin microbiome, and Staphylococcus aureus enrichment causes 
significant increases in skin lesions.
OBJECTIVE: Our objectives were to compare the microbial diversity of the cheek
skin of children with or without AD aged 0-1 years in China, and to determine
whether 4 types of skin-isolated bacteria could inhibit S. aureus in vitro.
METHODS: The skin microbial samples of cheek skin of children were sequenced by
16S rRNA V1-V2 region. Four skin isolated bacterial fermentation supernatants
were tested for effects on S. aureus growth, membrane formation, and induction of
cytokine secretion from HaCaT cells.
RESULTS: Bacterial diversity decreased significantly in skin with severe AD
compared to healthy skin (p < 0.01). Seven phyla had content >1%, 4 of which
differed in AD (p < 0.05). 38 genera had content >1%, 15 differed (p < 0.05).
Differences in 8 species were observed (p < 0.05). In vitro antibacterial and
cellular experiments showed that S. aureus growth, biofilm formation, and
induction of interleukin (IL)-1α and IL-6 secretion from HaCaT cells were
significantly inhibited by Klebsiella oxytoca, Kocuria rhizophila, and
Staphylococcus epidermidis culture supernatants (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Skin microbiome changes in children varied with age and with AD.
There were complex interactions between skin isolated bacteria and S. aureus
which could inhibit S. aureus growth and biofilm formation in vitro, suggesting
that these microorganisms could be used in AD treatment.
