Alcaligenes spp. are identified as commensal bacteria and have been found to
inhabit Peyer's patches in the gut. We previously reported that
Alcaligenes-derived lipopolysaccharides (LPS) exerted adjuvant activity in
systemic vaccination, without excessive inflammation. Lipid A is one of the
components responsible for the biological effect of LPS and has previously been
applied as an adjuvant. Here, we examined the adjuvant activity and safety of
chemically synthesized Alcaligenes lipid A. We found that levels of OVA-specific 
serum IgG antibodies increased in mice that were subcutaneously immunized with
ovalbumin (OVA) plus Alcaligenes lipid A relative to those that were immunized
with OVA alone. In addition, Alcaligenes lipid A promoted antigen-specific T
helper 17 (Th17) responses in the spleen; upregulated the expression of MHC class
II, CD40, CD80, and CD86 on bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs); enhanced
the production of Th17-inducing cytokines IL-6 and IL-23 from BMDCs. Stimulation 
with Alcaligenes lipid A also induced the production of IL-6 and IL-1Î² in human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Moreover, Alcaligenes lipid A caused minor
side effects, such as lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. These findings suggest
that Alcaligenes lipid A is a safe and effective Th17-type adjuvant by directly
stimulating dendritic cells in systemic vaccination.
