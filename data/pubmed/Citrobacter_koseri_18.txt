OBJECTIVES: This study reported the resistome content of sewage sludge-isolated
carbapenem-resistant Citrobacter koseri (C. koseri) carrying blaOXA-181. It also 
provided a general phylogenomic analysis highlighting antibiotic resistance genes
(ARGs), plasmids and pathogenicity of C. koseri genomes.
METHODS: The carbapenem-resistantC. koseri AS1 strain was isolated from sewage
sludge on CHROMagar™ mSuperCARBA™ media. Whole genome sequencing of C. koseri AS1
was performed using an HiSeq X™ Ten instrument. Additional C. koseri genomes were
downloaded from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).
Phylogenomic analysis was established through CSI Phylogeny. ARGs, plasmids and
pathogenicity were identified using ResFinder 3.1, PlasmidFinder 2.0 and
PathogenFinder 1.1, respectively.
RESULTS: The phylogenomic tree indicated a polyclonal pattern ofC. koseri
genomes. Resistome analysis of C. koseri AS1 revealed β-lactam resistance genes
(blaMAL-1 and blaOXA-181) as well as a fosfomycin resistance gene (fosA7). Three 
plasmids (ColKP3, ColRNAI and IncX30) were identiﬁed in the C. koseri AS1 genome.
In addition, 25 ARGs were found in downloaded genomes. Of these, clinically
significant ARGs such as blaKPC-2 and blaOXA-48 were found in two and four
genomes, respectively. Assessment of the genomes using PathogenFinder revealed
all genomes as putative human pathogens.
CONCLUSIONS: It is believed that noC. koseri genome has been reported to carry
blaOXA-181; therefore, C. koseri AS1 is the first of its kind. This study also
highlighted the resistome contents of C. koseri genomes.
