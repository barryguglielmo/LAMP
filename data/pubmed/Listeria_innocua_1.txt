ABSTRACT: The Food Safety Modernization Act, specifically the Produce Safety
Rule, requires growers to clean and sanitize food contact surfaces to protect
against produce contamination. An ATP monitoring device is a potential sanitation
tool to monitor the efficacy of an on-farm cleaning and sanitation program that
could help growers meet regulatory expectations mandated by the Produce Safety
Rule. This ATP monitoring device uses bioluminescence to detect all ATP (found in
bacteria and produce matter cells) from a swabbed surface. Because little work
has been done to test the efficacy of these tools under postharvest conditions,
the present study evaluated ATP measurement for postharvest food contact surface 
cleanliness evaluation. Concentrations of leafy greens (spinach, romaine, and red
cabbage, with or without Listeria innocua) were used as organic matter applied to
stainless steel, high-density polyethylene plastic, and bamboo wood coupons to
represent postharvest food contact surfaces. The ATP levels on the coupons were
then measured by using swabs and an ATP monitoring device. Results showed that
the concentration of L. innocua and leafy greens on a food contact surface had a 
highly significant effect on the ATP monitoring device reading (P < 0.0001). The 
ATP monitoring device had a lower limit of detection for L. innocua at 4.5 log
CFU per coupon. The type of leafy green on a food contact surface did not affect 
the ATP reading (P = 0.88). Leafy greens with added L. innocua had a higher ATP
reading when compared with saline and L. innocua, demonstrating the presence of
leafy green matter contributes to ATP reading when combined with L. innocua. The 
different food contact surfaces had different ATP response readings (P = 0.03),
resulting in no detectable levels of bacteria and/or leafy green material from
bamboo wood surfaces (P = 0.16). On the basis of our results, the ATP measurement
is an appropriate tool to measure produce or bacterial contamination on stainless
steel or high-density polyethylene plastic surfaces; however, it is not
recommended for wood surfaces.
