Acidogenic clostridia naturally producing acetic and butyric acids has attracted 
high interest as a novel host for butyrate and n-butanol production. Among them, 
Clostridium tyrobutyricum is a hyper butyrate-producing bacterium, which
re-assimilates acetate for butyrate biosynthesis by butyryl-CoA/acetate CoA
transferase (CoAT), rather than the phosphotransbutyrylase-butyrate kinase
(PTB-BK) pathway widely found in clostridia and other microbial species. To date,
C. tyrobutyricum has been engineered to overexpress a heterologous
alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase, which converts butyryl-CoA to n-butanol. Compared
to conventional solventogenic clostridia, which produce acetone, ethanol, and
butanol in a biphasic fermentation process, the engineered C. tyrobutyricum with 
a high metabolic flux toward butyryl-CoA produced n-butanol at a high yield
of > 0.30 g/g and titer of > 20 g/L in glucose fermentation. With no acetone
production and a high C4/C2 ratio, butanol was the only major fermentation
product by the recombinant C. tyrobutyricum, allowing simplified downstream
processing for product purification. In this review, novel metabolic engineering 
strategies to improve n-butanol and butyrate production by C. tyrobutyricum from 
various substrates, including glucose, xylose, galactose, sucrose, and cellulosic
hydrolysates containing the mixture of glucose and xylose, are discussed.
Compared to other recombinant hosts such as Clostridium acetobutylicum and
Escherichia coli, the engineered C. tyrobutyricum strains with higher butyrate
and butanol titers, yields and productivities are the most promising hosts for
potential industrial applications.
