Infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae are a growing
concern worldwide. Raoultella ornithinolytica is a species in the
Enterobacteriaceae family which can cause hospital-acquired infections and is
sporadically reported as carbapenem-resistant from human and environmental
sources. In this study, we firstly report on an NDM-1-producing
R. ornithinolytica, Rao166, isolated from drinking water in an animal cultivation
area in China. In addition to carbapenem-resistance, Rao166 was resistant to
several other antibiotics including gentamicin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim,
tetracycline and fosfomycin. Rao166 carried a novel IncFIC-type megaplasmid,
382,325 bp in length (pRAO166a). A multidrug resistance region, 60,600 bp in
length, was identified in the plasmid containing an aac(3)-IId-like gene,
aac(6')-Ib-cr, blaDHA-1, blaTEM-1B, blaCTX-M-3, blaOXA-1, blaNDM-1, qnrB4, catB3,
arr-3, sul1, and tet(D). Results from virulence assays implied that Rao166 has
considerable pathogenic potential. Although pRAO166a was found to be
non-transmissible, dissemination of the NDM-1 producing strain may occur from
well water to humans or animals through cross-contamination during food
preparation or directly via drinking water, and potentially lead to
difficult-to-treat infections. Thus, contamination of well water by this
carbapenem-resistant and presumptively virulent strain of R. ornithinolytica
should be considered a potential public health risk.
