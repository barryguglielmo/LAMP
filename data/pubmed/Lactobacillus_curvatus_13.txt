Microorganism selection is critical to deglycosylation in soybean fermentation
for producing beneficial phytochemicals. This study investigated isoflavone
bioconversion in soybean extract inoculated with Lactobacillus plantarum K2-12
and Lactobacillus curvatus JD0-31 exhibiting different enzyme activities. L.
plantarum showed higher esterase (C4), esterase (C8), β-galactosidase,
α-glucosidase, β-glucosidase, and N-acetyl-β-glucosaminase activities. We found
that isoflavone bioconversion was distinguished into isoflavone backbone
structure types. Malonyl- and acetyl- types of isoflavones except for malonyl
daidzin were not significantly differed their contents between lactobacilli.
Deglycosylating severity was observed in malonyl genistin in both lactobacilli,
resulting mass production of genistein. On the other hand, daidzein glycosides
were dependable to lactobacilli, in which L. plantarum efficiently degraded
malonyl daidzin and daidzin in fast time. Glycitein was most degradable among the
three aglycones by fermentation. These results suggest that efficient control of 
isoflavone deglycosylation by Lactobacillus species should be controlled to the
inoculation period and select target isoflavones.
