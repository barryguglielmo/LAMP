5-Cyanovaleramide (5-CVAM) is an important intermediate of a herbicide and
chemical raw material. Herein, we found a novel nitrile hydratase from the strain
Rhodococcus erythropolis CCM2595, exhibiting high regioselectivity with higher
substrate specificity toward dinitriles than mononitriles. In the past, the
strain was shown to degrade only phenol, hydroxybenzoate, p-chlorophenol,
aniline, and other aromatic compounds. In our study, 20 mM adiponitrile was
completely consumed within 10 min with 95% selectivity to 5-CVAM and 5%
selectivity to adipamide. In addition to its high regioselectivity, our
recombinant Escherichia coli showed a higher substrate tolerance of up to 200 mM 
adiponitrile even after 3 h when compared with two reported strains with their
cyano-tolerance concentrations of up to 100 mM, which is considered to be the
highest cyano-tolerance. Such a robust biocatalyst is a desirable attribute of a 
biocatalyst intended for use in commercial applications of 5-CVAM.
