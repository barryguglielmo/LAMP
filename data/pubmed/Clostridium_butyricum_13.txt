Short-chain cello-oligosaccharides (COS; degree of polymerization, DP ≤ 6) are
promising water-soluble dietary fibers. An efficient approach to their bottom-up 
synthesis is from sucrose and glucose using glycoside phosphorylases. Here, we
show the intensification and scale up (20 mL; gram scale) of COS production to 93
g/L product and in 82 mol % yield from sucrose (0.5 M). The COS were comprised of
DP 3 (33 wt %), DP 4 (34 wt %), DP 5 (24 wt %), and DP 6 (9 wt %) and involved
minimal loss (≤10 mol %) to insoluble fractions. After isolation (≥95% purity;
≥90% yield), the COS were examined for growth promotion of probiotic strains.
Benchmarked against inulin, trans-galacto-oligosaccharides, and cellobiose, COS
showed up to 4.1-fold stimulation of cell density for Clostridium butyricum,
Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, and
Lactobacillus rhamnosus but were less efficient with Bifidobacterium sp. This
study shows the COS as selectively functional carbohydrates with prebiotic
potential and demonstrates their efficient enzymatic production.
