Strain SIT17T was isolated from the stool of a healthy 13-month-old Senegalese
boy. It is a Gram-positive, anaerobic, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming and mobile
bacterium. It exhibited 92.74% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with the
Brassicibacter thermophilus strain Cel2f, the phylogenetically most closely
related species. Its genome is about 2.87 Mb long with 27.39 mol% G + C content. 
We provide more details of Senegalia massiliensis strain SIT17T (=
CSURP2130 = DSM 103071), the creation of which was previously announced.
