Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (APDT) has gained increased attention because 
of its broad spectrum activity and lower likelihood to elicit bacterial
resistance. Although many photosensitizers excel at eradicating Gram-positive
bacterial infections, they are generally less potent when utilized against
Gram-negative bacteria. We hypothesized that conjugating the DNA-targeting,
antimicrobial peptide buforin II to a metal-based photosensitizer would result in
a potent APDT agent. Herein, we present the synthesis and characterization of a
buforin II-[Ru(bpy)3]2+ bioconjugate (1). The submicromolar activity of 1 against
the multidrug-resistant strains Escherichia coli AR 0114 and Acinetobacter
baumannii Naval-17 indicates strong synergy between the ruthenium complex and
buforin II. Our mechanistic studies point to an increased rate of DNA damage by 1
compared to [Ru(bpy)3]2+. These results suggest that conjugating metal complexes 
to antimicrobial peptides can lead to potent antimicrobial agents.
