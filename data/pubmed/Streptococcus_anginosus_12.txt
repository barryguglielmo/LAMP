Gut microbiota has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune
diseases. This is still an area of active research given that the role of gut
microbiota on the primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) remains unclear. In this 
study, fecal samples of 30 untreated adult primary ITP patients and 29 healthy
controls (HCs) were used to investigate the gut microbial community and
metabolite profiles. Our results show that fecal bacteria such as Blautia,
Streptococcus, and Lactobacillus are enriched, whereas bacteria such as
Bacteroides are depleted in ITP patients. Notably, fecal metabolites such as
fatty acyls and glycerophospholipids are enriched and strongly correlate with
discrepant gut microbiota. Furthermore, combinations of Weissella and
Streptococcus anginosus, or Cer (t18:0/16:0), Cer (d18:1/17:0), and
13-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid could provide good diagnostic markers for ITP.
Moreover, a strong negative correlation was found between platelet count and
altered gut microbiota such as S. anginosus and gut metabolites such as Cer
(t18:0/16:0) in ITP. In conclusion, dysbiosis of both gut microbiota and
metabolome develops in ITP patients compared to HCs. Several ITP-altered gut
bacteria and metabolites can be diagnostic biomarkers for ITP, and are highly
correlated with platelet count, suggesting that they may also play a role in ITP 
pathogenesis.
