We describe the case of a 67-year-old asymptomatic man who was referred to our
hospital for abnormal laboratory results. He was incidentally found to have a
massive empyema without underlying bronchopulmonary pneumonia. Following
thoracentesis, he was diagnosed with chronic Streptococcus anginosus empyema.
Therapeutic thoracentesis and treatment with tissue plasminogen activator and
deoxyribonuclease failed to resolve the empyema, and there was residual loculated
pleural fluid that was surrounded by a thick rind. The patient was referred to
thoracic surgery for decortication of the pleural space via video-assisted
thoracoscopic surgery. At 2-month follow-up, the patient had complete
re-expansion of the lung tissue.
