X-box protein 1 (Xbp1), an essential transcription factor including an unstable
form (Xbp1-u) and a stable form (Xbp1-s), plays an vital role in B cell
activation and differentiation to plasma cells. In this study, we cloned and
identified Xbp1-u gene from Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), containing 783 
bp of nucleotide sequence encoding 260 amino acids. The deduced protein possesses
a basic region leucine zipper domain (bZIP) and 26 ribonucleotides of OnXbp1-u
transcript. Transcription analysis revealed OnXbp1-u and OnXbp1-s were widely
distributed in all examined tissues, with a high expression in immune-related
tissues. When stimulated with Streptococcus agalactiae in vivo, the expressions
of OnXbp1-u and OnXbp1-s were significantly up-regulated in liver, spleen, head
kidney, blood, skin and intestine. After in vitro challenge upon S.agalactiae,
the similar up-regulations of OnXbp1-u and OnXbp1-s were also demonstrated in
head kidney leukocytes. Moreover, the OnXbp1-u and OnXbp1-s could get involved in
LPS-inducible B cell activation and (r)OnIL6-inducible B cell differentiation.
Taken together, the results indicated that OnXbp1-u and OnXbp1-s might not only
involved in the immune response against S. agalactiae challenge, but also in the 
B cell activation and differentiation in Nile tilapia.
