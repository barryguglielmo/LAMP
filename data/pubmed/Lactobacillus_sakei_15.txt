BACKGROUND: The increased prevalence of obesity has led to increases in the
prevalence of chronic diseases worldwide. There is interest whether probiotics
have an effect on obesity, but the effectiveness and safety of only a few
probiotics for the treatment of obesity have been reported. The purpose of this
study was to investigate whether ingestion of Lactobacillus sakei (CJLS03)
derived from kimchi causes weight loss in people with obesity.
METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial
involved 114 adults with a body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m2 who were assigned
randomly to a CJLS03 or placebo group. The groups received two allocations of
either 5×109 colony-forming units of CJLS03/allocation or the equivalent vehicle 
for 12 weeks. Demographic and biochemical parameters, and body composition
including fat and muscle mass were measured at baseline and after 12 weeks.
Changes in body fat, weight, and waist circumference were compared between the
two treatment groups. Adverse events were monitored during study period.
RESULTS: Body fat mass decreased by 0.2 kg in the CJLS03 group and increased by
0.6 kg in the placebo group (0.8 kg difference, P=0.018). After the 12 weeks,
waist circumference was 0.8 cm smaller in the CJLS03 group than in the placebo
group (P=0.013). BMI and body weight did not change after the 12 weeks. Adverse
events were mild and did not differ between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that L. sakei (CJLS03) might help people with
obesity reduce body fat mass without serious side effects (ClinicalTrials.gov:
NCT03248414).
