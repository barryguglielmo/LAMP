Cells (CD3+ T cell and CD68+ macrophages), cytokines (IFN-γ+ and TNF-α+) and
effector molecule (iNOS+) responses were evaluated in the lymph nodes and tissue 
of cattle naturally infected with Mycobacterium bovis Detailed post mortem and
immunohistochemical examinations of lesions were performed on 16 cows positive
for single intradermal cervical comparative tuberculin (SICCT) test which were
identified from dairy farms located around the Addis Ababa City. The severity of 
the gross lesion was significantly higher (p=0.003) in M. bovis culture positive 
(n=12) cows than in culture negative (n=4). Immunohistochemical techniques showed
that in culture positive cows, the mean immunolabeling fraction of CD3+ T cells
decreased as the stage of granuloma increased from stage I to stage IV (p<0.001).
In contrast, the immunolabelling fraction of CD68+ macrophages, IFN-γ+, TNF-α+
and iNOS+ increased from stage I to stage IV (p< 0.001). In culture negative
cows, early stages showed a significantly higher fraction of CD68+ macrophages
(p=0.03) and iNOS+ (p=0.007) when compared to culture positive cows. Similarly,
at advanced granuloma stages, culture negative cows demonstrated significantly
higher mean proportions of CD3+ T cells (p< 0.001) compared to culture positive
cows. Thus, this study demonstrates that following natural infection of cows with
M. bovis, as the stage of granuloma increases from stage I to stage IV, the
immunolabelling fraction of CD3+ cells decreases while the immunolabeling
fraction of CD68+ macrophages, IFN-γ+, TNF-α+ and iNOS+ increases.
