Objective: This study aimed to highlight the importance of mutations within
Proteus mirabilis genome that are related to fluoroquinolone resistance.
Methods: This is a cross sectional study performed in different teaching
hospitals in Khartoum State from June 2016 to May 2017. A total of (120) P
mirabilis isolates from patients with symptoms of UTIs attending different
hospitals in Khartoum State were examined. First, modified Kurby Bauer method was
performed for phenotypical detection of resistant isolates. Then polymerase chain
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) followed by
sequencing were applied for detection of mutations in GyrA, GyrB, ParC and ParE
genes of isolates.
Results: P. mirabilis showed 30% resistance to ciprofloxacin. All samples
revealed mutation at (serine 83) of GyrA and (serine 84) of ParC by Hinf1
restriction endonuclease digestion. Sequencing was performed for 12 samples. For 
each gene, two resistant and one susceptible strains were randomly selected. The 
mutations associated with ciprofloxacin resistant P. mirabilis were as follows;
(1/3) GyrA (Ser 83 to Ile) and (2/3) ParC (Ser 81 to Ile). Also it revealed
silent mutations at codons of GyrB 474 leucine (3/3), 585 valine (2/3), 612
histidine (1/3) and 639 asparagine (1/3) and ParE 469 isoleucine (2/3), 531
aspartic (2/3) and 533 glycine (1/3).
Conclusions: Ciprofloxacin resistance in P. mirabilis could be monitored through 
detection of mutations within DNA gyrase (encoded by gyrA and gyrB) and
topoisomerase IV (encoded by parC and parE).
