AIM: Here, we evaluated the performance of two commercial MALDI-TOF MS systems
and three biochemical-based systems and compared them to WGS as the gold standard
for identifying isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).
METHODS: A total of 87 VRE clinical isolates were included. The mass
spectrometers were the Microflex system with Biotyper software 3.1 and the Vitek 
MS system. The biochemical-based systems included the Vitek 2, Phoenix, and
MicroScan WalkAway systems. WGS was performed on an Illumina MiSeq instrument
using the MiSeq v3 reagent kit. Vancomycin resistance was determined according to
CLSI criteria.
RESULTS: Among the 87 VRE, 71 and 16 were identified as Enterococcus faecium and 
Enterococcus faecalis by WGS. All 71 E faecium were correctly identified by both 
mass spectrometers, as well as the Vitek 2 and Phoenix instruments. However, only
51 E faecium isolates were correctly identified by the MicroScan system. The most
frequent misidentification was Enterococcus casseliflavus (n = 20). For
vancomycin-resistant E faecium, the Microflex Biotyper system had the highest
sensitivity (85.54%), and all instruments (except for the Microscan) had a 100%
specificity and PPV. Up to 87% of E faecalis isolates were misidentified by VITEK
MS and VITEK2, 81% by Microscan and Phoenix, and 75% by Bruker biotyper.
CONCLUSION: As the coverage of type strain-genome sequence database continues to 
grow and the cost of DNA sequencing continues to decrease, genome-based
identification can be a useful tool for diagnostic laboratories, with its
superior accuracy even over MALDI-TOF and database-driven operations.
