Bacterial steroid-17,20-desmolase is a taxonomically rare enzymatic pathway that 
converts prednisone to 1,4-androstanediene-3,11,17-trione, a metabolite that
causes proliferation of prostate cancer cells.

The adrenal gland has traditionally been viewed as a source of "weak androgens"; 
however, emerging evidence indicates 11-oxy-androgens of adrenal origin are
metabolized in peripheral tissues to potent androgens. Also emerging is the role 
of gut bacteria in the conversion of C21 glucocorticoids to 11-oxygenated C19
androgens. Clostridium scindens ATCC 35,704 is a gut microbe capable of
converting cortisol into 11-oxy-androgens by cleaving the side-chain. The desA
and desB genes encode steroid-17,20-desmolase. Our prior study indicated that the
urinary tract bacterium, Propionimicrobium lymphophilum ACS-093-V-SCH5 encodes
desAB and converts cortisol to 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione. We wanted to determine
how widespread this function occurs in the human microbiome. Phylogenetic and
sequence similarity network analyses indicated that the steroid-17,20-desmolase
pathway is taxonomically rare and located in gut and urogenital microbiomes. Two 
microbes from each of these niches, C. scindens and Propionimicrobium
lymphophilum, respectively, were screened for activity against endogenous
(cortisol, cortisone, and allotetrahydrocortisol) and exogenous (prednisone,
prednisolone, dexamethasone, and 9-fluorocortisol) glucocorticoids. LC/MS
analysis showed that both microbes were able to side-chain cleave all
glucocorticoids, forming 11-oxy-androgens. Pure recombinant DesAB from C.
scindens showed the highest activity against prednisone, a commonly prescribed
glucocorticoid. In addition, 0.1 nM 1,4-androstadiene-3,11,17-trione, bacterial
side-chain cleavage product of prednisone, showed significant proliferation
relative to vehicle in androgen-dependent growth LNCaP prostate cancer cells
after 24 h (2.3 fold; P <  0.01) and 72 h (1.6 fold; P < 0.01). Taken together,
DesAB-expressing microbes may be an overlooked source of androgens in the body,
potentially contributing to various disease states, such as prostate cancer.
