We report the complete genome sequencing of novel Pseudomonas stutzeri strain
MP4687 isolated from cattle rumen. Various strains of P. stutzeri have been
reported from different environmental samples including oil-contaminated sites,
crop roots, air, and human clinical samples, but not from rumen samples, which is
being reported here for the first time. The genome of P. stutzeri MP4687 has a
single replicon, 4.75 Mb chromosome and a G + C content of 63.45%. The genome
encodes for 4,790 protein coding genes including 164 CAZymes and 345 carbohydrate
processing genes. The isolate MP4687 harbors LCB hydrolyzing potential through
endoglucanase (4.5 U/mL), xylanase (3.1 U/mL), β-glucosidase (3.3 U/mL) and
β-xylosidase (1.9 U/mL) activities. The pangenome analysis further revealed that 
MP4687 has a very high number of unique genes (>2100) compared to other P.
stutzeri genomes, which might have an important role in rumen functioning.
