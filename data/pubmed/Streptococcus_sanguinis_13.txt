Salivary peroxidase and myeloperoxidase are known to display antibacterial
activity against oral microbes, and previous indications have pointed to the
possibility that horseradish peroxidase (HRP) adsorbs onto the membrane of the
major oral streptococci, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguinis (S.
sanguinis). However, the mechanism of interaction between HRP and the bacterial
cell wall component is unclear. Dental plaques containing salivary glycoproteins 
and extracellular microbial products are visualized with 'dental plaque
disclosing agent', and are controlled within dental therapy. However, current
'dental plaque disclosing agents' are difficult to evaluate with just dental
plaques, since they stain and disclose not only dental plaques but also pellicle 
formed with salivary glycoproteins on a tooth surface. In this present study, we 
have demonstrated that HRP interacted with the cell wall component of the major
gram-positive bacterial peptidoglycan, but not the major cell wall component of
gram-negative bacteria lipopolysaccharide. Furthermore, we observed that the
adsorbed HRP labeled with fluorescence was detected on the major oral
gram-positive strains S. sanguinis and Streptococcus salivarius (S. salivarius), 
but not on a gram-negative strain, Escherichia coli (E. coli). Furthermore, we
have demonstrated that the combination of HRP and chromogenic substrate clearly
disclosed the dental plaques and the biofilm developed by S. sanguinis, S.
salivarius and the major gram-postive bacteria Lactobacillus casei on tooth
surfaces, and slightly disclosed the biofilm by E. coli. The combination of HRP
and chromogenic substrate did not stain either the dental pellicle with the
salivary glycoprotein mucin, or naked tooth surfaces. These results have
suggested the possibility that the adsorption activity of HRP not only
contributes to the evaluation of dental plaque, but that enzymatic activity of
HRP may also contribute to improve dental hygiene.
