Yeast mannan is a part of yeast cell wall and can potentially affect gut
microflora as a soluble dietary fiber. We demonstrated that yeast mannan
suppressed putrefactive production and increased the relative abundance of
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron in in vitro fecal fermentation. These results
suggest that yeast mannan can be used as a novel prebiotic food ingredient.
