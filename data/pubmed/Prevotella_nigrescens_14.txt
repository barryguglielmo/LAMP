The in vitro resistance of selected red/orange complex periodontal pathogens to
tinidazole was compared with four other antibiotics. Subgingival biofilm samples 
from 88 adults with severe periodontitis were anaerobically incubated on enriched
Brucella blood agar with and without supplementation with tinidazole (16 mg/L),
metronidazole (16 mg/L), amoxicillin (8 mg/L), doxycycline (4 mg/L), or
clindamycin (4 mg/L). Growth of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia,
Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, Parvimonas micra, Fusobacterium nucleatum,
Streptococcus constellatus, or Campylobacter rectus on antibiotic-supplemented
plates indicated their in vitro antibiotic resistance. Tinidazole inhibited all
test species, except P. intermedia/nigrescens, P. micra, and S. constellatus in
3.8%, 10.2%, and 88.9% of species-positive patients, respectively. Significantly 
fewer patients yielded tinidazole-resistant test species, and had significantly
lower subgingival proportions of tinidazole-resistant organisms, than patients
with amoxicillin, doxycycline, or clindamycin-resistant species, but not those
with metronidazole-resistant strains. Joint in vitro species resistance to
tinidazole and amoxicillin, or metronidazole and amoxicillin, was rare.
Tinidazole performed in vitro similar to metronidazole, and markedly better than 
amoxicillin, doxycycline, or clindamycin, against fresh clinical isolates of
red/orange complex periodontal pathogens. As a result of its similar
antimicrobial spectrum, and more convenient once-a-day oral dosing, tinidazole
should be considered in place of metronidazole for systemic periodontitis drug
therapy.
