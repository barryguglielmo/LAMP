Structural and biophysical characterization of molecular mechanisms of
disease-causing pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, often requires
recombinant expression of large amounts highly pure protein. For the production
of mycobacterial proteins, overexpression in the fast-growing and non-pathogenic 
species Mycobacterium smegmatis has several benefits over the standard
Escherichia coli expression strains. However, unlike for E. coli, the range of
expression vectors currently available is limited. Here we describe the
development of the pMy vector series, a set of expression plasmids for
recombinant production of single proteins and protein complexes in M. smegmatis. 
By incorporating an alternative selection marker, we show that these plasmids can
also be used for co-expression studies. All vectors in the pMy vector series are 
available in the Addgene repository (www.addgene.com). This article is protected
