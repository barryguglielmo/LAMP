Solobacterium moorei is an anaerobic gram-positive bacillus that rarely causes
bacteremia. Herein, we report a case of S. moorei bacteremia associated with
acute cholangitis in a patient without malignancy. The patient had a history of
chronic pancreatitis with pancreaticogastrostomy and presented with fever and
abdominal pain. Computed tomography scans showed acute cholangitis and S. moorei 
identified in blood cultures were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and 16S rRNA sequencing.
The patient was successfully treated with endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage 
and antibiotics including meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam.
