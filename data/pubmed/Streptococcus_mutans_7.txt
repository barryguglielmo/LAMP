OBJECTIVES: To determine salivary human neutrophil peptides 1-3 (HNP1-3) levels
in caries-free preschool children and in those with early childhood caries (ECC) 
or severe-ECC, in a daily probiotic group, receiving reconstituted milk with the 
probiotic Lactobacillus paracasei SD1 once daily; a triweekly probiotic group,
receiving the probiotic milk 3 days a week; and a placebo group.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Oral examination and unstimulated whole saliva collection 
were conducted in 354 children at baseline, 6 months after intervention (T6), and
after probiotic discontinuation (T12). Of the 354, adequate volume of saliva
samples from 268 children were simultaneously analyzed for Streptococcus mutans
and total lactobacilli levels using qPCR and for HNP1-3 levels using ELISA.
RESULTS: In the severe-ECC status, significant increases in the median HNP1-3
levels at T12 were found in both daily and triweekly probiotic groups (p <
0.001). The median S. mutans levels in the daily group were significantly
decreased at T6 and T12 (p < 0.01), whereas the median total lactobacilli levels 
were significantly increased at T6 (p < 0.001). Significantly inverse
correlations between altered HNP1-3 and S. mutans levels and significant
decreases in caries progression were found in both probiotic groups (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: In the severe-ECC status, daily or triweekly consumption of L.
paracasei SD1 significantly enhanced salivary HNP1-3 levels, but reduced S.
mutans levels, possibly resulting in reduction of caries progression.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Significant enhancement of salivary HNP1-3 levels by
probiotic consumption is associated with reduction in S. mutans levels,
consistent with diminished caries progression in children with severe-ECC.
