Mycobacterium fortuitum is a non-tuberculous rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM). 
We present a case of a 30 year old female who developed a right breast subareolar
abscess due to M. fortuitum four months after a nipple piercing. She failed to
respond to an initial three-week course of monotherapy with
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole despite aspiration of abscess and removal of
offending nipple piercing. Our patient was successfully treated with dual
antimicrobial therapy. This report also includes a brief literature review of
prior reported cases caused by this organism. It is important to keep M.
fortuitum and other RGM species on the differential if there is failure of
resolution of abscess and infection with routine antimicrobial therapy.
