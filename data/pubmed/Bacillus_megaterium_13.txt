BACKGROUND: The soybean cyst nematode (SCN, Heterodera glycines) is the most
devastating and yield-limiting pest in soybean worldwide. With the increasing
awareness of environmental protection, biological control becomes more and more
urgent. The Bacillus megaterium Sneb207 has previously shown the ability to
inhibit the movement of SCN, but little is known about its effect on nematode
control in agricultural settings. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
efficiency of Sneb207 against SCN and investigate the ability of Sneb207 to
induce systemic resistance to H. glycines in soybean.
RESULTS: The stability and efficiency of SCN control by Sneb207 was assessed in
two field experiments. Compared to non-treated control, Sneb207 significantly
reduced the number of cysts, SCN juveniles, and eggs, while it promoted soybean
growth. Furthermore, results of two pot experiments showed that the number of
initial infections of second-stage juveniles were 231.75 and 131.3 after Sneb207 
treatment, respectively, lower than control (274.75 and 215.33). Sneb207 reduced 
the total number of juveniles and females, and lengthened SCN development time.
Moreover, through the split-root system and real-time quantitative PCR
experiments, we found that Sneb207 induced systemic resistance and enhanced the
gene expression of GmACS9b, GmEDS1, GmPAD4, GmSAMT1, and GmNPR1-1 involved in the
salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and ethylene pathways at different levels.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that B. megaterium Sneb207 inhibits the
invasion, the development, and reproduction of SCN by inducing systemic
resistance. The overall outcomes of the present study support B. megaterium
Sneb207 as a potential biocontrol agent for H. glycines.
