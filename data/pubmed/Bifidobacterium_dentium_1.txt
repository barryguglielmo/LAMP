We present the draft genome sequences of two Bifidobacterium dentium strains
isolated from a fecal extract for fecal microbiota transplantation at a hospital 
in the Republic of Korea. Phylogenetic and functional analyses were performed to 
understand the physiological characteristics and functions of Bifidobacterium
spp. in the human intestine.
