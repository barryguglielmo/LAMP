The authors report a case of a premature male newborn admitted to the neonatal
intensive care unit after an emergent caesarean due to maternal pre-eclampsia and
foetal bradycardia at 32 weeks of gestational age and birth weight of 1440 g.
There were no infection risk factors reported. On day 3 his clinical condition
deteriorated, with tachycardia and subfebrile temperature and C-reactive protein 
at 1.25 mg/dL. Empirical antibiotics (flucloxacillin and gentamicin) were
started, with no clinical improvement and C-reactive protein increasing to a
maximum of 19 mg/dL (upper normal level of 1 mg/dL) after 3 days. Blood cultures 
from the third to the eighth day of life were positive for Acinetobacter ursingii
Targeted therapy was administered for 14 days with clinical and laboratorial
improvement and he was discharged on the 28th day of life without any known
sequelae. A. ursingii is emerging as an infectious agent of late-onset sepsis in 
immunosuppressed neonates.
