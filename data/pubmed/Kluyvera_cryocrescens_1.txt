OBJECTIVE: Cloning and secretory expression of an amidase from Kluyvera
cryocrescens and characterization of its potential in preparation of chiral amino
acids.
RESULTS: An amidase belonging to the Ntn-hydrolase superfamily was identified
from Kluyvera cryocrescens ZJB-17005 (Kc-Ami). The maximum activity of Kc-Ami was
observed at pH 8.5 and 55 °C. Remarkably, Kc-Ami showed an excellent
enantioselectivity (99% ee) using
rac-4-(hydroxy(methyl)phosphoryl)-2-(2-phenylacetamido) butanoic acid as
substrate. Kc-Ami remained stable at pH 7.0-9.0 and exhibited prominent
thermostability with a half-life time of 59.1, 47.4 and 20.4 h at 50, 55 and
60 °C, respectively. Kc-Ami could be appllied to synthesize chiral amino acids
and its derivatives with excellent enantioselectivity (> 99% ee). The
synthesized chiral amino acids could contain short or long side chain, and
further the side chain could be replaced with -OH, -COOH or benzene ring.
CONCLUSIONS: Kc-Ami exhibited remarkable thermostability and excellent
enantioselectivity for synthesizing chiral amino acids and its derivatives. This 
specific characteristic provides great potential for industrial application in
preparation of chiral amino acids and its derivatives.
