Kalliklectin is a unique fish-specific lectin, whose sequence is similar to the
heavy chain of mammalian plasma kallikrein and coagulation factor XI. In this
study, we aimed to evaluate dynamic expression profiles of the lectin gene,
during early developmental stages, in fugu, Takifugu rubripes. Reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that the kalliklectin
gene was not expressed until 14 h post-fertilization (hpf), while the mRNA was
detected after 30 hpf. In real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), the gene was first
expressed at 10.5 hpf; then, the expression level increased with a peak at 30 hpf
and then gradually decreased. On the other hand, western blotting with specific
antibody detected the lectin protein at all tested stages, including the
unfertilized egg, which suggests that the lectin detected in the early stages was
a maternal factor. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that kalliklectin was
localized at the basement membranes of the newly hatched larvae, while the lectin
was widely detected in epidermal cells in larva at 5 dph. A 40-kDa lectin was
partially purified from unfertilized eggs using mannose-affinity chromatography, 
and the lectin was determined as kalliklectin by liquid chromatography with
quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (LC/Q-TOF-MS) analysis, which 
indicated that the lectin is functional in the eggs. The egg lectin can bind to
Gram-positive bacterial pathogens of fish, such as Lactococcus garvieae and
Streptococcus iniae. We conclude that fugu kalliklectin might be an important
immunocomponent, transferred from mother to offspring.
