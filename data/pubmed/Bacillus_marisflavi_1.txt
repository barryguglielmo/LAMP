Background: Phenol is an aromatic pollutant in industrial wastes that in
combination with salts is highly toxic for all forms of life. Phenol elimination 
is the foremost challenge to meet the goal of pollutant-free environment.
Objective: The present study was carried out to isolate phenol degrading bacteria
which can degrade phenol under saline conditions and to identify the isolated
strains using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis.
Material and Methods: Sediment samples were collected from Rawal Lake, Islamabad,
Pakistan and enriched in mineral salt medium (MSM) containing phenol (150
mg.L-1). Isolated strains were identified on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence 
analysis. Growth of strains were tested at different pH, NaCl concentrations and 
temperature using Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA). Tolerance to phenol (0-750 mg.L-1) was 
checked at 5% NaCl and phenol degrading experiment was performed at 4% NaCl, pH 7
and 30 oC. In both, phenol tolerance and degradation study, phenol was used a
sole source of carbon and energy.
Results: Thirteen bacterial strains were isolated after enrichment among which,
NIGAB-1 was found capable of degrading phenol in saline conditions. This strain
was identified as Bacillus sp. NIGAB-1 on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence
analysis and the closest match was Bacillus marisflavi with 99.71% sequence
identity. The Bacillus sp. NIGAB-1 exhibited best growth at 30 oC at pH 7 with
10% NaCl. The optimum phenol concentration for growth was recorded as 300 mg.L-1.
This strain degraded 300 mg.L-1 of phenol at 4% NaCl in 120 hours with the
average degradation rate of 2.63 mg.L-1.h.
Conclusion: These findings suggest that this strain could be efficient in phenol 
degradation at adverse environmental conditions and helpful in remediation of
phenol where the salt concentration is high.
