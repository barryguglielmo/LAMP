BACKGROUND: Raoultella are Gram-negative rod-shaped aerobic bacteria which grow
in water and soil. They mostly cause nosocomial infections associated with
surgical procedures. This case study is the first report of a Raoultella
infection in Africa. Case presentation We report a case of a surgical site
infection (SSI) caused by Raoultella planticola which developed after caesarean
section (CS) and surgery for secondary small bowel obstruction. The patient
became febrile with neutrophilia (19,157/µL) 4 days after laparotomy and started 
to develop clinical signs of a SSI on the 8th day after laparotomy. The patient
continued to be febrile and became critically ill despite empirical treatment
with ceftriaxone and vancomycin. Raoultella species with extended antimicrobial
resistance (AMR) carrying the CTX-M-9 β-lactamase was isolated from the wound
discharge. Considering the antimicrobial susceptibility test, ceftriaxone was
replaced by ceftazidime. The patient recovered and could be discharged on day 29 
after CS.
CONCLUSIONS: Raoultella planticola was isolated from an infected surgical site
after repeated abdominal surgery. Due to the infection the patient's stay in the 
hospital was prolonged for a total of 4 weeks. It is noted that patients
undergoing surgical and prolonged inpatient treatment are at risk for infections 
caused by Raoultella. The development of a SSI caused by Raoultella planticola
with extended AMR has to be assumed to be a consequence of ineffective antibiotic
utilization. The presented case advices that rare bacteria as Raoultella should
be considered as potential cause of nosocomial SSI with challenging treatment due
to high levels of AMR.
