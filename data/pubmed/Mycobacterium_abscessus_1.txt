Background: Due to increasing multidrug-resistant (MDR) infections, there is an
interest in assessing the use of bacteriophage therapy (BT) as an antibiotic
alternative. After the first successful case of intravenous BT to treat a
systemic MDR infection at our institution in 2017, the Center for Innovative
Phage Applications and Therapeutics (IPATH) was created at the University of
California, San Diego, in June 2018.
Methods: We reviewed IPATH consult requests from June 1, 2018, to April 30, 2020,
and reviewed the regulatory process of initiating BT on a compassionate basis in 
the United States. We also reviewed outcomes of the first 10 cases at our center 
treated with intravenous BT (from April 1, 2017, onwards).
Results: Among 785 BT requests to IPATH, BT was administered to 17 of 119
patients in whom it was recommended. One-third of requests were for Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycobacterium abscessus. Intravenous BT
was safe with a successful outcome in 7/10 antibiotic-recalcitrant infections at 
our center (6 were before IPATH). BT may be safely self-administered by
outpatients, used for infection suppression/prophylaxis, and combined
successfully with antibiotics despite antibiotic resistance, and phage resistance
may be overcome with new phage(s). Failure occurred in 2 cases despite in vitro
phage susceptibility.
Conclusions: We demonstrate the safety and feasibility of intravenous BT for a
variety of infections and discuss practical considerations that will be critical 
for informing future clinical trials.
