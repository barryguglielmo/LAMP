Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 is a known polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB)-producing
microorganism that possesses genes associated with PHB synthesis such as PhaA,
PhaB, and PHA synthases. PhaA (i.e., thiolase) is the first enzyme in the PHA
biosynthetic pathway, which catalyze the condensation of two acetyl-CoA molecules
to acetoacetyl-CoA. Our study elucidated the crystal structure of PhaA in
Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 (BcTHL) in its apo- and CoA-bound forms. BcTHL adopts 
a type II biosynthetic thiolase structure by forming a tetramer. The crystal
structure of CoA-complexed BcTHL revealed that the substrate binding site of
BcTHL is constituted by different residues compared with other known thiolases.
Our study also revealed that Arg221, a residue involved in ADP binding, undergoes
a positional conformational change upon the binding of the CoA molecule.
