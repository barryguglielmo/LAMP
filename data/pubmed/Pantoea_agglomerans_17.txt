Bioaerosols containing pathogens released from wastewater will pose potential
health risks to workers on site. The emission of airborne bacteria from a rural
wastewater treatment station and their inactivation by ultraviolet were
investigated in this study. High-throughput sequencing technique was utilized to 
assay airborne bacterial population while the health risks associated with
airborne bacteria exposure were estimated based on average daily dose rates. The 
recorded emission level of airborne bacteria in the air surrounding the
multi-point inlet contact oxidation bioreactor (MTB) was 4795 ± 1475 CFU/m3,
containing 2233 ± 471 CFU/m3 of intestinal bacteria, and most of them (70.3%) was
coarse particles with size over 2.1 μm. Wind disturbance had significant effects 
on the diffusion and particle size distribution of the bioaerosols emitted from
MTB. The identified opportunistic pathogens in bioaerosols were Enterobacter sp.,
Acinetobacter sp., Pantoea sp., Achromobacter sp., and Curtobacterium sp. They
were originated in the water and active sludge in MTB. Inhalation was one of the 
main ways through which onsite workers were exposed to airborne bacteria.
Exposure to ultraviolet radiation caused an apparent decrease in the level of
bioaerosols in the air, thereby indicating that it can be utilized as an
effective method for the reducing of bioaerosols. This study aims to provide
preliminary data for the bioaerosols control in rural wastewater treatment
process.
