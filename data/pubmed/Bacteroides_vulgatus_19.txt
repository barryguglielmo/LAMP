Inflammatory bowel diseases are associated with complex shifts in microbiota
composition. However, it remains unclear whether specific subsets of commensal
bacteria induce inflammatory bowel diseases in genetically susceptible hosts. In 
this study, we found that deficiency of the E3 ligase Itch, which leads to
spontaneous colitis and rectal prolapse, is associated with alteration of the gut
microbiota. 16S rRNA sequencing showed expansion of colitogenic Bacteroides sp.
in Itch-/- mice. Treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics substantially reduced 
colonic inflammation in Itch-/- mice. Microbiota of Itch-/- mice failed to induce
spontaneous colitis upon transfer to Itch+/+ mice but aggravated chemically
induced colitis. Furthermore, we found that Bacteroides vulgatus, which is
expanded in Itch-/- mice, was sufficient to induce colon inflammation in Itch-/- 
mice.
