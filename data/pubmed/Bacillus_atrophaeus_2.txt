Remediation and recovery efforts after a release of Bacillus anthracis (anthrax) 
spores may be difficult and costly. In addition, response and recovery
technologies may be focused on critical resources, leaving the small business or 
homeowner without remediation options. This study evaluates the efficacy of
relatively low levels of hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV) delivered from
off-the-shelf equipment for the inactivation of Bacillus spores within an indoor 
environment. Decontamination evaluations were conducted in a house using both
Bacillus atrophaeus var. globigii (Bg; as surrogates for B. anthracis )
inoculated on the carpet and galvanized metal as coupons and Geobacillus
stearothermophilus (Gs) as biological indicators on steel. The total
decontamination time ranged from 4 to 7 days. Using the longer exposure times,
low concentrations of HPV (average levels below 20 parts per million) effectively
inactivated Bg and Gs spores on the materials tested. The HPV was generated with 
commercial humidifiers and household-strength hydrogen peroxide solutions. The
presence of home furnishings did not have a significant impact on HPV efficacy.
This simple, inexpensive, and effective decontamination method could have
significant utility for remediation following a B. anthracis spore release, such 
as following a terrorist attack.
