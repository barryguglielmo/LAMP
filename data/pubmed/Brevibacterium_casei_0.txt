Brevibacteria are a part of the normal skin flora and may be dismissed in blood
cultures as contaminants. They have been reported as opportunistic pathogens in
immunocompromised patients. We report a catheter-related bloodstream infection
with Brevibacterium casei in a 6-year-old child with aplastic anaemia. Treatment 
with appropriate antibiotics along with the removal of the catheter resulted in
complete cure in our patient.
