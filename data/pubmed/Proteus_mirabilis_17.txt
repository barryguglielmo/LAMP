Thymus algeriensis Bioss & Reut is an Algerian native plant traditionally used
for culinary and medicinal purposes. To evaluate the in vivo antioxidant and
antimicrobial properties of T. algeriensis, phenolic compounds were extracted
using hydromethanolic solutions and administrated to Swiss albinos mice. It was
observed that the plasma antioxidant capacity increased, as well as catalase and 
glutathione levels, whereas malondialdehyde decreased. In vitro assays confirmed 
that the extract scavenged 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, DPPH• (7 µg/mL),
chelated (EC50: 512 µg/mL) and reduced iron ions (5.3 mM FeSO4/g), and inhibited 
β-carotene bleaching (90% at 2 mg/mL). Antibacterial effects were also observed
towards Salmonella typhimurium and Proteus mirabilis. However, the methanolic
fraction obtained by reversed solid phase cartridge, showed antibacterial
activity against Escherichia coli (MIC = 9.37 mg/mL), Proteus mirabilis
(MIC = 4.68 mg/mL), Salmonella typhimurium (MIC = 7.06 mg/mL), Micrococcus luteus
(MIC = 7.03 mg/mL), and Bacillus cereus (MIC = 2.34 mg/mL). UHPLC-DAD-ESI-MSn
analysis showed that these properties could result from rosmarinic acid, caffeoyl
rosmaniric acid, and kaempferol and eriodictyol glycoside derivatives. These
results pave the way for the understanding of T. algeriensis traditional
applications and its use for the development of novel food applications.
