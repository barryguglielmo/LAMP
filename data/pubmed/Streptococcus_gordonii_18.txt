Streptococcus mutans is an oral species closely associated with dental caries. As
an early oral colonizer, S. mutans utilizes interspecies coaggregation to promote
the colonization of subsequent species and affect polymicrobial pathogenesis.
Previous studies have confirmed several adhering partner species of S. mutans,
including Candida albicans and Fusobacterium nucleatum. In this study, we
discovered new intergeneric co-adherence between S. mutans and the saliva isolate
Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS-SI101). Research shows that GBS typically colonizes
the human gastrointestinal and vaginal tracts. It is responsible for adverse
pregnancy outcomes and life-threatening infections in neonates and
immunocompromised people. Our results revealed that GtfB and GtfC of S. mutans,
which contributed to extracellular polysaccharide synthesis, promoted
coaggregation of S. mutans with GBS-SI101. In addition, oral streptococci,
including Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus gordonii and S. mutans, barely
inhibited the growth of GBS-SI101. This study indicated that S. mutans could help
GBS integrate into the Streptococcus-associated oral polymicrobial community and 
become a resident species in the oral cavity, increasing the risk of oral
infections.
