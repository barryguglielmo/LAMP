Resistant starch (RS) is a complex prebiotic carbohydrate beneficial to the human
gut. In the present study, four genes encoding for putative amylolytic enzymes,
likely to be responsible for RS-degradation, were identified in the genome of
Bifidobacterium adolescentis P2P3 by comparative genomic analysis. Our results
showed that only three enzymes (RSD1, RSD2, and RSD3) exhibited non-gelatinized
high amylose corn starch (HACS)-degrading activity in addition to typical
α-amylase activity. These three RS-degrading enzymes (RSD) were composed of
multiple domains, including signal peptide, catalytic domain, carbohydrate
binding domains, and putative cell wall-anchoring domains. Typical catalytic
domains were conserved by exhibiting seven typical conserved regions (I-VII)
found mostly in α-amylases. Analysis of enzymatic activity revealed that RSD2
displayed stronger activity toward HACS-granules than RSD1 and RSD3. Comparative 
genomics in combination with enzymatic experiments confirmed that RSDs might be
the key enzymes used by RS-degrading bifidobacteria to degrade RS in a particular
ecological niche, such as the human gut.
