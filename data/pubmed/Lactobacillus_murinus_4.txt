To investigate the characteristics of the intestinal microbiota of mice treated
with Folium senna decoction gavage combined with restraint and tail pinch stress.
Ten healthy male Kunming mice were chosen and randomly divided into control group
and model group, with five mice in each group. Mice in the control group were
raised regularly, while mice in the model group were treated by feeding with
Folium senna decoction, restraint in a constraint tube and tail pinch with a clip
for 7 days. Intestinal contents from the jejunum to ileum were collected, and DNA
was extracted from each mouse. The characteristics of the intestinal microbial
species were analysed by PacBio Sequel-based 16S rRNA sequencing. Result showed
that alpha diversity indices in the model group were higher than those in the
control group, and the Simpson index differed significantly (P < 0.05). Based on 
the composition and abundances of species, there were differences between the
control group and model group at the species level, but these differences were
not significant (P > 0.05). In the control group, Candidatus arthromitus sp.
SFB-mouse and Lactobacillus johnsonii were the dominant species. In the model
group, Staphylococcus lentus, Lactobacillus johnsonii, Candidatus arthromitus sp.
SFB-mouse and Lactobacillus murinus were included. Furthermore, LEfSe analysis
showed that the relative abundances of Escherichia sp. BBDP27, Helicobacter
ganmani, Bacteroides vulgatus and Lactobacillus intestinalis in the model group
were higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). In
conclusion, Folium senna decoction gavage combined with restraint and tail pinch 
stress increased the intestinal microbiota diversity. Strains associated with
intestinal diseases, including Bacteroides vulgatus, Helicobacter ganmani,
Staphylococcus lentus and Lactobacillus murinus, were significantly enriched,
while strains beneficial to health, such as Candidatus arthromitus sp. SFB-mouse 
and Lactobacillus johnsonii, were significantly depleted.
