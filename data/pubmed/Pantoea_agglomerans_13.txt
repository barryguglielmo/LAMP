Membrane organization plays an important role in signaling, transport, and
defense. In eukaryotes, the stability, organization, and function of membrane
proteins are influenced by certain lipids and sterols, such as cholesterol.
Bacteria lack cholesterol, but carotenoids and hopanoids are predicted to play a 
similar role in modulating membrane properties. We have previously shown that the
loss of carotenoids in the plant-associated bacteria Pantoea sp. YR343 results in
changes to membrane biophysical properties and leads to physiological changes,
including increased sensitivity to reactive oxygen species, reduced
indole-3-acetic acid secretion, reduced biofilm and pellicle formation, and
reduced plant colonization. Here, using whole cell and membrane proteomics, we
show that the deletion of carotenoid production in Pantoea sp. YR343 results in
altered membrane protein distribution and abundance. Moreover, we observe
significant differences in the protein composition of detergent-resistant
membrane fractions from wildtype and mutant cells, consistent with the prediction
that carotenoids play a role in organizing membrane microdomains. These data
provide new insights into the function of carotenoids in bacterial membrane
organization and identify cellular functions that are affected by the loss of
carotenoids.
