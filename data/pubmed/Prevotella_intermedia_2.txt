Knowledge of microbial composition and antimicrobials' susceptibility to
periodontal abscesses is vital for their successful treatment. The current study 
aims to provide a thorough overview of the clinical and microbial features of
periodontal abscesses of the local community. The study was carried out at Rehman
College of Dentistry, Peshawar, Pakistan between December 2019 to March 2020.
Clinical measurements and microbial samples were collected from 45 subjects.
Microbial samples were anaerobically cultured for the growth of selected
bacterial species. E-test was used to assess the susceptibility of bacterial
species grown from the patient samples to amoxicillin, azithromycin,
metronidazole, and tetracycline. The majority of affected patients had
preexisting chronic periodontitis. All abscesses clinically demonstrated bleeding
on probing and suppuration. The periodontal abscess was most commonly associated 
with lower incisors and canines, followed by lower molars and then upper incisor 
and canine teeth. Fusobacterium spp. (73%) was the most frequently detected
species followed by Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (65%), Porphyromonas
gingivalis (46%) and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (24%). The detected
clinical isolates of certain bacteria demonstrated resistance to all tested
antibiotics except azithromycin. We conclude that Fusobacterium spp., P.
intermedia/nigrescens, P. gingivalis, C. rectus, T. forsythia and A.
actinomycetemcomitans are closely associated with periodontal abscess. Bacterial 
species associated with periodontal abscess demonstrated some level of
antimicrobial resistance to amoxicillin, metronidazole and tetracycline while
antibiotic resistance to azithromycin could not be demonstrated.
