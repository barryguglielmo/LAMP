OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to assess the effect of a novel postbiotic on
bacterial community composition and structure within the intestinal ecosystem of 
rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), as well as evaluate its capacity to protect 
rainbow trout from Lactococcus garvieae infection.
RESULTS: After 30 days of dietary postbiotic supplementation, high-throughput 16S
rRNA gene sequencing revealed that bacterial community composition, diversity and
richness were significantly higher in treated fish than in control fish. The
proportion of sequences affiliated to the phylum Tenericutes, and to a lesser
extent, the phyla Spirochaetes and Bacteroidetes was increased in fish fed a
postbiotic-enriched diet compared to control fish, whereas the abundance of
Fusobacteria was higher in control fish. Moreover, the treated fish showed
significantly (p < 0.05) improved protection against L. garvieae compared to
control fish.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that dietary postbiotic supplementation may
represent an environmentally friendly strategy for preventing and controlling
diseases in aquaculture.
