BACKGROUND: Chronic pulmonary infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the
most important causes of mortality and morbidity in cystic fibrosis. If
antibiotics are commenced promptly, infection can be eradicated. The aim of the
trial was to compare the effectiveness and safety of intravenous ceftazidime and 
tobramycin versus oral ciprofloxacin in the eradication of P aeruginosa.
METHODS: We did a multicentre, parallel group, open-label, randomised controlled 
trial in 72 cystic fibrosis centres (70 in the UK and two in Italy). Eligible
participants were older than 28 days with an isolate of P aeruginosa (either the 
first ever isolate or a new isolate after at least 1 year free of infection).
Participants were excluded if the P aeruginosa was resistant to, or they had a
contraindication to, one or more of the trial antibiotics; if they were already
receiving P aeruginosa suppressive therapy; if they had received any P aeruginosa
eradication therapy within the previous 9 months; or if they were pregnant or
breastfeeding. We used web-based randomisation to assign patients to 14 days
intravenous ceftazidime and tobramycin or 12 weeks oral ciprofloxacin. Both were 
combined with 12 weeks inhaled colistimethate sodium. Randomisation lists were
generated by a statistician, who had no involvement in the trial, using a
computer-generated list. Randomisation was stratified by centre and because of
the nature of the interventions, blinding was not possible. Our primary outcome
was eradication of P aeruginosa at 3 months and remaining free of infection to 15
months. Primary analysis used intention to treat (powered for superiority).
Safety analysis included patients who received at least one dose of study drug.
TORPEDO-CF was registered on the ISRCTN register, ISRCTN02734162, and EudraCT,
2009-012575-10.
FINDINGS: Between Oct 5, 2010, and Jan 27, 2017, 286 patients were randomly
assigned to treatment: 137 to intravenous antibiotics and 149 to oral
antibiotics. 55 (44%) of 125 participants in the intravenous group and 68 (52%)
of 130 participants in the oral group achieved the primary outcome. Participants 
randomly assigned to the intravenous group were less likely to achieve the
primary outcome, although the difference between groups was not statistically
significant (relative risk 0·84, 95% CI 0·65-1·09; p=0·18). 11 serious adverse
events occurred in ten (8%) of 126 participants in the intravenous antibiotics
group and 17 serious adverse events in 12 (8%) of 146 participants in the oral
antibiotics group.
INTERPRETATION: Compared with oral therapy, intravenous antibiotics did not
achieve sustained eradication of P aeruginosa in a greater proportion of patients
with cystic fibrosis and was more expensive. Although there were fewer
hospitalisations in the intravenous group than the oral group during follow-up,
this confers no advantage over oral treatment because intravenous eradication
frequently requires hospitalisation. These results do not support the use of
intravenous antibiotics to eradicate P aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis.
