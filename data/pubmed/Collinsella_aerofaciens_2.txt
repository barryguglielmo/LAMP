OBJECTIVE: Although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
RNA was detected in faeces of patients with COVID-19, the activity and
infectivity of the virus in the GI tract during disease course is largely
unknown. We investigated temporal transcriptional activity of SARS-CoV-2 and its 
association with longitudinal faecal microbiome alterations in patients with
COVID-19.
DESIGN: We performed RNA shotgun metagenomics sequencing on serial faecal viral
extractions from 15 hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Sequencing coverage of
the SARS-CoV-2 genome was quantified. We assessed faecal microbiome composition
and microbiome functionality in association with signatures of faecal SARS-CoV-2 
infectivity.
RESULTS: Seven (46.7%) of 15 patients with COVID-19 had stool positivity for
SARS-CoV-2 by viral RNA metagenomic sequencing. Even in the absence of GI
manifestations, all seven patients showed strikingly higher coverage (p=0.0261)
and density (p=0.0094) of the 3' vs 5' end of SARS-CoV-2 genome in their faecal
viral metagenome profile. Faecal viral metagenome of three patients continued to 
display active viral infection signature (higher 3' vs 5' end coverage) up to
6 days after clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory samples. Faecal samples
with signature of high SARS-CoV-2 infectivity had higher abundances of bacterial 
species Collinsella aerofaciens, Collinsella tanakaei, Streptococcus infantis,
Morganella morganii, and higher functional capacity for nucleotide de novo
biosynthesis, amino acid biosynthesis and glycolysis, whereas faecal samples with
signature of low-to-none SARS-CoV-2 infectivity had higher abundances of
short-chain fatty acid producing bacteria, Parabacteroides merdae, Bacteroides
stercoris, Alistipes onderdonkii and Lachnospiraceae bacterium 1_1_57FAA.
CONCLUSION: This pilot study provides evidence for active and prolonged
'quiescent' GI infection even in the absence of GI manifestations and after
recovery from respiratory infection of SARS-CoV-2. Gut microbiota of patients
with active SARS-CoV-2 GI infection was characterised by enrichment of
opportunistic pathogens, loss of salutary bacteria and increased functional
capacity for nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism.
