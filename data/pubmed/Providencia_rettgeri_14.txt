Whole-genome sequence analysis was performed on a multidrug-resistant Providencia
rettgeri PR002 clinical strain isolated from the urine of a hospitalized patient 
in Pretoria, South Africa, in 2013. The resistome, mobilome, pathogenicity
island(s), as well as virulence and heavy-metal resistance genes of the isolate, 
were characterized using whole-genome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis.
PR002 had a genome assembly size of 4,832,624 bp with a GC content of 40.7%, an
A/C2 plasmid replicase gene, four integrons/gene cassettes, 17 resistance genes, 
and several virulence and heavy metal resistance genes, confirming PR002 as a
human pathogen. A novel integron, In1483, harboring the gene blaOXA-2 , was
identified, with other uncharacterized class 1 integrons harboring aacA4cr and
dfrA1. Aac(3')-IIa and blaSCO-1 , as well as blaPER-7 , sul2, and tet(B), were
found bracketed by composite Tn3 transposons, and IS91, IS91, and IS4 family
insertion sequences, respectively. PR002 was resistant to all antibiotics tested 
except amikacin, carbapenems, cefotaxime-clavulanate, ceftazidime-clavulanate,
cefoxitin, and fosfomycin. PR002 was closely related to PR1 (USA), PRET_2032
(SPAIN), DSM_1131, and NCTC7477 clinical P. rettgeri strains, but not close
enough to suggest it was imported into South Africa from other countries.
Multidrug resistance in P. rettgeri is rare, particularly in clinical settings,
making this case an important incident requiring urgent attention. This is also
the first report of an A/C plasmid in P. rettgeri. The array, multiplicity, and
diversity of resistance and virulence genes in this strain are concerning,
necessitating stringent infection control, antibiotic stewardship, and periodic
resistance surveillance/monitoring policies to preempt further horizontal and
vertical spread of these resistance genes.
