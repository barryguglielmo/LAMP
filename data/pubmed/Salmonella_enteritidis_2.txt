Early references of emphysematous osteomyelitis (EO) in the literature trace back
to 1981, when the presence of intraosseous gas was mentioned in a paper of Ram et
al.. Subsequently, 48 cases of EO were described. A significant underlying
comorbidity was reported in most EO cases, especially diabetes and malignancy.
This report presents a 37-year-old male with undiagnosed diabetes mellitus which 
was accompanied by emphysematous osteomyelitis of both femoral heads.
