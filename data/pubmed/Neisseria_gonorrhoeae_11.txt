OBJECTIVES: Young women in sub-Saharan Africa are at high risk of STIs and
unintended pregnancies, yet hormonal contraceptive (HC) use may affect STI risk. 
We compared the influence of three HCs on the incidence and prevalence of STIs
and bacterial vaginosis (BV) in South African adolescents.
METHODS: One hundred and thirty adolescents between 15 and 19 years were
randomised to the injectable norethisterone enanthate (Net-En), combined oral
contraceptives (COC) (Triphasil or Nordette) or a combined contraceptive vaginal 
ring (CCVR; NuvaRing) for 16 weeks (clinicaltrials.gov/NCT02404038). Vaginal
samples were collected at baseline and 16 weeks post contraceptive initiation for
STI and BV testing.
RESULTS: In an intention-to-treat analysis, no significant differences in BV
prevalence were found between study arms. The overall incidence of any STI at
follow-up was high: 16.2% in the COC arm; 25.7% in the Net-En arm; and 37.1% in
the CCVR arm. The incidence rate (IR) of any STI was similar between Net-En (IR
0.74 (95% CI 0.34 to 1.41)) and the oestrogen-containing contraceptives (IR 0.78 
(95% CI 0.47 to 1.22)). A lower IR of Chlamydia trachomatis (incidence rate ratio
(IRR) 0.68 (95% CI 0.19 to 1.99)) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (IRR 0.25 (95% CI
0.01 to 1.35)) but a higher IR of Mycoplasma genitalium (IRR 16.0 (95% CI 2.96 to
400)), was observed in the Net-En arm compared with the oestrogen-containing
contraceptives, although the overall incidence of M. genitalium was low (4.7%).
In an exploratory analysis, the risk of any STI and N. gonorrhoeae was lower in
the COC arm compared with CCVR. A per-protocol analysis yielded similar results.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that use of Net-En may be associated with
increased risk of M. genitalium compared with oestrogen-containing contraceptives
but not with overall STI risk. COC use may decrease STI risk relative to CCVR.
