Cancer patients experience a cluster of co-occurring psychoneurological symptoms 
(PNS) related to cancer treatments. The gut microbiome may affect severity of the
PNS via neural, immune, and endocrine signaling pathways. However, the link
between the gut microbiome and PNS has not been well investigated in cancer
patients, including those with head and neck cancers (HNCs). This pilot study
enrolled 13 patients with HNCs, who reported PNS using the Patient-Reported
Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAEs). 
Stool specimens were collected to analyze patients' gut microbiome. All data were
collected pre- and post-radiation therapy (RT). Associations between the
bacterial abundances and the PNS clusters were analyzed using the linear
discriminant analysis effect size; functional pathway analyses of 16S rRNA V3-V4 
bacterial communities were conducted using Tax4fun. The high PNS cluster had a
greater decrease in microbial evenness than the low PNS cluster from pre- to
post-RT. The high and low PNS clusters showed significant differences using
weighted UniFrac distance. Those individuals with the high PNS cluster were more 
likely to have higher abundances in phylum Bacteroidetes, order Bacteroidales,
class Bacteroidia, and four genera (Ruminiclostridium9, Tyzzerella,
Eubacterium_fissicatena, and DTU089), while the low PNS cluster had higher
abundances in family Acidaminococcaceae and three genera (Lactococcus,
Phascolarctobacterium, and Desulfovibrio). Both glycan metabolism
(Lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis) and vitamin metabolism (folate biosynthesis and
lipoic acid metabolism) were significantly different between the high and low PNS
clusters pre- and post-RT. Our preliminary data suggest that the diversity and
abundance of the gut microbiome play a potential role in developing PNS among
cancer patients.
