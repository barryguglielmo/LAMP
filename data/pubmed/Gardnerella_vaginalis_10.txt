Background: Vaginal or genitourinary infections are a major cause of morbidity,
sterility, and increase in the vulnerability to cancers and HIV/AIDS infection.
The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of vaginal infections of C.
albicans, G. vaginalis, and T. vaginalis among women in the locality of Dschang, 
West Region of Cameroon.
Method: A prospective study was carried out in the District Hospital of Dschang. 
After obtaining informed consent, one thousand and one (1001) samples of vaginal 
swabs were collected. Biological diagnosis was carried out on fresh samples, Gram
stained, and then cultivated in Sabouraud agar in a Petri dish, in order to
isolate and identify the various infectious agents.
Results: Five hundred and twenty-five (525) women were diagnosed positive,
hosting at least one of these microorganisms, making an overall prevalence of
52.44%. Two hundred and fifty-six (256) women (25.57%) were infected with C.
albicans, and 171 (17.08%) with G. vaginalis. Ninety-five (9.49%) were infected
with both C. albicans and G. vaginalis, 2 (0.20%) with C. albicans and T.
vaginalis, and 1 (0.1%) with G. vaginalis and T. vaginalis.
Conclusion: Drastic measures should be taken in order to improve life styles to
regress the frequency of these infections. Results obtained in this study, will
help to educate and shed more light on the prevalence of vaginal infections in
the West Region of Cameroon.
