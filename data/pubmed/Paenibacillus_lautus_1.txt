Bacteria frequently adapt to high osmolarity surroundings through the
accumulation of compatible solutes. Ectoine is a prominent member of these types 
of stress protectants and is produced via an evolutionarily conserved
biosynthetic pathway beginning with the L-2,4-diaminobutyrate (DAB) transaminase 
(TA) EctB. Here, we studied EctB from the thermo-tolerant Gram-positive bacterium
Paenibacillus lautus (Pl) and show that this tetrameric enzyme is highly tolerant
to salt, pH, and temperature. During ectoine biosynthesis, EctB converts
L-glutamate and L-aspartate-beta-semialdehyde into 2-oxoglutarate and DAB, but it
also catalyzes the reverse reaction. Our analysis unravels that EctB enzymes are 
mechanistically identical to the PLP-dependent gamma-aminobutyrate TAs (GABA-TAs)
and only differ with respect to substrate binding. Inspection of the genomic
context of the ectB gene in P. lautus identifies an unusual arrangement of
juxtapositioned genes for ectoine biosynthesis and import via an Ehu-type
binding-protein-dependent ABC transporter. This operon-like structure suggests
the operation of a highly coordinated system for ectoine synthesis and import to 
maintain physiologically adequate cellular ectoine pools under osmotic stress
conditions in a resource-efficient manner. Taken together, our study provides an 
in-depth mechanistic and physiological description of EctB, the first enzyme of
the ectoine biosynthetic pathway.
