Timing of entry of Streptococcus uberis into the mammary gland of the dairy cow.

Streptococcus uberis do not colonise the teat canal and appear to invade the
mammary gland of the dairy cow by direct entry though the canal. When they enter 
the mammary gland, and the early resulting processes, are unclear. Experimental
infusions of the lactating mammary gland have been made to determine outcomes of 
infection, mastitis and disease. Infusion of 500 cfu bacteria was made
immediately after milking (8 and 16 h intermilking interval) and 1, 4 or 12 h
prior to milking. A mastitis resulted from all infusions, probably in response to
the skim milk carrier. Infusions post milking resulted in clinical mastitis in
more than half of the quarters, whereas infusion 1 h premilking created no
clinical mastitis. Infusion 4 or 12 h pre milking resulted in the most severe
reactions, with all quarters developing moderate to severe clinical mastitis.
This was more rapid with the 4 h pre milking group. The results demonstrate that 
the initial inflammatory response caused by an invasion of the mammary gland is
not necessarily protective against establishment of a pathogen, and that
especially the response to invasion in the intermilking interval is often
insufficient to prevent infection and/or disease.
