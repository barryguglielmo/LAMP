Biosurfactants offer numerous advantages over the chemical surfactants,
especially in energy and environment-related applications. Microbial enhanced oil
recovery (MEOR) is a technique to recover oil from reservoirs by using microbes
and their metabolites. In present study, total sixteen morphologically distinct
bacterial strains isolated from different salty areas of the district Khairpur
Mir's, Pakistan, were investigated for their MEOR potential. Screening assays for
thermotolerance and halotolerance declared 7 out of 16 (43.75%) bacterial
isolates as thermotolerant (capable of growing in the temperature range 60-70 °C)
and halotolerant (tolerating NaCl concentrations up to 17%, w/v). Moreover, five 
of them were screened as biosurfactant producers. Among, the lowest surface
tension reduction was achieved with biosurfactants produced by the strains KJ2MO 
(27.8 mN/m) and KJ2SK (29.3 mN/m). The biosurfactant activity was found stable at
temperature (100-121 °C, 1 h) and pH (4-10). Moreover, maximum oil recovery was
obtained with biosurfactant of bacterial strain KJ2MO (54.7%, 51.25%) followed by
KJ2SK (44.7%, 40.5%), KJ1WB (37%, 35.5%) and KJ2MD (37.8%, 31.9%) by using either
techniques, i.e., soil washing and sand-packed column, respectively. Moreover,
the potent species were identified as Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes KJ1WB,
Bacillus aerius KJ2MD, Bacillus licheniformis KJ2SK, and Bacillus subtilis KJ2MO 
using 16S rRNA ribo-typing. The investigated species were found to be promising
biosurfactants producers having potential for enhanced oil recovery and could be 
used in other environmental applications like bioremediation.
