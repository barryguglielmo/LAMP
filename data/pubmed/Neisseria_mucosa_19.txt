Neisseria meningitidis is an inhabitant of the nasopharynx, from which it is
transmitted from person to person or disseminates in blood and becomes a harmful 
pathogen. In this work, we addressed colonization of the nasopharyngeal niche by 
focusing on the interplay between meningococci and the airway mucus that lines
the mucosa of the host. Using Calu-3 cells grown in air interface culture (cells 
grown with the apical domain facing air), we studied meningococcal colonization
of the mucus and the host response. Our results suggested that N. meningitidis
behaved like commensal bacteria in mucus, without interacting with human cells or
actively transmigrating through the cell layer. As a result, type IV pili do not 
play a role in this model, and meningococci did not trigger a strong innate
immune response from the Calu-3 cells. Finally, we have shown that this model is 
suitable for studying interaction of N. meningitidis with other bacteria living
in the nasopharynx and that Streptococcus mitis, but not Moraxella catarrhalis,
can promote meningococcal growth in this model.IMPORTANCE N. meningitidis is
transmitted from person to person by aerosol droplets produced by breathing,
talking, or coughing or by direct contact with a contaminated fluid. The natural 
reservoir of N. meningitidis is the human nasopharynx mucosa, located at the back
of the nose and above the oropharynx. The means by which meningococci cross the
nasopharyngeal wall is still under debate, due to the lack of a convenient and
relevant model mimicking the nasopharyngeal niche. Here, we took advantage of
Calu-3 cells grown in air interface culture to study how meningococci colonize
the nasopharyngeal niche. We report that the airway mucus is both a niche for
meningococcal growth and a protective barrier against N. meningitidis infection. 
As such, N. meningitidis behaves like commensal bacteria and is unlikely to
induce infection without an external trigger.
