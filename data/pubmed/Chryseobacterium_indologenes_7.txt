Septicaemia likely results in high case-fatality rates in the present
multidrug-resistant (MDR) era. Amongst them are hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)
and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), two frequent fatal septicaemic
entities amongst hospitalised patients. We reviewed the PubMed database to
identify the common organisms implicated in HAP/VAP, to explore the respective
risk factors, and to find the appropriate antibiotic choice. Apart from
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae spp., MDR or
extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-Acinetobacter baumannii complex spp., followed
by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Chryseobacterium indologenes, and
Elizabethkingia meningoseptica are ranked as the top Gram-negative bacteria (GNB)
implicated in HAP/VAP. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae notably emerged as
an important concern in HAP/VAP. The above-mentioned pathogens have respective
risk factors involved in their acquisition. In the present XDR era, tigecycline, 
colistin, and ceftazidime-avibactam are antibiotics effective against the
Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase and oxacillinase producers amongst the
Enterobacteriaceae isolates implicated in HAP/VAP. Antibiotic combination
regimens are recommended in the treatment of MDR/XDR-P. aeruginosa or A.
baumannii complex isolates. Some special patient populations need prolonged
courses (>7-day) and/or a combination regimen of antibiotic therapy.
Implementation of an antibiotic stewardship policy and the measures recommended
by the United States (US) Institute for Healthcare were shown to decrease the
incidence rates of HAP/VAP substantially.
