Rind color of some high-value PDO cheeses is related to the presence of
carotenoids, but little is known about the structure of the pigmented compounds
and their origin. Our objective was to describe the carotenoids extracted from
the rind of a French cheese, Fourme de Montbrison, and to compare them with the
pigments produced by a bacterial strain used as an adjunct culture in the cheese 
ripening process. Eleven carotenoids were detected in the cheese rinds or in the 
biomass of Brevibacterium linens. Most of the carotenoids from the rinds belonged
to the aryl (aromatic) carotenoid family, including hydroxylated and
non-hydroxylated isorenieratene. Chlorobactene, a carotenoid rarely found in food
products, was also detected. Agelaxanthin A was identified in the cheese rinds as
well as in the B. linens biomass. Occurrence of this compound was previously
described in only one scientific publication, where it was isolated from the
sponge Agela schmidtii.
