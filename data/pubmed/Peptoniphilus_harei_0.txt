BACKGROUND: Peptoniphilus species are Gram-positive anaerobic cocci that are
commensals of the human vagina and gut.Methods and results: We describe a case of
mixed Escherichia coli and Peptoniphilus spp. osteomyelitis identified using
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry as
Peptoniphilus harei and present a short literature review.Conclusion: To our
knowledge, only six cases of P. harei osteomyelitis have been reported to date.
