PURPOSE: We offer collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH) injections to all
patients with a Dupuytren contracture and a palpable cord. We assessed whether
more severe contractures respond less well or recur more frequently.
METHODS: From a database of 502 CCH injections, 386 (77%) had a complete dataset 
with minimum 1-year face-to-face follow-up. Contracture severity was assessed
using the Tubiana system: grade 1 (27%), grade 2 (49%), grade 3 (19%), and grade 
4 (5%). Patients received a single intralesional injection of 0.58 mg CCH
followed by manipulation. Finger position was measured at 6 to 12 weeks, 6
months, and 1 year. Failure to break the cord, skin tears, and any adverse events
were noted. Recurrence was defined as a failure to maintain any prior correction 
to within 20°.
RESULTS: There were 17 failures (4%) and 6 allergic reactions (1%). We found 31% 
corrected completely, with approximately half remaining corrected at 1 year. We
achieved 43° (95% confidence interval, 40°-46°) correction of combined deformity,
with 11° (95% confidence interval, 9°-13°) correction attrition over 1 year.
Sixteen percent of treated digits experienced a recurrence with no difference
between Tubiana grades, and one-third chose further treatment. Following
treatment, Tubiana grade 1 contractures improved by 78% in comparison with higher
grade contractures (55%-67% relative correction). By 1 year, all grades had a
similar mean 46% relative correction. A complete correction was seen in 61% of
grade 1 contractures, with more severe contractures less likely to correct
completely (9%-24%). A 31% skin tear rate had no impact on outcome, recurrence,
or long-term morbidity.
CONCLUSIONS: CCH may treat any Dupuytren cord regardless of severity. Although
contracture may recur, few patients pursue further treatment within 1 year.
TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.
