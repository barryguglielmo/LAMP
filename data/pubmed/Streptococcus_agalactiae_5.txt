Streptococccus agalactiae (S. agalactiae) is an important neonatal pathogen that 
is associated with mortality and morbidity. Therefore, we developed a rapid,
accurate, and sensitive method based on multiple cross displacement amplification
(MCDA) for the detection of the target pathogen. Four sets of MCDA primers were
designed for targeting the S. agalactiae-specific groEL gene, and one set of MCDA
primers with the optimum amplification efficiency was screened for establishing
the S. agalactiae-MCDA assay. As a result, the newly-developed assay could be
conducted at a fixed temperature (61°C) for only 30 min, eliminating the use of
complex instruments. A portable and user-friendly nanoparticle-based lateral flow
biosensor (LFB) assay was employed for reporting MCDA results within 2 min. Our
results suggested that the detection limit of the S. agalactiae-MCDA-LFB assay is
300 fg per reaction, and no cross-reaction occurred with non-S. agalactiae
strains. For 260 vaginal and rectal swabs, the detection rate of the MCDA-LFB
assay was 7.7%, which was in accordance with the reference method of
enrichment/qPCR, and higher by 4.6% than the CHROMagar culture. Moreover, the
total procedure time of the MCDA-LFB assay was around 50 min, including sample
collection, template preparation, MCDA reaction, and result reporting. Therefore,
the MCDA-LFB assay is superior to enrichment/qPCR and CHROMagar culture and has
great promise for point-of-care testing of S. agalactiae from vaginal and rectal 
swabs of pregnant women in resource-limited settings.
