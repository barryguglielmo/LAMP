Rhotomentodiones C-E, three new polymethylated phloroglucinol meroterpenoids with
diverse configurations, were isolated from the twigs and leaves of Rhodomyrtus
tomentosa. Their structures and absolute configurations were established mainly
by means of comprehensive spectroscopic data and electron circular dichroism
(ECD) calculation. Among them, Rhotomentodione D (2) exhibited both antibacterial
activity with an MIC value of 12.5 μg/mL against Propionibacterium acnes and AChE
inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 22.9 μm.
