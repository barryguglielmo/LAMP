BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus buchneri is a lactic acid bacterium frequently
associated with food bioprocessing and fermentation and has been found to be
either beneficial or detrimental to industrial food processes depending on the
application. The ability to metabolize lactic acid into acetic acid and
1,2-propandiol makes L. buchneri invaluable to the ensiling process, however,
this metabolic activity leads to spoilage in other applications, and is
especially damaging to the cucumber fermentation industry. This study aims to
augment our genomic understanding of L. buchneri in order to make better use of
the species in a wide range of applicable industrial settings.
RESULTS: Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on seven phenotypically
diverse strains isolated from spoiled, fermented cucumber and the ATCC type
strain for L. buchneri, ATCC 4005. Here, we present our findings from the
comparison of eight newly-sequenced and assembled genomes against two publicly
available closed reference genomes, L. buchneri CD034 and NRRL B-30929. Overall, 
we see ~â€‰50% of all coding sequences are conserved across these ten strains. When
these coding sequences are clustered by functional description, the strains
appear to be enriched in mobile genetic elements, namely transposons. All
isolates harbor at least one CRISPR-Cas system, and many contain putative
prophage regions, some of which are targeted by the host's own DNA-encoded spacer
sequences.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide new insights into the genomics of L. buchneri
through whole genome sequencing and subsequent characterization of genomic
features, building a platform for future studies and identifying elements for
potential strain manipulation or engineering.
