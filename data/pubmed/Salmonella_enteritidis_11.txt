Salmonella is one of the most common agents of foodborne disease worldwide. As
natural alternatives to traditional antimicrobial agents, bacteriophages (phages)
are emerging as highly effective biocontrol agents against Salmonella and other
foodborne bacteria. Due to the high diversity within the Salmonella genus and
emergence of drug resistant strains, improved efforts are necessary to find broad
range and strictly lytic Salmonella phages for use in food biocontrol. Here, we
describe the isolation and characterization of two Salmonella phages: ST-W77
isolated on S. Typhimurium and SE-W109 isolated on S. Enteritidis with
extraordinary Salmonella specificity. Whole genome sequencing identified ST-W77
as a Myovirus within the Viunalikevirus genus and SE-W109 as a Siphovirus within 
the Jerseylikevirus genus. Infectivity studies using a panel of S. Typhimurium
cell wall mutants revealed both phages require the lipopolysaccharide O-antigen, 
with SE-W109 also recognizing the flagella, during infection of Salmonella. A
combination of both phages was capable of prolonged (one-week) antibacterial
activity when added to milk or chicken meat contaminated with Salmonella. Due to 
their broad host ranges, strictly lytic lifestyles and lack of lysogeny-related
genes or virulence genes in their genomes, ST-W77 and SE-W109 are ideal phages
for further development as Salmonella biocontrol agents for food production.
