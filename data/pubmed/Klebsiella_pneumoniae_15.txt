OBJECTIVE: Glycerol-based biosynthesis of 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) in
Klebsiella pneumoniae involves two reactions: glycerol conversion to
3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA) by glycerol dehydratase, and 3-HPA conversion to
3-HP by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). The ALDH catalysis consumes a lot of
cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), which constrains 3-HP
production.
RESULTS: Here we report that intensifying niacin-based biosynthesis of NAD+ can
substantially enhance 3-HP production. We constructed tac promoter-driven NAD+
synthesis pathway in K. pneumoniae. The strain only overexpressing nicotinate
phosphoribosyltransferase (PncB) showed 14.24% increase in the production of NAD+
relative to the stain harboring an empty vector. When PncB was coexpressed with
PuuC (one of native ALDHs), the recombinant strain exhibited increased ALDH
activity but slightly reduced 3-HP production due to plasmid burden. When 30 mg
niacin l-1 (a substrate for biosynthesis of NAD+) was added into shake flask, the
strain produced 0.55 g 3-HP l-1, which was 2.75 times that of the control. In a
5-L bioreactor, replenishment of niacin led to 36.43% increase of 3-HP
production.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that intensifying niacin-based biosynthesis 
of NAD+ boosts 3-HP production.
