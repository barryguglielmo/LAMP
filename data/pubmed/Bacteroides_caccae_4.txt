Risk of celiac disease (CD) is increased in relatives of CD patients due to
genetic and possible environmental factors. We recently reported increased
seropositivity to anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ASCA), Pseudomonas
fluorescens-associated sequence (anti-I2) and Bacteroides caccae TonB-linked
outer membrane protein (anti-OmpW) antibodies in CD. We hypothesized these
markers also to be overrepresented in relatives. Seropositivity and levels of
ASCA, anti-I2 and anti-OmpW were compared between 463 first-degree relatives, 58 
untreated and 55 treated CD patients, and 80 controls. CD-associated human
leukocyte antigen (HLA)-haplotypes and transglutaminase (tTGab) and endomysium
(EmA) antibodies were determined. One or more of the microbial antibodies was
present in 75% of relatives, 97% of untreated and 87% of treated CD patients and 
44% of the controls. The relatives had higher median ASCA IgA (9.13 vs. 4.50
U/mL, p < 0.001), ASCA IgG (8.91 vs. 5.75 U/mL, p < 0.001) and anti-I2
(absorbance 0.74 vs. 0.32, p < 0.001) levels than controls. There was a weak,
positive correlation between tTGab and ASCA (r = 0.31, p < 0.001). Seropositivity
was not significantly associated with HLA. To conclude, seropositivity to
microbial markers was more common and ASCA and anti-I2 levels higher in relatives
of CD patients than controls. These findings were not associated with HLA,
suggesting the role of other genetic and environmental factors.
