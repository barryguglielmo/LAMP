A clone encoding carboxymethyl cellulase activity was isolated during functional 
screening of a human gut metagenomic library using Lactococcus lactis MG1363 as
heterologous host. The insert carried a glycoside hydrolase family 9 (GH9)
catalytic domain with sequence similarity to a gene from Coprococcus eutactus
ART55/1. Genome surveys indicated a limited distribution of GH9 domains among
dominant human colonic anaerobes. Genomes of C. eutactus-related strains
harboured two GH9-encoding and four GH5-encoding genes, but the strains did not
appear to degrade cellulose. Instead, they grew well on β-glucans and one of the 
strains also grew on galactomannan, galactan, glucomannan and starch. Coprococcus
comes and Coprococcus catus strains did not harbour GH9 genes and were not able
to grow on β-glucans. Gene expression and proteomic analysis of C. eutactus
ART55/1 grown on cellobiose, β-glucan and lichenan revealed similar changes in
expression in comparison to glucose. On β-glucan and lichenan only, one of the
four GH5 genes was strongly upregulated. Growth on glucomannan led to a
transcriptional response of many genes, in particular a strong upregulation of
glycoside hydrolases involved in mannan degradation. Thus, β-glucans are a major 
growth substrate for species related to C. eutactus, with glucomannan and
galactans alternative substrates for some strains.
