The phospholipase pl-S.t gene of Sphingobacterium thalpophilum 2015 was cloned
and the gene sequence was submitted to NCBI with Accession Number KX674735.1. The
phylogenetic analysis showed that this PL-S.t was clustered to phospholipase D
(PLD). As far as we know, the PL-S.t with a molecular mass of 22.5 kDa is the
lowest of the currently purified bacterial PLDs, which belongs to a non-HKD PLD
enzyme. This PL-S.t was resistant to a wide range of alkali pHs (7.5-9.0) after 1
h incubation, retaining more than 90% of its maximum activity. The PL-S.t
activity can be enhanced by Ni2+, Co2+ and Mn2+. This PL-S.t has only one
cysteine residue and fewer negatively-charged amino acids (AAs). The hydrogen
bonds network was found around the cystein108, which may be beneficial to the
stability and activity of PL-S.t in Ni2+ solution. This study has laid the
foundation for further research on the molecular mechanism of the catalytic
characteristics of low molecular weight alkalic PLD from S. thalpophilum 2015.
