Purpose: Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacter cloacae complex has been reported
worldwide and becomes a new challenge for clinical management. The present study 
was to characterize the IncX3 plasmid encoding bla NDM-1 and bla SHV-12 gene in
E. hormaechei sequence.
Materials and Methods: EcHK001 was recovered from the sputum sample of a patient.
Species identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed
using the VITEK 2 system, while further classification was carried out by hsp60
typing. The presence of NDM-1 was detected by PCR and sequencing. Conjugation
experiments and southern blotting were carried out to determine the
transferability of the NDM-1-carrying plasmid. Whole-genome sequencing and
analysis were conducted to better understand the molecular characteristics of the
multi-drug resistant isolate.
Results: Strain EcHK001 was classified as E. hormaechei of new sequence type
1000. Multiple drug-resistant genes were detected. The bla NDM-1 and bla SHV-12
genes were located on a self-transferable IncX3 plasmid. Synonymous mutations
were identified in the genes encoding TEM-1 and ACT-17. Phylogenetic analysis
indicated that EcHK001 clustered into a different clade from domestic strains.
Conclusion: The rapid spread of the recurrent IncX3 plasmid highlights the need
for continuous surveillance of the NDM-1 dissemination. The presence of mutations
in existing carbapenem-resistant genes may generate potential new variants and
raise serious challenges for clinical treatment.
