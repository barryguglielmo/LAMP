Actinomyces europeaeus and Actinotignum schaalii are two facultative anaerobes
that are common contaminants of human flora; namely the urinary tract, the female
genital tract and the gastrointestinal tract. A. europeaeus has been linked with 
abscesses, decubitus ulcers and purulent urethritis, while A. schaalii has been
associated with urinary tract infections, bacteremia and Fournier's gangrene.
Here we present a case report of an 84-year-old female patient found to have a
necrotizing soft tissue infection caused by A. europeaeus and A. schaalii. To our
knowledge, this is the first case report that documents A. europeaeus as a causal
agent of a necrotizing infection.
