Production of Taste Enhancers from Protein Hydrolysates of Porcine Hemoglobin and
Meat Using Bacillus amyloliquefaciens γ-glutamyltranspeptidase.

To improve the flavor of hydrolysates from porcine hemoglobin and meat,
γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens was added to
catalyze the formation of kokumi γ-glutamyl peptides via γ-glutamyl transfer
reaction. Quantitation of free amino acids and γ-glutamyl dipeptides was carried 
out in combination with sensory analysis. Sensory perception especially thick,
complex, continuous and overall kokumi sensation of both hemoglobin and meat
hydrolysates was greatly enhanced by γ-glutamylation. Due to the higher amount of
glutamine present in meat hydrolysates, γ-glutamylated hydrolysates from meat
contained higher concentrations of γ-glutamyl dipeptides and showed stronger
kokumi sensation than the hemoglobin counterpart when without adding glutamine.
For hydrolysates from both raw materials, extra addition of glutamine (10 mM and 
20 mM) was beneficial for obtaining higher concentrations of γ-glutamyl
dipeptides, but contributed little to kokumi sensation. This study revealed that 
kokumi sensation of protein hydrolysates could be intensified by γ-glutamyl
transfer reaction, and the enhanced kokumi sensation could be related to the
generation of γ-glutamyl peptides.
