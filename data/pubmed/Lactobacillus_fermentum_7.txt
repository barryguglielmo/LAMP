The potential Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) binding Lactobacillus fermentum (LC5/a) was
used for in vivo AFB1 binding and detoxification in presence of chlorophyll (CL) 
in male Swiss albino mice. Mice were randomly divided into seven groups. The
control groups (CL, AFB1 and LC5/a) received chlorophyll (250 μg/kg b.w), AFB1
(100 μg/kg b.w) and LC5/a (1 × 108 CFU) for 21 days. The treatment group
(AFB1+LC5/a) received 100 μl of lyophilized bacterial suspension (1 × 108 CFU)
2 h before the AFB1 dosage (100μg/kg b.w). The chlorophyll mice group (CL + AFB1)
was given single oral dose of CL (250 μg/kg b.w) before AFB1 dosage and last mice
group received the combination of CL + LC5/a before the AFB1 dosage over a period
of 21 days. Ballooning of cytoplasm and necrosis in liver was evident in
histopathological examination of AFB1 mice group, while, marked improvement and
nearly normal histology were seen in LC5/a and CL treated mice group. The levels 
of AST, ALT, GST, and SOD were increased in AFB1 mice group compared to LC5/a and
CL treated mice group. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α,
IL-12, IL-6 (324, 506, 117.25 pg/ml) were observed in AFB1 treated mice serum
compared to LC5/a and CL treated mice (249.54, 322.01 and 82.35 pg/ml). Thus,
Lactobacillus fermentum LC5/a has certainly sequestered AFB1 from
gastrointestinal tract besides regulating the production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines.
