S. schleiferi is one of the main species isolated from canine otitis externa,
pyoderma and from apparently healthy dogs. The species is divided into two
subspecies, S. schleiferi schleiferi and S. schleiferi coagulans. MALDI-TOF MS
does not distinguish correctly these two subspecies. This study aimed to identify
biomarkers that could possibly discriminate Staphylococcus schleiferi subspecies 
by MALDI-TOF MS. Twelve strains (eight S. schleiferi schleiferi and four S.
schleiferi coagulans) were firstly identified. Each isolate was submitted to a
protein extraction protocol and subjected to spectrometry on Bruker Microflex LT 
mass spectrometer. Spectra were analyzed with the BioNumerics software v7.6. Our 
results showed that spectra clustered according to subspecies, and a set of five 
MALDI-TOF MS biomarkers were selected to enable the discrimination of S.
schleiferi subspecies. In addition, these biomarkers were predicted to represent 
highly conserved proteins, which could contribute to the identification of
subspecies-specific proteins that could be used for improved subspecies
identification in clinical samples.
