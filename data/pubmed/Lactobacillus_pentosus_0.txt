OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to determine the effects of probiotic
supplementation on cholesterol-triglyceride ratio, an indirect marker of insulin 
resistance, protein-bound uremic toxins, biomarkers of inflammation, and
microbial translocation in end-stage renal disease patients on hemodialysis.
METHODS: Fifty-six patients aged 39-75 years were assigned into two groups to
receive either probiotic sachets (n = 28) or a placebo (n = 28) in a randomized
double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial. The patients in the probiotic
group received twice daily sachets that contained a mixture of three viable and
freeze-dried strains: Lactococcus lactis subsp. Lactis LL358, Lactobaccillus
salivarius LS159, and Lactobaccillus pentosus LPE588 at high dose (100 billion;
1 × 1011 cfu/day) for 6 months.
RESULTS: A total of 50 patients were available for final analysis. Probiotic
supplementation did not have a significant influence on cholesterol-triglyceride 
ratio. Probiotic supplementation for 6 months caused a significant decrease in
serum levels of indoxyl sulfate. Compared with the placebo, probiotic
supplementation did not result in significant changes in hemoglobin levels, blood
urea nitrogen, blood glucose, serum p-cresyl sulfate, inflammatory, and microbial
translocation markers. No clinically significant changes in body composition were
observed between the two groups during the study period. The probiotic
supplementation was well tolerated by all subjects with minimal adverse effects
during the 6-month-long study.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that high-dose multistrain lactobaccillus
probiotic supplementation over 6 months as a monotherapy did not significantly
decrease markers of insulin resistance, cholesterol-triglyceride ratio, and most 
of the studied markers, with the exception of levels of indoxyl sulfate in
patients on HD.
