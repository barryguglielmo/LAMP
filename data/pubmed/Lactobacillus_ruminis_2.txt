Lactobacillus ruminis is a commensal motile lactic acid bacterium living in the
intestinal tract of humans and animals. Although a few genomes of L. ruminis were
published, most of them were animal derived. To explore the genetic diversity and
potential niche-specific adaptation changes of L. ruminis, in the current work,
draft genomes of 81 L. ruminis strains isolated from human, bovine, piglet, and
other animals were sequenced, and comparative genomic analysis was performed. The
genome size and GC content of L. ruminis on average were 2.16 Mb and 43.65%,
respectively. Both the origin and the sampling distance of these strains had a
great influence on the phylogenetic relationship. For carbohydrate utilization,
the human-derived L. ruminis strains had a higher consistency in the utilization 
of carbon source compared to the animal-derived strains. L. ruminis mainly
increased the competitiveness of niches by producing class II bacteriocins. The
type of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
/CRISPR-associated (CRISPR/Cas) system presented in L. ruminis was mainly subtype
IIA. The diversity of CRISPR/Cas locus depended on the high denaturation of
spacer number and sequence, although cas1 protein was relatively conservative.
The genetic differences in those newly sequenced L. ruminis strains highlighted
the gene gains and losses attributed to niche adaptations.
