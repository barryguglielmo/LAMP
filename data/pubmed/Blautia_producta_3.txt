Immuno-modulatory effects of infant gut bacteria were tested on poly(I:C)
stimulated HT-29 intestinal epithelial cells. Blautia producta, Bacteroides
vulgatus, Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron decreased
transcription of poly(I:C)-induced inflammatory genes. Modulation of basal level 
and poly(I:C)-induced IL-8 secretion varied between bacterial species, and
between heat treated and non-heat treated bacterial cells.
