In this epidemiologic study, 16â€‰S rRNA sequencing was used to investigate the
changes of diversity and composition profile of gut microbiota resulting from
long-term exposure to multiple metals, including arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd),
cuprum (Cu), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn). Due to long-term exposure to various
metals, the relative abundances of Lachnospiraceae, Eubacterium eligens,
Ruminococcaceae UGG-014, Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003, Tyzzerella 3, Bacteroides, 
Slackia, italics, and Roseburia were found to become much higher, whereas the
abundance of Prevotella 9 presented an opposite trend. Additionally, differences 
between males and female groups were found, such as the greater richness and
evenness of bacteria for men subjected to long-term metal exposure in polluted
areas. The changes of men's microbiomes were more significant as a result of
higher daily intake, mining and smelting activity, and living habits. This
research presents a new theoretical basis for the correlation between long-term
metal exposure and gut health for people living in contaminated areas.
