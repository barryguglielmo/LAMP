BACKGROUND: Dysbiosis and colonization with Staphylococcus aureus is considered
to play an important role in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD).
Recovering this dysbiosis may improve AD symptoms. Omiganan is a synthetic
indolicidin analogue antimicrobial peptide with activity against S. aureus and
could be a viable new treatment option for AD.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the tolerability, clinical efficacy and pharmacodynamics of
omiganan in mild-to-moderate AD.
METHODS: Eighty patients were randomized to omiganan 1%, 1.75%, 2.5% or vehicle
twice daily for 28 days on all lesions. Weekly visits included clinical scores,
and microbiological and pharmacodynamic assessments of one 'target lesion'.
RESULTS: In all omiganan treatment groups dysbiosis was recovered by reducing
Staphylococcus abundance and increasing diversity. A reduction of cultured S.
aureus was observed in all omiganan treatment groups, with a significant
reduction for omiganan 2.5% compared to vehicle (-93.5%, 95%CI=-99.2%/-28.5%
p=0.02). No significant clinical improvement was observed.
CONCLUSION: Topical administration of omiganan twice daily for up to 28 days in
patients with mild-to-moderate AD led to a recovery of dysbiosis, but without
clinical improvement. Therefore, a mono-treatment that selectively targets the
microbiome does not appear to be a successful treatment strategy in
mild-to-moderate AD.
