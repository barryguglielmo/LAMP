Undernutrition remains a public health problem in the developing world with an
attributable under-five death proportion of 45%. Lower gut microbiota diversity
and poor metabolic output are associated with undernutrition and new therapeutic 
paths may come from steering gut microbiota composition and functionality. Using 
a dynamic gut model, the Simulator of Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem
(SHIME®), we investigated the effect of a lipid-based nutrient supplement
enriched with prebiotics (LNSp), compared to LNS alone and control treatment, on 
the composition and metabolic functionality of fecal microbiota from three
infants suffering from undernutrition. LNS elicited a significant increase in
acetate and branched-chain fatty acid production, and a higher relative abundance
of the genera Prevotella, Megasphaera, Acinetobacter, Acidaminococcus and
Pseudomonas. In contrast, LNSp treatment resulted in a significant 9-fold
increase in Bifidobacterium relative abundance and a decrease in that of
potential pathogens and detrimental bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae spp. and 
Bilophila sp. Moreover, the LNSp treatment resulted in a significantly higher
production of acetate, butyrate and propionate, as compared to control and LNS.
Our results suggest that provision of prebiotic-enhanced LNS to undernourished
children could be a possible strategy to steer the microbiota toward a more
beneficial composition and metabolic activity. Further in vivo investigations are
needed to assess these effects and their repercussion on nutritional status.
