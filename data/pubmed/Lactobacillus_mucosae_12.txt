The potential probiotic benefits of Lactobacillus mucosae have received
increasing attention. To investigate the genetic diversity of L. mucosae,
comparative genomic analyses of 93 strains isolated from different niches (human 
and animal gut, human vagina, etc.) and eight strains of published genomes were
conducted. The results showed that the core genome of L. mucosae mainly encoded
translation and transcription, amino acid biosynthesis, sugar metabolism, and
defense function while the pan-genomic curve tended to be close. The genetic
diversity of L. mucosae mainly reflected in carbohydrate metabolism and
immune/competitive-related factors, such as exopolysaccharide (EPS), enterolysin 
A, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas. It
was worth noting that this research firstly predicted the complete EPS operon
shared among L. mucosae. Additionally, the type IIIA CRISPR-Cas system was
discovered in L. mucosae for the first time. This work provided new ideas for the
study of this species.
