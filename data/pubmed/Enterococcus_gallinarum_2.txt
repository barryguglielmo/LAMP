Enterococcus gallinarum and casseliflavus have inherent vancomycin resistance
and, though known as pathogens, have not been well characterized in pediatric
patients. We identified a significant prevalence of these enterococcal species
among immunocompromised patients at a large pediatric institution and describe
the impact on patient care, antibiotic stewardship, and infection control.
