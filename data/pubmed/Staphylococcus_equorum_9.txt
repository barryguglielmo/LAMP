To shed light on the genetic differences among food-originated coagulase-negative
Staphylococcus (CNS), we performed pan-genome analysis of five species:
Staphylococcus carnosus (two strains), Staphylococcus equorum (two strains),
Staphylococcus succinus (three strains), Staphylococcus xylosus (two strains),
and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (one strain). The pan-genome size increases with
each new strain and currently holds about 4,500 genes from 10 genomes. Specific
genes were shown to be strain dependent but not species dependent. Most specific 
genes were of unknown function or encoded restriction-modification enzymes,
transposases, or prophages. Our results indicate that unique genes have been
acquired or lost by convergent evolution within individual strains.
