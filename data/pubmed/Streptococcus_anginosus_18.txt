Background: Microorganisms in the mouth are protected from negative environmental
conditions by forming biofilms; however, the use of anti-plaque agents in
children is not preferred due to toxic side effects. Green tea has been reported 
to have anti-microbial and anti-dental caries properties.
Aims: The aim of this study was to assess the ability of green tea extract to
prevent the formation of biofilm on the teeth of children using space
maintainers.
Methods: Bacteria were isolated from samples obtained from children aged between 
8 and 10 years. The micro-titer plate method and Congo red agar were used to
assay biofilm formation. Green tea leaves were obtained from Rize, Turkey.
Methanol, hexane and distilled water were used for preparing the extracts. The
effects of green tea extract and chlorhexidine on biofilm formation were examined
using scanning electron microscopy.
Results: Presence of S. mutans 3,3, S. anginosus 2.1.b, S. dysgalactie 6.1.4.1,
and E. faecium 10.2. was measured in the biofilm samples. The extracts showed a
bacteriostatic effect on the test bacteria, and among the green tea extracts, the
methanol extract was found to exhibit the highest efficacy against biofilm
formation by S. mutans 3.3.
Conclusion: Green tea extract showed good efficacy in controlling bacterial
growth, and is recommended as a better-tasting alternative for daily oral hygiene
due to a lack of known side effects.
