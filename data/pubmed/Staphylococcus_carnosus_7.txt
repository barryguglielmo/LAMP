The NreB-NreC two-component system of Staphylococcus carnosus for O2 sensing
cooperates with the accessory nitrate sensor NreA in the NreA-NreB-NreC system
for coordinated sensing and regulation of nitrate respiration by O2 and nitrate. 
ApoNreA (NreA in the absence of nitrate) interacts with NreB and inhibits NreB
autophosphorylation (and activation). NreB contains the phosphatase motif DxxxQ. 
The present study shows that NreB on its own was inactive for the
dephosphorylation of the phosphorylated response regulator NreC (NreC-P), but
co-incubation with NreB and NreA stimulated NreC-P dephosphorylation. Either the 
presence of NreA · NO 3 - instead of apoNreA or mutation of the phosphatase motif
(D160 or Q164) of NreB abrogated phosphatase activity of NreB. Phosphatase
activity was observed for anoxic (active) NreB as well as oxic NreB, therefore
the functional state of NreB is not relevant for phosphatase activity. Thus, NreB
is a bifunctional sensor kinase with an integral cryptic phosphatase activity.
Activation of phosphatase activity and dephosphorylation of NreC-P requires NreA 
as a cofactor. Accordingly, NreA and nitrate have major and dual roles in
NreA-NreB-NreC regulation by (i) inhibiting NreB phosphorylation and (ii)
triggering a kinase/phosphatase switch of NreB when present as apoNreA.
