A mysterious feature of Crohn's disease (CD) is the extra-intestinal
manifestation of "creeping fat" (CrF), defined as expansion of mesenteric adipose
tissue around the inflamed and fibrotic intestine. In the current study, we
explore whether microbial translocation in CD serves as a central cue for CrF
development. We discovered a subset of mucosal-associated gut bacteria that
consistently translocated and remained viable in CrF in CD ileal surgical
resections, and identified Clostridium innocuum as a signature of this consortium
with strain variation between mucosal and adipose isolates, suggesting preference
for lipid-rich environments. Single-cell RNA sequencing characterized CrF as both
pro-fibrotic and pro-adipogenic with a rich milieu of activated immune cells
responding to microbial stimuli, which we confirm in gnotobiotic mice colonized
with C. innocuum. Ex vivo validation of expression patterns suggests C. innocuum 
stimulates tissue remodeling via M2 macrophages, leading to an adipose tissue
barrier that serves to prevent systemic dissemination of bacteria.
