The endemic spread of plastic in the environment requires urgent need of a
sustainable approach. Marine microbes found to have vast bioactivity and play a
central role in biogeochemical cycling in the ocean; however, very few of them
had been explored for biochemical cycling or plastic degradation. In the present 
study, we report the draft genome sequence of marine Bacillus sp. AIIW2 which was
found to utilize plastic as a carbon source. The Bacillus sonorensis SRCM101395
was used as a reference genome for mapping the reads. The genome size of strain
AIIW2 was approximately 4.4 Mb and composed of 4737 coding sequences with 45.7%
G + C contents. The whole genome comparison of strain AIIW2 with three closest
Bacillus strains showed strain specificity, the 16S ribosomal RNA sequence shows 
99.93% similarity with Bacillus paralicheniformis KJ-16T (KY694465). This genome 
data would provide the genetic basis in developing plastic bioremediation
approaches and discover the enzymes pertinent in the biodegradation processes.
