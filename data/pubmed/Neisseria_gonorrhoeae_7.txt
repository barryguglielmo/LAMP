BACKGROUND: Sexually Transmitted Infections remain a major public health concern 
worldwide. Although traditionally considered treatable, the emergence of
Neisseria gonorrhoeae resistance to antimicrobials is currently a serious
problem. The goal of this study was to evaluate the incidence and trends of
antimicrobial resistance over the last 10 years in N. gonorrhoeae isolates from a
Portuguese Centre.
METHODS: Laboratorial confirmed N. gonorrhoeae infections diagnosed between 2009 
and 2018 were evaluated. Susceptibilities to penicillin, tetracycline,
ciprofloxacin, azithromycin and cefotaxime were studied, along with demographic
and clinical characteristics.
RESULTS: From 2009 to 2018, 440 cases of N. gonorrhoeae infection were diagnosed 
in our center, with a significant yearly increase (p<0.05). Most cases occurred
in males (97.9%), with a median age of 25 years. In 88.7% of the cases, treatment
with ceftriaxone plus azithromycin was used. Resistances to penicillin,
tetracycline and ciprofloxacin remained high throughout the study period.
CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial resistance of N. gonorrhoeae appeared shortly after
the introduction of antimicrobials. To combat this problem, improved surveillance
and more studies combining susceptibility and epidemiological data are needed. In
our population, N. gonorrhoeae remains highly susceptible to the antibiotics
currently recommended for its treatment, whereas ciprofloxacin, azithromycin (in 
monotherapy) and penicillin should be avoided as empirical treatment.
