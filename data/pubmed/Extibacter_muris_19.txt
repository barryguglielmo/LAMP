High-throughput single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool for studying
gene expression in single cells. Most current scRNA-seq bioinformatics tools
focus on analysing overall expression levels, largely ignoring alternative mRNA
isoform expression. We present a computational pipeline, Sierra, that readily
detects differential transcript usage from data generated by commonly used
polyA-captured scRNA-seq technology. We validate Sierra by comparing cardiac
scRNA-seq cell types to bulk RNA-seq of matched populations, finding significant 
overlap in differential transcripts. Sierra detects differential transcript usage
across human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the Tabula Muris, and 3 'UTR 
shortening in cardiac fibroblasts. Sierra is available at
