Twenty-eight compounds were isolated from endophytic, soil and marine fungi and
their structures were elucidated through spectroscopic methods. The isolated
compounds were tested for their antibacterial and herbicidal activities against
phytopathogenic bacteria and barnyard grass weed for the first time.
Methyleurotinone (14) was the most potent compound against Pectobacterium
carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, Rhizobium
radiobacter and Ralstonia solanacearum with minimum inhibitory concentration
(MIC) values of 31.3, 125, 31.3 and 125 mg/L, respectively. Compounds 13-15 were 
highly effective in reducing the development of potato tuber soft rot disease
caused by P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum. Furthermore, twelve of the tested
compounds induced a significant reduction in seed germination of Echinochloa
crus-galli at 2 mM with compounds 8 and 26 causing complete inhibition of seed
germination. Also, compounds 4, 22, 5, 8, 18 and 25-27 induced remarkable
reduction of root and shoot growth of E. crus-galli at 2 mM.
