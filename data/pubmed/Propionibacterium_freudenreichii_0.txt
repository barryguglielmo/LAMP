This study explores the production of polysaccharides (PS) in the strain Pf2289
of the food species Propionibacterium freudenreichii. Pf2289 presents
characteristics atypical of the species: a molar-shaped morphotype upon plating, 
and cells strongly aggregative in liquid medium. When plating Pf2289, another
morphotype was observed with a 4% frequency of appearance: round-shaped colonies,
typical of the species. A clone was isolated, designated Pf456. No reversibility 
of Pf456 towards the molar-shaped morphotype was observed. Pf2289 was shown to
produce a surface polysaccharide (PS) bound to the cell wall, mainly during the
stationary growth phase. Meanwhile, Pf456 had lost the ability to produce the PS.
AFM images of Pf2289 showed that entangled filaments spread over the whole
surface of the bacteria, whereas Pf456 exhibited a smooth surface. Adhesion force
maps, performed with concanavalin-A grafted probes, revealed twice as much
adhesion of Pf2289 to concanavalin-A compared to Pf456. Furthermore, the length
of PS molecules surrounding Pf2289 measured at least 7 μm, whereas it only
reached 1 μm in Pf456. Finally, the presence of PS had a strong impact on
adhesion properties: Pf2289 did not adhere to hydrophobic surfaces, whereas Pf456
showed strong adhesion.
