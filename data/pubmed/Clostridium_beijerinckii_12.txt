Sago hampas is a starch-based biomass from sago processing industries consisted
of 58% remaining starch. This study has demonstrated the bioconversion of sago
hampas to volatile fatty acids (VFAs) by Clostridium beijerinckii SR1 via
anaerobic digestion. Higher total VFAs were obtained from sago hampas (5.04 g/L
and 0.287 g/g) as compared to commercial starch (5.94 g/L and 0.318 g/g). The
physical factors have been investigated for the enhancement of VFAs production
using one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT). The optimum condition; 3% substrate
concentration, 3 g/L of yeast extract concentration and 2 g/L of ammonium nitrate
enhanced the production of VFAs by 52.6%, resulted the total VFAs produced is
7.69 g/L with the VFAs yield of 0.451 g/g. VFAs hydrolysate produced successfully
generated 273.4 mV of open voltage circuit and 61.5 mW/m2 of power density in
microbial fuel cells. It was suggested that sago hampas provide as an alternative
carbon feedstock for bioelectricity generation.
