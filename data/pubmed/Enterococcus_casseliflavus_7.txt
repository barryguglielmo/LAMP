AIM: It is well-known that enterococci are abundant in the environment; however, 
the role of surface water as a reservoir of antimicrobial-resistant enterococci
remains largely undefined. In this study, surface water samples were collected
over a 2-year period from the Upper Oconee watershed, Athens, GA to examine
enterococci and their antimicrobial resistance.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Approximately 97% (445/458) of the samples were positive for
enterococci and a total of 637 enterococci were isolated. The predominant species
were Enterococcus casseliflavus (33·6%) followed by Enterococcus faecalis (26·5%)
and Enterococcus hirae (13·2%). Regardless of species, the highest levels of
resistance were to lincomycin (88·5%) and tetracycline (13%); isolates also
exhibited resistance to newer antimicrobials, daptomycin (8·9%) and tigecycline
(6·4%). Multidrug resistance (resistance ≥3 antimicrobial classes) was observed
to as many as five classes of antimicrobials. Resistant enterococci appeared to
be randomly dispersed over the seasons rather than clustered by species or
antimicrobial resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that surface waters contain a large
population of diverse species of antimicrobial-resistant enterococci, including
resistance to new antimicrobials.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These results may indicate the potential of
human intestinal illness and/or colonization of the human gut with resistant
enterococci as enterococci correlate with increased disease risk to humans during
recreational exposure to water.
