BACKGROUND: The burden of non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) disease is
increasing worldwide but still its diagnosis is delayed and it is mistaken as
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).The present study was performed to
develop a multiplex PCR assay for detection and identification of clinically most
common NTM to the species level from pulmonary samples.
RESULTS: Out of 50 isolates, 26 were identified as Mycobacterium kansasii (MK),
20 were identified as Mycobacterium abscessus (MA) and 4 were identified as
Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) through multiplex PCR and further confirmed by 
sequencing.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed that multiplex PCR assay is a simple, convenient,
and reliable technique for detection and differential identification of major NTM
species.
