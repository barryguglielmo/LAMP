Lactobacillus species play an important role in the host and although they are
non-pathogenic, they could act as reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes,
with the potential risk of transfer to other bacteria inhabiting the
gastrointestinal tract. The aim of this study was to identify Lactobacillus
species derived from feces of domesticated pigeons and to characterize their
phenotypic and genotypic antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles. A total of 57
Lactobacillus isolates were classified into six species using the MALDI-TOF
technique and 16S rDNA restriction analysis. Strains of L. ingluviei (31%),
L. salivarius (28%) and L. agilis (23%) were the dominant species isolated.
Determination of antimicrobial susceptibility by the microdilution broth method
showed widespread resistance to kanamycin (89%), tetracycline (84%), streptomycin
(63%), and enrofloxacin (37%). Less than 30% of the isolates were resistant to
erythromycin, lincosamides, gentamycin, chloramphenicol and vancomycin. Over half
(51%) of the lactobacilli were classified as multidrug resistant. Tet genes were 
detected in 79% of isolates; the lnuA, cat, ermB, ermC, ant(6)-Ia, ant(4')-Ia,
and int-Tn genes were found at a lower frequency. Sequence analysis of the
quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR)of the gyrA gene showed that
fluoroquinolone resistance in lactobacilli was the result of a mutation that lead
to a change in the amino acid sequence (Ser83→Tyr/Leu/Phe). Domesticated pigeons 
could be a reservoir for AMR Lactobacillus strains and AMR genes.
