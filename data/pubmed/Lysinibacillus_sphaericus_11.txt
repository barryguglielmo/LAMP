We observed instances of cannibalism (intraspecific predation) among intra-instar
larvae of Culex pipiens Linnaeus, 1758 while performing a bioassay of
Lysinibacillus sphaericus (formerly named Bacillus sphaericus) larvicide, when
the larvae were exposed to the larvicide for 48 h in the absence of food. Larvae 
without symptoms of poisoning attacked and devoured those visibly affected.
Cannibalism was more prevalent in 1st-2nd instar larvae than in 3rd-4th instar.
This phenomenon should be taken into account when interpreting the results of
larvicide bioassays, especially when the exposure lasts over 24 h. The necessity 
of creating optimal conditions for organisms tested is emphasised.
