Excessive fecal bile acid (BA) loss causes symptoms in a large proportion of
people diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea, a common functional
bowel disorder. This BA diarrhea (BAD) results from increased hepatic synthesis
of BAs, with impaired negative feedback regulation by the ileal hormone
fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19). In this issue of the JCI, Zhao et al.
investigated BA metabolism, including fecal BAs, serum BAs, and FGF19, in
patients and controls. They identified associations between fecal bacterial BA
metabolism and specific microbiota, especially Clostridium scindens. These
findings have been tested in a mouse model using microbiota transplants and
antibiotic treatment. This group of organisms has potential as a biomarker for
BAD and to be a target for therapy.
