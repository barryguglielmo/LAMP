Comamonas kerstersii is a non-fermenting Gram-negative bacillus. It has been
associated with intra-abdominal infections. We describe a clinical case of
bacteremia caused by C. kerstersii in a young man with acute appendicitis. The
first identification, using the Vitek2 compact system (BioMerieux) from blood
cultures, was Comamonas testosteroni. However, using MALDI-TOF was identified as 
C. kerstersii. The patient was treated first with ampicillin sulbactam and then
piperacillin tazobactam with favorable evolution. Within the genus Comamonas, C. 
testosteroni has been the most frequently reported species as a cause of
infections in humans, only 23 cases of C. kerstersii being described. Given the
problems of phenotypic identification of these microorganisms, it is possible
that some C. testosteroni reports could have corresponded to C. kerstersii. This 
case highlights the pathogenic role of C. kerstersii and the importance of using 
MALDI-TOF as a diagnostic tool for non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli
identification.
