Purpose: The incidence of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) has been
reported as 10-fold higher among the elderly population than in young adults. The
aim of this study was to compare the targeted bacteria population in the fecal
microbiota in two groups of hospitalized elderly, categorized according to CDI
and non-CDI.
Patient and Methods: In this case-control study, 84 fecal samples of the 28
patients with CDI and 56 non-CDI patients (>65 years) were studied. C. difficile 
isolates were characterized by anaerobic culture and multiplex PCR. Quantitative 
PCR was used to analyze the bacterial elements.
Results: CDI group differed significantly for a prolonged hospital stay, previous
surgery, residence in nursing home and exposure to a range of antibiotics
including quinolone, clindamycin and cephalosporin. CDI group had significantly
fewer members of Bacteroides spp., Clostridium cluster IV, Bifidobacterium spp., 
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Prevotella spp. in their fecal microbiota than 
the control group (P < 0.05). The abundances of Akkermansia muciniphila,
Lactobacillus spp., Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. were higher in group CDI
compared with the control group (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: CDI status is associated with the abundance of some bacterial
populations. In this study, an increase in Akkermansia muciniphila, Lactobacillus
spp., and Enterobacteriaceae genus was highlighted in CDI patients. A reduction
in butyrate-producing bacteria was found in CDI patients. The differences in the 
composition of fecal microbiota can help to understand how antimicrobial agents
impact on gut homeostasis and lead to loss of colonization resistance to C.
difficile.
