Over 1,000 clinical studies with probiotics, registered at ClinicalTrials.gov
and/or the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) of the World
Health Organization, have addressed over 700 different diseases and conditions.
The average size of a clinical trial with probiotics (74 participants) is
comparable to the overall average of all studies in ClincialTrials.gov.
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis BB12
are the probiotic strains studied most. The exact composition of the product
which is used, including the dosage, is not always indicated in the registry. The
majority of probiotics studies at ClinicalTrials.gov is registered in the USA or 
Europe (56%). The data from ICTRP show the rapid expansion of clinical studies
with probiotics in Asia, notably Iran and China.
