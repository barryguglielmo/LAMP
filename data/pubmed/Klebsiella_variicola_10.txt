Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB)
could interact synergistically because PSB solubilize sparingly available
phosphorous compounds into orthophosphate that AMF can absorb and transport to
the host plant. Little is known about the interactions between these two groups
in terms of promoting Jerusalem artichoke, Helianthus tuberosus L., which is
widely planted by farmers because of its high inulin content. Production depends 
mainly on synthetic fertilizers as source of plant nutrients. This study aimed to
isolate and characterize PSB and investigate the effects of co-inoculation of AMF
and PSB on plant performance and inulin accumulation. Isolate UDJA102x89-9,
identified as Klebsiella variicola (KV), showed phosphate-solubilizing ability
and produced high amounts of several organic acids in vitro and of
indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). The experiment combined KV and two AMF species
(Glomus multisubtensum (GM) and Rhizophagus intraradices (RI)). Co-inoculation of
KV with RI, in combination with rock phosphate, showed the largest increases in
plant growth and tuber inulin content, compared both to an unfertilized and
fertilized control. This result would reveal whether the phosphate solubilization
and IAA property of the PSB in vitro played a significant role in changing plant 
growth and production, and the available P was subsequently taken up and
transported to plant roots by AMF. The high combined effect may have the
potential for use by farmers in the future as a biofertilizer for inulin
production by Helianthus tuberosus L.
