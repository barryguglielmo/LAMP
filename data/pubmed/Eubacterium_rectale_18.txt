BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Gut microbiota alterations in chronic pancreatitis (CP)
are seldomly described systematically. It is unknown whether pancreatic exocrine 
insufficiency (PEI) and different etiologies in patients with CP are associated
with gut microbiota dysbiosis.
METHODS: The fecal microbiota of 69 healthy controls (HCs) and 71 patients with
CP were compared to investigate gut microbiome alterations in CP and the
relationship among gut microbiome dysbiosis, PEI and different etiologies. Fecal 
microbiomes were analyzed through 16S ribosomal RNA gene profiling, based on
next-generation sequencing. Pancreatic exocrine function was evaluated by
determining fecal elastase 1 activity.
RESULTS: Patients with CP showed gut microbiota dysbiosis with decreased
diversity and richness, and taxa-composition changes. On the phylum level, the
gut microbiome of the CP group showed lower Firmicutes and Actinobacteria
abundances than the HC group and higher Proteobacteria abundances. The abundances
of Escherichia-Shigella and other genera were high in gut microbiomes in the CP
group, whereas that of Faecalibacterium was low. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes pathways (lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and bacterial invasion of
epithelial cells) were predicted to be enriched in the CP group. Among the top 5 
phyla and 8 genera (in terms of abundance), only Fusobacteria and Eubacterium
rectale group showed significant differences between CP patients, with or without
PEI. Correlation analysis showed that Bifidobacterium and Lachnoclostridium
correlated positively with fecal elastase 1 (r = 0.2616 and 0.2486, respectively,
P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The current findings indicate that patients with CP have gut
microbiota dysbiosis that is partly affected by pancreatic exocrine function.
