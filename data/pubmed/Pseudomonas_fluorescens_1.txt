Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO) and copper binding protein CopC share a
similar mononuclear copper site. This site is defined by an N-terminal histidine 
and a second internal histidine side chain in a configuration called the
histidine brace. To understand better the determinants of reactivity, the
biochemical and structural properties of a well-described cellulose-specific LPMO
from Thermoascus aurantiacus (TaAA9A) is compared with that of CopC from
Pseudomonas fluorescens (PfCopC) and with the LPMO-like protein Bim1 from
Cryptococcus neoformans. PfCopC is not reduced by ascorbate but is a very strong 
Cu(II) chelator due to residues that interacts with the N-terminus. This first
biochemical characterization of Bim1 shows that it is not redox active, but very 
sensitive to H2O2, which accelerates the release of Cu ions from the protein.
TaAA9A oxidizes ascorbate at a rate similar to free copper but through a
mechanism that produce fewer reactive oxygen species. These three biologically
relevant examples emphasize the diversity in how the proteinaceous environment
control reactivity of Cu with O2.
