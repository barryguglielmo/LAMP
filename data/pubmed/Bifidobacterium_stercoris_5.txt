Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter
playing a key role in anxiety and depression disorders in mammals. Recent studies
revealed that members of the gut microbiota are able to produce GABA modulating
the gut-brain axis response. Among members of the human gut microbiota,
bifidobacteria are well known to establish many metabolic and physiologic
interactions with the host. In this study, we performed genome analyses of more
than 1,000 bifidobacterial strains publicly available revealing that
Bifidobacterium adolescentis taxon might represent a model GABA producer in human
gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, the in silico screening of human/animal
metagenomic datasets showed an intriguing association/correlation between B.
adolescentis load and mental disorders such as depression and anxiety.
Interestingly, in vitro screening of 82 B. adolescentis strains allowed
identifying two high GABA producers, i.e. B. adolescentis PRL2019 and B.
adolescentis HD17T2H, which were employed in an in vivo trial in rats. Feeding
Groningen rats with a supplementation of B. adolescentis strains, confirmed the
ability of these microorganisms to stimulate the in vivo production of GABA
highlighting their potential implication in gut-brain axis interactions.
