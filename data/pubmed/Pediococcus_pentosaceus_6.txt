Lactic acid bacteria of Lactobacillus curvatus LAB26 and Pediococcus pentosaceus 
SWU73571 isolated from traditional sour meat were prepared to a double-starter
culture for sour meat processing. The results showed that the counts of total
bacteria and lactic acid bacteria in inoculating group reached 9.37 ± 0.11 log
cfu/g and 8.73 ± 0.14 log cfu/g on the 30th day, and were higher than those in
natural fermentation (7.02 ± 0.11 log cfu/g and 6.93 ± 0.17 log cfu/g). Compared 
to natural fermentation, the double-starter culture increased the L* and
a*values, amino nitrogen content, free amino acid content of sour meat
significantly, and lowered the b* value, restrained the coliform count, nitrite, 
biogenic amines, total volatile basic nitrogen and malondialdehyde in sour meat. 
Moreover, the pH and water activity were reduced to 3.91 ± 0.01 and
0.831 ± 0.002, respectively. These results proved that the inoculation of
double-starter culture could improve the quality and safety of sour meat. This
double-starter culture has great potential for application to the manufacture of 
fermented meat.
