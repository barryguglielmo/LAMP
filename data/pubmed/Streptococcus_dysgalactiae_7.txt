Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and their associated signaling pathways play pivotal
roles in the immune response to invading pathogens. Here, TLR13, TLR22, tumor
necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), and transforming growth
factor-β-activated kinase1 (TAK1) were characterized in the soiny mullet (Liza
haematocheila), representative mugilid species that is widely cultured in Asia.
The four mullet genes, which shared characteristic features with their
counterparts in other teleosts, were ubiquitously expressed in all of the
examined tissues, albeit with different expression patterns. Following
Streptococcus dysgalactiae infection, the four genes were upregulated to
different degrees in various mullet tissues. These results indicated that the
four genes were involved in the mullet immune response to bacterial infection. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first characterization of these four genes
in mullet. Our results provide a basis for future studies of TLR signaling
pathways in mullet, as well as for similar studies in other mugilids.
