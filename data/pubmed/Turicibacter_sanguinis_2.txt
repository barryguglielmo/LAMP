The mammalian gut microbiome can potentially impact host health and disease
state. It is known that the mouse-genome, eating-behavior, and exercise-status
promotes higher taxonomic rank-level alterations (e.g. family to phyla-level) of 
the gut microbiota. Here, host genotype or activity status was investigated to
determine if selection of individual bacterial species or strains could be
discerned within the murine digestive system. For this study, the fecal bacterial
community of adenylyl cyclase 5 knock-out (AC5KO, n = 7) mice or their wild-type 
(WT, n = 10) littermates under exercise or sedentary conditions were profiled by 
sequencing rRNA operons. AC5KO mice were chosen since this genotype displays
enhanced longevity/exercise capacity and protects against
cardiovascular/metabolic disease. Profiling of rRNA operons using the Oxford
MinION yielded 65,706 2-D sequences (after size selection of 3.7-5.7 kb) which
were screened against an NCBI 16S rRNA gene database. These sequences were binned
into 1,566 different best BLAST hits (BBHs) and counted for each mouse sample.
Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) of the gut microbial community
demonstrated clustering by physical activity (p = 0.001) but not by host
genotype. Additionally, sequence similarity and phylogenetic analysis
demonstrated that different bacterial species (closely related to Muribaculum
intestinale and Parasutterella excrementihominis) inhabit AC5KO or WT mice
depending on activity status. Other bacterial species of the gut microbiota did
not follow such patterning (e.g. Turicibacter sanguinis and Turicimonas muris).
Our results support the need of improved taxonomic resolution for better
characterization of bacterial communities to deepen our understanding of the role
of the gut microbiome on host health.
