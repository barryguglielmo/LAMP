INTRODUCTION: Corynebacterium striatum is common contaminant in clinical
specimens. Here, we report a rare case of pyogenic tenosynovitis of the wrist
caused by C striatum in a dermatomyositis patient taking oral immunosuppressants.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 67-year-old Japanese woman with dermatomyositis had a history
of multiple intraarticular injections of corticosteroids to the right wrist joint
for the treatment of osteoarthritis. She was admitted to our hospital with a
painful lump on the right dorsal wrist lasting for three months. MRI revealed
cellulitis of the dorsum of the right wrist and hand and fluid collection in the 
extensor tendon sheath. C striatum was detected in the cultures of three samples 
of synovial fluid taken from the dorsal hand.
DIAGNOSIS: Pyogenic tenosynovitis of the wrist due to C striatum.
INTERVENTIONS: The infection was successfully controlled with synovectomy and
adjuvant antibiotic therapy.
OUTCOMES: There has been no sign of recurrence for 12-months after the surgical
treatment.
LESSONS: This is the first reported case of pyogenic tenosynovitis due to C
striatum in a patient with dermatomyositis. Clinicians should be aware that
patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy have a risk of C striatum
infection.
