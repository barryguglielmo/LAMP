The Mitis group of streptococci includes an important human pathogen,
Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) and about 20 other related species with
much lower pathogenicity. In clinical practice, some representatives of these
species, especially Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae and Streptococcus mitis, are
sometimes mistaken for S. pneumoniae based on the results of classical
microbiological methods, such as optochin susceptibility and bile solubility.
Several various molecular approaches that address the issue of correct
identification of pneumococci and other Mitis streptococci have been proposed and
are discussed in this review, including PCR- and gene sequencing-based tests as
well as new developments in the genomic field that represents an important
advance in our understanding of relationships within the Mitis group.
