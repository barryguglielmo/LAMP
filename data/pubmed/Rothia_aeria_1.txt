Acanthamoeba can cause visually destructive Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) in
contact lens (CL) users. The purpose of this study was to determine whether
Acanthamoeba was present in the CL cases of CL wearers and to develop techniques 
to prevent the contaminations. To accomplish this, 512 CL case samples were
collected from 305 healthy CL wearers. Using real-time PCR, Acanthamoeba DNA was 
detected in 19.1% of CL cases, however their presence was not directly associated
with poor CL case care. Instead, the presence of Acanthamoeba DNA was associated 
with significant levels of many different bacterial species. When the CL cases
underwent metagenomic analysis, the most abundant bacterial orders were
Enterobacteriales followed by Burkholderiales, Pseudomonadales, and
Flavobacteriales. The presence of Acanthamoeba was characterized by
Propionibacterium acnes and Rothia aeria and was also associated with an increase
in the α diversity. Collectively, Acanthamoeba contamination occurs when a
diversified bacterial flora is present in CL cases. This can effectively be
prevented by careful and thorough CL case care.
