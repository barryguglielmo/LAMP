Shigella is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that causes bacterial dysentery
called shigellosis. The assessment of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators
produced by immune cells against this bacteria are vital in identifying the
effectiveness of the immune reaction in protecting the host. In Malaysia,
Shigella is ranked as the third most common bacteria causing diarrheal disease
among children below 5 years old. In the present study, we aim to examine the
differential cytokine gene expressions of macrophages in response to two types of
clinical strains of Shigella flexneri 2a (S. flexneri 2a) isolated from patients 
admitted in Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kelantan, Malaysia. THP-1-derived
macrophages, as the model of human macrophages, were infected separately with S. 
flexneri 2a mild (SH062) and virulence (SH057) strains for 6, 12, and 24 h,
respectively. The gene expression level of inflammatory mediators was identified 
using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The production 
of nitric oxide (NO) by the macrophages was measured by using a commercialized NO
assay kit. The ability of macrophages to kill the intracellular bacteria was
assessed by intracellular killing assay. Induction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha
(TNFα), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-12, inducible NO synthase (iNOS), and NO,
confirmed the pro-inflammatory reaction of the THP-1-derived macrophages in
response to S. flexneri 2a, especially against the SH507 strain. The SH057 also
induced a marked increase in the expression levels of the anti-inflammatory
cytokine mRNAs at 12 h and 24 h post-infection. In the intracellular killing
assay, both strains showed less viable, indicating the generation of
pro-inflammatory cytokines in the presence of iNOS and NO was crucial in the
stimulation of macrophages for the host defense against shigellosis.
Transcription analysis of THP-1-derived macrophages in this study identifies
differentially expressed cytokine genes that correlated with the virulence factor
of S. flexneri 2a.
