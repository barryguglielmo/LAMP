BACKGROUND: To investigate the genetic diversity of Haemophilus influenzae
positive samples among French pilgrims attending the 2018 Hajj pilgrimage.
METHOD: After screening by qPCR, multilocus sequence typing was performed for all
H. influenzae-positive samples. The following housekeeping genes were amplified
and assigned: adk, atpG, frdB, fucK, mdh, pgi and recA.
RESULTS: 121 pilgrims were included. H. influenzae was positive in 35.5% pre-Hajj
samples, 12.4% at day five post-arrival, 15.7% at day 12 post-arrival, and 43.0% 
post-Hajj. Of the 129 positive swabs for H. influenzae, only one sample at D12
was negative for all seven genes amplified by standard PCR. The adk, atpG, frdB, 
mdh, pgi, recA and fucK genes were positive in 123, 107, 122, 70, 127, 118 and 69
samples, respectively. One sequence of atpG and two of recA genes were not
possible to assign. None of the sequences of fucK gene was successfully obtained.
Consequently, a complete sequence type characterisation was not possible. Of the 
128 obtained strains, 111 had distinct patterns of alleles.
CONCLUSION: H. influenzae genotypes acquired were completely different from those
present at pre-Hajj. We observed a great biodiversity and a lack of clonality of 
H. influenzae among French pilgrims during the 2018 Hajj. Further studies aiming 
at studying the genome of Hajj-acquired H. influenzae isolates are needed to
define the clinical burden of H. influenzae infection during Hajj and to evaluate
the potential interest of vaccination in Hajj pilgrims.
