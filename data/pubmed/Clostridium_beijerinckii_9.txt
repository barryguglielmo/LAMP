The production of acetone-butanol-ethanol by solventogenic Clostridium using
lignocellulosic biomass can be a potential alternative to petroleum-based
butanol. However, previous studies on nondetoxified lignocellulose hydrolysate
could not provide better results when compared to those in synthetic medium. In
this study, we engineered the pentose pathway of Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB
8052, which was then subjected to adaptive laboratory evolution in the gradient
mixture of synthetic medium and pretreated corn stover enzymatic hydrolysate
(CSH) prepared according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)
standard. The final resultant strain CIBTS1274A produced 20.7 g/L of total
solvents in NREL CSH diluted to 6% initial total sugars, supplemented with
ammonium acetate. This performance was comparable with that of corn-based
butanol. In addition, this strain was successfully used in the scale-up operation
using nondetoxified corn stover and corncob hydrolysate at Lignicell Refining
Biotechnologies Ltd., which once was the only commercial biobutanol industry in
the world.
