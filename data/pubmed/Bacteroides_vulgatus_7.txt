Glycans are involved in various life processes and represent critical targets of 
biomedical developments. Nevertheless, the accessibility to long glycans with
precise structures remains challenging. Here we report on the synthesis of
glycans consisting of [→4)-α-Rha-(1 → 3)-β-Man-(1 → ] repeating unit, which are
relevant to the O-antigen of Bacteroides vulgatus, a common component of gut
microbiota. The optimal combination of assembly strategy, protecting group
arrangement, and glycosylation reaction has enabled us to synthesize up to a
128-mer glycan. The synthetic glycans are accurately characterized by advanced
NMR and MS approaches, the 3D structures are defined, and their potent binding
activity with human DC-SIGN, a receptor associated with the gut lymphoid tissue, 
is disclosed.
