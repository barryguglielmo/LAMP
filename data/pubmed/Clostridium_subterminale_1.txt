Uncontrolled oxidative stress, reported in Salmonella and HIV infections,
colorectal cancer or severe acute malnutrition, has been associated with
anaerobic gut microbiome alteration, impaired butyrate production, mucosal
immunity dysregulation and disruption of host-bacterial mutualism. However, the
role of major antioxidant molecules in the human body, such as glutathione,
ascorbic acid and uric acid, has been neglected in this context. Here, we
performed an in vitro metabolomics study of the 3 most odorous anaerobic microbes
isolated from the human gut in our laboratory (Clostridium sporogenes,
Clostridium subterminale and Romboutsia lituseburensis) when grown in
anaerobiosis or in aerobiosis with these 3 antioxidant molecules via gas and
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS and LC/MS). There was no growth or
volatile organic compound production in aerobic cultures without the 3
antioxidant molecules. In anaerobiosis, the major metabolic products of the
bacteria were thiols, alcohols and short-chain fatty acid esters. The production 
of alkanes, cycloheptatriene and, paradoxically, increased butyrate production,
was observed in the cultures grown in aerobiosis with the 3 antioxidant
molecules. The qualitative shift suggests specific molecular mechanisms that
remain to be elucidated. The increased production of butyrate, but also
isobutyrate and isovalerate in vitro suggests that these 3 antioxidant molecules 
contributed to the maintenance and active resilience of host-bacterial mutualism 
against mucosal oxygen and uncontrolled oxidative stress in vivo.
