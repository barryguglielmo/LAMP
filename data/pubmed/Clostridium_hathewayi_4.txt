Unruptured intracranial aneurysm (UIA) is a life-threatening cerebrovascular
condition. Whether changes in gut microbial composition participate in the
development of UIAs remains largely unknown. We perform a case-control
metagenome-wide association study in two cohorts of Chinese UIA patients and
control individuals and mice that receive fecal transplants from human donors.
After fecal transplantation, the UIA microbiota is sufficient to induce UIAs in
mice. We identify UIA-associated gut microbial species link to changes in
circulating taurine. Specifically, the abundance of Hungatella hathewayi is
markedly decreased and positively correlated with the circulating taurine
concentration in both humans and mice. Consistently, gavage with H. hathewayi
normalizes the taurine levels in serum and protects mice against the formation
and rupture of intracranial aneurysms. Taurine supplementation also reverses the 
progression of intracranial aneurysms. Our findings provide insights into a
potential role of H. hathewayi-associated taurine depletion as a key factor in
the pathogenesis of UIAs.
