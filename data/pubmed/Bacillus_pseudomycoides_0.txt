Bacterial lasso peptides are made from linear ribosomally synthesized precursors 
by specific cleavage at the leader-core junction site of the precursor by a
dedicated protease recognizing the leader, followed by cyclisation of the newly
formed N-terminus of the core part with a side chain of the internal aspartic or 
glutamic residue catalyzed by a macrolactam synthetase. The resulting structure
has a tail that is threaded and fixed inside the cycle formed. Here, we
characterize a new lasso peptide, pseudomycoidin, encoded by Bacillus
pseudomycoides DSM 12442. The most surprising and unique feature of
pseudomycoidin is that it can be produced in vivo from the ribosomally
synthesized core part by a macrolactam synthetase, in the absence of the leader
protease. The minimalism of the pseudomycoidin synthesis system makes it a
powerful model to generate pseudomycoidin-based lasso-peptide libraries and to
study the poorly understood process of lasso formation. We detected two
additional pseudomycoidin modifications: phosphorylation of a terminal residue
that was previously observed in another lasso peptide, followed by glycosylation,
which was not observed heretofore. We speculate that these bulky C-terminal
modifications may help maintain the threaded lasso topology of the compound
synthesized by the macrolactam synthetase.
