This work describes the wettability and biological performance of Zn- and
Cu-containing CaP-based coatings prepared by micro-arc oxidation on pure titanium
(Ti) and novel Ti-40Nb alloy. Good hydrophilic properties of all the coatings
were demonstrated by the low contact angles with liquids, not exceeding 45°. An
increase in the applied voltage led to an increase of the coating roughness and
porosity, thereby reducing the contact angles to 6° with water and to 17° with
glycerol. The free surface energy of 75 ± 3 mJ/m2 for all the coatings were
determined. Polar component was calculated as the main component of surface
energy, caused by the presence of strong polar PO43- and OH- bonds. In vitro
studies showed that low Cu and Zn amounts (~0.4 at.%) in the coatings promoted
high motility of human adipose-derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells
(hAMMSC) on the implant/cell interface and subsequent cell ability to
differentiate into osteoblasts. In vivo study demonstrated 100% ectopic bone
formation only on the surface of the CaP coating on Ti. The Zn- and Cu-containing
CaP coatings on both substrates and the CaP coating on the Ti-40Nb alloy slightly
decreased the incidence of ectopic osteogenesis down to 67%. The MAO coatings
showed antibacterial efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus and can be arranged
as follows: Zn-CaP/Ti > Cu-CaP/TiNb, Zn-CaP/TiNb > Cu-CaP/Ti.
