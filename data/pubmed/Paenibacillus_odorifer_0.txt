BACKGROUND: GH74 xyloglucanases are composed of two separate domains connected by
two unstructured peptides. Previously, a hypothesis was made that the movement of
domains may affect the enzyme mechanism of catalysis.
METHODS: The molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of endo-processive
xyloglucanases from Paenibacillus odorifer (PoGH74cat) and Myceliophthora
thermophila (MtXeg74A) were carried out.
RESULTS: MD simulations for both enzymes in complex with XXLG and XGXXLG
oligosaccharides confirmed the possibility of domain movement. In the case of
MtXeg74A, changes in the distances between Cα atoms of aromatic residues involved
in xyloglucan binding in -3 and +3 subsites of the active site cleft and those of
selected residues on the opposite side of the cleft reached values up to 10-12 Å.
For PoGH74cat the conformational changes were less pronounced. In MtXeg74A
variants, the deletion of loop 1, which partially closes the entrance to the
cleft, and the additional double mutation of two Trp residues in +3 and +5
subsites caused the enhanced mobility of the XGXXLG and also induced changes in
topography of the cleft.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the possibility of existence of GH74
xyloglucanases in a more open and more closed enzyme conformation. The enzyme in 
an open conformation may more easily accommodate the branched polysaccharide,
while its transition to the closed conformation, together with loop 1 function,
should aid processivity.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Our results provide an insight into a mechanism of action
of GH74 xyloglucanases and may be useful for discussing the catalytic mechanisms 
of glycoside hydrolases from other families.
