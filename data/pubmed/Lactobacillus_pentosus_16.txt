In this study, three strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Tibetan kefir 
grains, including two strains of Lactobacillus pentosus LZ-R-17 and L. helveticus
LZ-R-5, and one strain of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis LZ-R-12. The ability
of three strains to produce exopolysaccharide (EPS) was tested, and L. pentosus
LZ-R-17 was found to have the highest EPS yield. One EPS (R-17-EPS) was isolated 
from the fermented milk by L. pentosus LZ-R-17 and purified by DEAE-52 anion
exchange chromatography. Furthermore, R-17-EPS preliminary structure and
macrophage immunomodulatory activity in vitro were investigated. On the basis of 
the analytical results of ultraviolet-visible spectrum, Fourier
transform-infrared spectrum, monosaccharide composition analysis and
one-dimensional and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra,
R-17-EPS was found to have an average molecular weight of 1.20 × 106 Da and was
composed of galactose and glucose residues with a molar ratio of 1.00:3.15. NMR
analysis revealed that the R-17-EPS was a linear hetero-galactoglucan containing 
repeating units of
→2)-α-D-Galp-(1 → 4)-β-D-Glcp-(1 → 4)-β-D-Glcp-(1 → 4)-β-D-Glcp-(1→. In addition,
R-17-EPS could effectively enhanced the proliferation, phagocytosis, nitric oxide
and cytokines production of RAW264.7 cells, suggesting that R-17-EPS had potent
immunostimulatory activity and could be explored as immunomodulator in functional
food and/or medicine fields.
