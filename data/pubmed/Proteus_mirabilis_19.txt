PURPOSE: To characterize the risk factors, clinical presentations, management
choices, and outcomes of Proteus mirabilis keratitis.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, 26 culture-proven cases of P. mirabilis
infections were diagnosed and treated between 1998 and 2019 at the University of 
Pittsburgh Medical Center. Medical records were available for 14 keratitis cases 
and were reviewed for demographic information, ocular risk factors, and treatment
outcomes.
RESULTS: Sixteen eyes of 14 patients were included in the study. The average age 
was 47.8 ± 19.3 years, with a median follow-up time of 6 months. The most common 
ocular risk factors were poor ocular surface and contact lens use in 57.1% and
42.9% of cases, respectively. Eleven of the 14 patients (78.6%) had positive
corneal cultures, and 13 of the 14 patients (92.9%) had positive conjunctiva or
eyelid cultures. All isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin,
moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and cefazolin. Surgical intervention was required in 
4 patients (28.6%). Average LogMAR visual acuity was 1.3 ± 1.0 at presentation
and 0.9 6 ± 1.0 at the most recent follow-up visit.
CONCLUSIONS: Proteus mirabilis is an uncommon cause of microbial keratitis.
Patients with poor ocular surface and those who use contact lens are at increased
risk for developing this cause of keratitis. Empiric treatment with fortified
antibiotics or fluoroquinolones seemed to provide effective coverage for P.
mirabilis.
