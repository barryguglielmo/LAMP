BACKGROUND: The Oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) (Diptera:
Tephritidae), is an important polyphagous pest of horticultural produce. The
sterile insect technique (SIT) is a proven control method against many insect
pests, including fruit flies, under area-wide pest management programs. High
quality mass-rearing process and the cost-effective production of sterile target 
species are important for SIT. Irradiation is reported to cause severe damage to 
the symbiotic community structure in the mid gut of fruit fly species, impairing 
SIT success. However, studies have found that target-specific manipulation of
insect gut bacteria can positively impact the overall fitness of SIT-specific
insects.
RESULTS: Twelve bacterial genera were isolated and identified from B. dorsalis
eggs, third instars larval gut and adults gut. The bacterial genera were
Acinetobacter, Alcaligenes, Citrobacter, Pseudomonas, Proteus, and
Stenotrophomonas, belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family. Larval diet
enrichment with the selected bacterial isolate, Proteus sp. was found to improve 
adult emergence, percentage of male, and survival under stress. However, no
significant changes were recorded in B. dorsalis egg hatching, pupal yield, pupal
weight, duration of the larval stage, or flight ability.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that gut bacterial isolates
can be used in conjunction with SIT. The newly developed gel-based larval diet
incorporated with Proteus sp. isolates can be used for large-scale mass rearing
of B. dorsalis in the SIT program.
