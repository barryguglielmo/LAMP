The genus Clostridium is among the largest bacterial genera comprising of about
180 species.[1] The more common clinically relevant Clostridium species are
Clostridium botulinum, which causes botulism; Clostridium perfringens, which
causes food poisoning, gas gangrene, and necrotizing fasciitis; Clostridium
tetani which cause tetanus and Clostridium sordellii which causes fatal
infections after medical abortions. Here we will be reviewing the Clostridium
botulinum organism, which is an anaerobic gram-positive spore-forming rod and is 
the most common cause implicated in reversible flaccid paralysis. Other
clostridial bacteria can also produce the toxin leading to botulism. Despite its 
potential fatality and rarity, the illness can masquerade as other illnesses
making the diagnosis difficult. Several studies show that the secretion of the
submandibular gland (SMG) inhibited by botulinum toxin A (BTXA). Toxicity is
detectable on the rat SMG-C6 cell line.[2]
