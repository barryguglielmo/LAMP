The aim of the present study was to evaluate mannan oligosaccharides (MOS) or
glycerol (GLY) as a carbon source on biofloc systems of Nile tilapia (O.
niloticus) juveniles. Fish (n = 750) were reared in open flow (Controls) or
biofloc systems (B-GLY and B-MOS) fed with a plant or fish protein source over a 
period of twelve weeks. Total ammonia nitrogen and nitrate decreased in the
biofloc groups, while biofloc volume increased in B-MOS. Compared to the
controls, B-MOS and B-GLY exhibited higher weight gain and improved feed
conversion, irrespectively of the diet. Serum level of C-reactive protein was
reduced, while IgM and lysozyme activity was higher in the B-MOS fish, compared
to other groups. Intestinal Bacillus spp. count was increased, whereas Vibrio,
Aeromonas and Pseudomonas spp. counts decreased in B-MOS reared groups, compared 
to the other groups. The proinflammatory cytokine (IL-8 and IFN-Î³) transcript
expression was upregulated in B-MOS more than B-GLY reared groups. Compared to
the controls, the virulence of Aeromonas hydrophila was decreased in the B-MOS
and B-GLY groups. The results indicate several benefits of using MOS as a carbon 
source in a biofloc Nile tilapia system; a cost benefit analysis is required to
assess the economic viability of this.
