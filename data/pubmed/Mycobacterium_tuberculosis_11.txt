A series of 5,8-disubstituted tetrahydroisoquinolines were shown to be effective 
inhibitors of M. tb in culture and modest inhibitors of M. tb ATP synthase. There
was a broad general trend of improved potency with higher lipophilicity. Large
substituents (e.g., Bn) at the tetrahydroquinoline 5-position were
well-tolerated, while N-methylpiperazine was the preferred 8-substituent.
Structure-activity relationships for 7-linked side chains showed that the nature 
of the 7-linking group was important; -CO- and -COCH2- linkers were less
effective than -CH2- or -CONH- ones. This suggests that the positioning of a
terminal aromatic ring is important for target binding. Selected compounds showed
much faster rates of microsomal clearance than did the clinical ATP synthase
inhibitor bedaquiline, and modest inhibition of mycobacterial ATP synthase.
