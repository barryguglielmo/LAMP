Quorum sensing is a density-dependent chemical process between bacteria, which
may be intergenus or intragenus. N-acyl homoserine lactones (HSLs) are a type of 
small signaling molecules associated with Gram-negative bacteria for monitoring
their own population density. The present study unveils the mechanism of HSLs in 
Achromobacter denitrificans SP1 while transforming di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate
(DEHP) into prodigiosin in a simple basal salt medium. The primary detection of
HSLs was done by the colorimetric method. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy
and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-quadrupole time-of-flight confirmed
and identified the HSLs. The maximum production of HSLs was observed between 24
and 72 h of incubation, which is noted to be a peak time of DEHP degradation. A
total of 57.2% of DEHP was degraded within 30 h and complete degradation was
observed within 72 h of incubation. Regulation in the synthesis of various
acyl-HSL molecules, viz. 3OC6-HSL in the initial stage of DEHP stress, 3OC8-HSL, 
and C10-HSL during the time of degradation and 3OC12-HSL on completion of
degradation was noticed. The role of HSLs on the production of prodigiosin was
confirmed using vanillin as an HSL inhibitor. Through the selective activation of
HSL molecules, A. denitrificans SP1 sustain the changing stressful conditions.
Supplementation of acyl-HSL signal molecules may boost up the efficacy of A.
denitrificans SP1 in both DEHP degradation and prodigiosin production which
offers great potential towards the management of DEHP containing plastic wastes.
