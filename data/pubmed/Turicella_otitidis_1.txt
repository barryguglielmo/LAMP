Lymphoma.

BACKGROUND: Invasive Gram-positive bacilli infections are commonly encountered in
immunocompromised patients. In this paper, we report a bacteremia caused by
Turicella otitidis in a patient with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
METHODS: Bacteria was identified by VITEK MALDI-TOF MS. Drug sensitivity was
analyzed by disk diffusion method.
RESULTS: MALDI-TOF MS data demonstrated that the infection bacteria was Turicella
otitidis. Drug susceptibility data showed that Turicella otitidis was possibly
sensitive to vancomycin, polymyxin B, and chloramphenicol. Body temperature of
the patient dropped after administration of vancomycin. The data indicated that
vancomycin could be used to treat the infections caused by Turicella otitidis.
CONCLUSIONS: MALDI-TOF MS can be used for the rapid and accurate identification
of Turicella otitidis. Vancomycin can be used to treat the infection caused by
Turicella otitidis. This study may provide a reference for the diagnosis and
treatment of Turicella otitidis.
