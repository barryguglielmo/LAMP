Here, we report the genome sequence of the megaplasmid-bearing Staphylococcus
sciuri strain B9-58B, isolated from retail pork. This strain contains a
2,761,440-bp chromosome and a 162,858-bp megaplasmid. The genome contains
putative genes involved in virulence, the stress response, and antimicrobial
agent and heavy metal resistance.
