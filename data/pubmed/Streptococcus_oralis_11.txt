Objectives: This study aims to investigate the effects of various mouthwashes on 
bacteremia development following a debonding process, which is performed after
orthodontic treatment.
Subjects and Methods: The study included patients who received fixed orthodontic 
treatment and were indicated for debonding. A total of 40 patients in four groups
were selected for the study; no mouthwash (Group 1), mouthwash containing 0.12%
chlorhexidine-gluconate (Group 2), mouthwash containing essential-oils (Group 3),
and mouthwash containing 7.5% povidone-iodine (Group 4). Before (T0) and
following (T1) the debonding procedure, blood samples were obtained from the
patients. Then, the blood samples were placed in blood culture bottles to
investigate bacterial growth.
Results: Based on the results of the study, it was determined that the blood
samples obtained at T0did not indicate any bacterial growth. Furthermore, it was 
observed that the blood samples obtained at T1included Streptococcus viridans,
Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mutans, and Staphylococcus aereus growth,
respectively, in 4 patients from Group 1 while Streptococcus salivarius growth
was observed in 1 patient from Group 3 in addition to Streptococcus mitis growth 
in 1 patient from Group 4. No bacterial growth was observed in Group 2. While the
results obtained between Group 1 and Group 2 were statistically significant, no
statistically significant difference was observed between other groups.
Conclusions: Finally, it was determined that the mouthwash 0.12%
chlorhexidine-gluconate was statistically significant in comparison to the
control group. It can be concluded that this mouthwash can be used to decrease
bacterial density in oral flora before debonding procedures.
