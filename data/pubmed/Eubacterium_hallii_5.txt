BACKGROUND: In animal studies early life antibiotic exposure causes metabolic
abnormalities including obesity through microbiota disruption, but evidence from 
human studies is scarce. We examined involvement of gut microbiota in the
associations between infant antibiotic exposure and childhood adiposity.
METHODS: Infant antibiotic exposure in the first year of life was ascertained
using parental reports during interviewer-administered questionnaires. Primary
outcomes were childhood obesity [body mass index (BMI) z-score > 95th percentile]
and adiposity [abdominal circumference (AC) and skinfold (triceps + subscapular
(SST)) measurements] determined from ages 15-60 months. At age 24 months, when
the gut microbiota are more stable, stool samples (n = 392) were collected for
the gut microbiota profiling using co-abundancy networks. Associations of
antibiotic exposure with obesity and adiposity (n = 1016) were assessed using
multiple logistic and linear mixed effects regressions. Key bacteria associated
with antibiotics exposure were identified by partial redundancy analysis and
multivariate association with linear models.
RESULTS: Antibiotic exposure was reported in 38% of study infants. In a fully
adjusted model, a higher odds of obesity from 15-60 months of age was observed
for any antibiotic exposure [OR(95% CI) = 1.45(1.001, 2.14)] and exposure to ≥3
courses of antibiotics [2.78(1.12, 6.87)]. For continuous adiposity indicators,
any antibiotic exposure was associated with higher BMI z-score in boys
[β = 0.15(0.01, 0.28)] but not girls [β = -0.04(-0.19, 0.11)] (P
interaction = 0.026). Similarly, exposure to ≥3 courses of antibiotics was
associated with higher AC in boys [1.15(0.05, 2.26) cm] but not girls
[0.57(-1.32, 2.45) cm] (P interaction not significant). Repeated exposure to
antibiotics was associated with a significant reduction (FDR-corrected P
values < 0.05) in a microbial co-abundant group (CAG) represented by Eubacterium 
hallii, whose proportion was negatively correlated with childhood adiposity.
Meanwhile, a CAG represented by Tyzzerella 4 was positively correlated with the
repeated use of antibiotics and childhood adiposity.
CONCLUSIONS: Infant antibiotic exposure was associated with disruption of the gut
microbiota and the higher risks of childhood obesity and increased adiposity.
