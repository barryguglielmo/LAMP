Cellulose binding modules (CBMs) are found widely in different proteins that act 
on cellulose. Because they allow a very easy way of binding recombinant proteins 
to cellulose, they have become widespread in many biotechnological applications
involving cellulose. One commonly used variant is the CBMCipA from Clostridium
thermocellum. Here we studied the oligomerization behavior of CBMCipA, as such
solution association may have an impact on its use. As the principal approach, we
used sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium analytical
ultracentrifugation. To enhance our understanding of the possible interactions,
we used molecular dynamics simulations. By analysis of the sedimentation velocity
data by a discrete model genetic algorithm and by building a binding isotherm
based on weight average sedimentation coefficient and by global fitting of
sedimentation equilibrium data we found that the CBMCipA shows a weak
dimerization interaction with a dissociation constant KD of 90 ± 30 μM. As the KD
of CBMCipA binding to cellulose is below 1 μM, we conclude that the dimerization 
is unlikely to affect cellulose binding. However, at high concentrations used in 
some applications of the CBMCipA, its dimerization is likely to have a marked
effect on its solution behavior.
