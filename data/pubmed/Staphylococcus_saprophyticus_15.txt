ABSTRACT: The prevalence and diversity of Staphylococcus species from wild
European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in the Azores were investigated, and the
antibiotic resistance phenotype and genotype of the isolates were determined.
Nasal samples from 77 wild European rabbits from São Jorge and São Miguel islands
in Azores were examined. Antibiotic susceptibility of the isolates was determined
using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method, and the presence of antimicrobial
resistance genes and virulence factors was determined by PCR. The genetic
lineages of S. aureus isolates were characterized by spa typing and multilocus
sequence typing. A total of 49 staphylococci were obtained from 35 of the 77 wild
rabbits. Both coagulase-positive (8.2%) and coagulase-negative (91.8%)
staphylococci were detected: 4 S. aureus, 17 S. fleurettii, 13 S. sciuri, 7 S.
xylosus, 4 S. epidermidis, and 1 each of S. simulans, S. saprophyticus, S.
succinus, and S. equorum. The four S. aureus isolates showed methicillin
susceptibility and were characterized as spa type t272/CC121, Panton-Valentine
leukocidin negative, and hlB positive. Most of the coagulase-negative
staphylococci showed resistance to fusidic acid and beta-lactams, and multidrug
resistance was identified especially among S. epidermidis isolates. The mecA gene
was detected in 20 isolates of the species S. fleurettii and S. epidermidis,
associated with the blaZ gene in one S. epidermidis isolate. Five antimicrobial
resistance genes were detected in one S. epidermidis isolate
(mecA,dfrA,dfrG,aac6'-aph2'', and ant4). Our results highlight that wild rabbits 
are reservoirs or "temporary hosts" of Staphylococcus species with zoonotic
potential, some of them carrying relevant antimicrobial resistances.
