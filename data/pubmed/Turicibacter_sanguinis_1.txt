Turicibacter sanguinis MOL361 (DSM 14220) is the reference and type strain for
the Turicibacter genus, commonly found in the intestinal tract of animal species.
Long-read sequencing was performed on this strain to complement publicly
available Illumina HiSeq-based data, producing a complete annotated genome
sequence.
