Vibrio cholerae, causative agent of the water-borne disease cholera still
threatens a large proportion of world's population. The major biotypes of the
pathogen are classical and El Tor. There have been recent reports of variant V.
cholerae strains circulating around the world. In the present study, the
epidemiological status of V. cholerae strains circulating in the country over a
decade was assessed. Also, a comprehensive analysis of the difference in
pathogenicity between the different biotypes of V. cholerae strains was evaluated
both in-vitro and in-vivo. The amount of CT produced by different biotypes of V. 
cholerae strains were analyzed by GM1 ELISA and the probable reasons for the
difference in toxin production was discussed. MLST analysis grouped the isolates 
into a single Sequence Type (ST 69) whereas PFGE analysis clustered the isolates 
into ten different pulsotypes revealing molecular diversity. The circulating
strains were identified to produce cholera toxin and CT mRNA intermediate to the 
classical and prototype El Tor strains. Also, the circulating strains were
identified to possess four ToxR binding sequences. In-vivo pathogenicity analysis
by rabbit ileal loop fluid accumulation assay revealed the Haitian variant
strains to be more hyperemic than the prototype strains.
