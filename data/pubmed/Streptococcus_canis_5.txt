The draft genomes of seven Streptococcus canis isolates from diseased dogs and
cats in Japan are reported here. The genome sizes ranged from 1.901 Mbp to 2.203 
Mbp, with G+C contents of 39.5% to 39.8%. The sequence types, antimicrobial
resistance genotypes, and S. canis M-like protein alleles were all characterized.
