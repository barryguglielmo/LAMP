Existing antibiotics are inadequate to defeat tuberculosis (TB), a leading cause 
of death worldwide. We sought potential targets for host-directed therapies
(HDTs) by investigating the host immune response to mycobacterial infection. We
used high-throughput CRISPR knockout and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screens to
identify perturbations that improve the survival of human phagocytic cells
infected with Mycobacterium bovis BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin), as a proxy for 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Many of these perturbations constrained the
growth of intracellular mycobacteria. We identified over 100 genes associated
with diverse biological pathways as potential HDT targets. We validated key
components of the type I interferon and aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling
pathways that respond to the small-molecule inhibitors cerdulatinib and CH223191,
respectively; these inhibitors enhanced human macrophage survival and limited the
intracellular growth of Mtb. Thus, high-throughput functional genomic screens, by
elucidating highly complex host-pathogen interactions, can serve to identify HDTs
to potentially improve TB treatment.
