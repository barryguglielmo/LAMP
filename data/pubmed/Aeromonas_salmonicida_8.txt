Aeromonas salmonicida is a gram-negative bacterium that is the causative agent of
furunculosis. An A. salmonicida strain was isolated from diseased turbot
(Scophthalmus maximus) with the sign of furunculosis from North China. Based on
vapA gene, the strain was further classified as A. salmonicida subsp. masoucida
RZ6S-1. Culturing RZ6S-1 strain at high temperature (28°C) obtained the virulence
attenuated strain RZ6S. Genome sequence comparison between the two strains
revealed the loss of the type IV secretion system (T4SS) and type III secretion
system (T3SS) from the native plasmid pAsmB-1 and pAsmC-1 of wild-type strain
RZ6S-1, respectively. Further study demonstrated that the wild-type strain
RZ6S-1, but not its derivative mutant RZ6S, can stimulate apoptosis. Elevated
protein level of cleaved caspase-3 was detected from epithelioma papulosum
cyprinid (EPC) cells infected with wild-type strain RZ6S-1 as compared with that 
infected with RZ6S strain. Meanwhile, the invasion of the mutant strain RZ6S was 
about 17-fold higher than the wild-type strain RZ6S-1, suggesting that some
protein(s) from A. salmonicida subsp. masoucida RZ6S-1 suppress its invasion. The
RZ6S mutant strain was attenuated, since its LD50 is over 10,000 times higher
compared to the wild-type strain as revealed in the turbot infection model.
