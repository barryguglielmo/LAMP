The toxin-producing bacterium Bacillus cereus is an important and neglected human
pathogen and a common cause of food poisoning. Several toxins have been
implicated in disease, including the pore-forming toxins hemolysin BL (HBL) and
nonhemolytic enterotoxin (NHE). Recent work revealed that HBL binds to the
mammalian surface receptors LITAF and CDIP1 and that both HBL and NHE induce
potassium efflux and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to pyroptosis.
These mammalian receptors, in part, contribute to inflammation and pathology.
Other putative virulence factors of B. cereus include cytotoxin K, cereulide,
metalloproteases, sphingomyelinase, and phospholipases. In this review, we
highlight the latest progress in our understanding of B. cereus biology,
epidemiology, and pathogenesis, and discuss potential new directions for research
in this field.
