Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a form of diffuse lung injury with 
many potential etiologies, pneumonia being the most common cause developing
outside of the hospital. Foreign body (FB) aspiration is a risk factor for
pneumonia, and therefore, ARDS. Although these associations exist, the
development of ARDS immediately following the removal of an aspirated FB appears 
quite rare. We present the case of an 11 year old male who was found to have a
right-sided, post-obstructive pneumonia secondary to an aspirated FB obstructing 
the bronchus intermedius. Relief of the obstruction allowed for rapid,
endobronchial spread of infection and within 6 hours of FB removal, our patient
developed severe ARDS requiring initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
(ECMO). Streptococcus constellatus was isolated from lower respiratory cultures
obtained during initial bronchoscopy.
