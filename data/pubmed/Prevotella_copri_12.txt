Secretory Ig A (sIgA) plays an important role in the maintenance of intestinal
homeostasis via cross-talk with gut microbiota. The defects in sIgA production
could elicit dysbiosis of commensal microbiota and subsequently facilitate the
development of inflammatory bowel disease. Our previous study revealed activating
transcription factor 3 (ATF3) as an important regulator of follicular helper T
(TFH) cells in gut. ATF3 deficiency in CD4+ T cells impaired the development of
gut TFH cells, and therefore diminished sIgA production, which increased the
susceptibility to murine colitis. However, the potential role of microbiota in
ATF3-mediated gut homeostasis remains incompletely understood. In this study, we 
report that both Atf3-/- and CD4creAtf3fl/fl mice displayed profound dysbiosis of
gut microbiota when compared with their littermate controls. The proinflammatory 
Prevotella taxa, especially Prevotella copri, were more abundant in
ATF3-deficient mice when compared with littermate controls. This phenotype was
obviously abrogated by adoptive transfer of either TFH cells or IgA+ B cells.
Importantly, depletion of gut microbiota dramatically alleviated the severity of 
colitis in Atf3-/- mice, whereas transfer of microbiota from Atf3-/- mice to
wild-type recipients increased their susceptibility to colitis. Collectively,
these observations indicate the importance of IgA-microbiota interaction in
ATF3-mediated gut homeostasis.
