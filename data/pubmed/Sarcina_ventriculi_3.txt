Disabled individuals may be at risk for common and rare infections. We report on 
a 13-year-old female who had a diagnosis of phenylketonuria (PKU). The child
received a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding tube at five years
of age for the supplementation of her specialized formula. After eight years, she
no longer required the gastrostomy tube for formula supplementation, and she
presented for the closure of the gastrocutaneous fistula tract. The histological 
examination revealed acute and chronic inflammation and colonization by
gram-positive bacteria with a characteristic tetrad packet arrangement known as
Clostridium ventriculi (formerly Sarcina ventriculi). A review of the literature 
evidenced the rarity of this infection in children. This patient is the 11th case
of such infection in literature, and the first patient affected with PKU.
Physically and mentally disabled children are particularly vulnerable to
infection because of their different feeding abilities, toilet needs, and
sanitary arrangements.
