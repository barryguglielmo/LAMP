BACKGROUND: Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is the most common cancer type of the
biliary tract, and an association has been found between chronic calculous
cholecystitis (CCC) and an increased incidence of GBC mortality. An understanding
of the relationship between CCC and its carcinogenesis may enable us to prevent
and cure GBC. In this study, we attempted to explore changes in the microbiome
profile that take place during the transition from chronic cholecystitis mucosa
to malignant lesions.
RESULTS: Seven paired human GBC and CCC samples were provided by patients who had
undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy or radical cholecystectomy. Mucosal DNA
extraction and metagenomic sequencing were performed to evaluate changes in the
microbiota between the two groups. We found that GBC patients and CCC patients
shared similar stable and permanent dominant species and showed apparent
differences in their biliary microbial composition and gene function.
Peptostreptococcus stomatis and Enterococcus faecium may potentially play a role 
in GBC progression. In addition, the metagenomic species profiles, co-abundance
and co-exclusion correlations, and CAZyme prevalence showed significant
differences between the CCC and GBC groups.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggested that changes in the microbiota between CCC and GBC
may help deepen our understanding of the complex spectrum of different
microbiotas involved in the development of GBC. Although the cohort size was
small, this study has presented the first evidence of the existence of an altered
biliary microbiota in GBC, which is clearly different from that in CCC patients.
