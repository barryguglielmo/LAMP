BACKGROUND: Nitrogen is an essential element for sugarcane growth and development
and is generally applied in the form of urea often much more than at recommended 
rates, causing serious soil degradation, particularly soil acidification, as well
as groundwater and air pollution. In spite of the importance of nitrogen for
plant growth, fewer reports are available to understand the application and
biological role of N2 fixing bacteria to improve N2 nutrition in the sugarcane
plant.
RESULTS: In this study, a total of 350 different bacterial strains were isolated 
from rhizospheric soil samples of the sugarcane plants. Out of these, 22 isolates
were selected based on plant growth promotion traits, biocontrol, and nitrogenase
activity. The presence and activity of the nifH gene and the ability of
nitrogen-fixation proved that all 22 selected strains have the ability to fix
nitrogen. These strains were used to perform 16S rRNA and rpoB genes for their
identification. The resulted amplicons were sequenced and phylogenetic analysis
was constructed. Among the screened strains for nitrogen fixation, CY5 (Bacillus 
megaterium) and CA1 (Bacillus mycoides) were the most prominent. These two
strains were examined for functional diversity using Biolog phenotyping, which
confirmed the consumption of diverse carbon and nitrogen sources and tolerance to
low pH and osmotic stress. The inoculated bacterial strains colonized the
sugarcane rhizosphere successfully and were mostly located in root and leaf. The 
expression of the nifH gene in both sugarcane varieties (GT11 and GXB9)
inoculated with CY5 and CA1 was confirmed. The gene expression studies showed
enhanced expression of genes of various enzymes such as catalase,
phenylalanine-ammonia-lyase, superoxide dismutase, chitinase and glucanase in
bacterial-inoculated sugarcane plants.
CONCLUSION: The results showed that a substantial number of Bacillus isolates
have N-fixation and biocontrol property against two sugarcane pathogens
Sporisorium scitamineum and Ceratocystis paradoxa. The increased activity of
genes controlling free radical metabolism may at least in part accounts for the
increased tolerance to pathogens. Nitrogen-fixation was confirmed in sugarcane
inoculated with B. megaterium and B. mycoides strains using N-balance and 15N2
isotope dilution in different plant parts of sugarcane. This is the first report 
of Bacillus mycoides as a nitrogen-fixing rhizobacterium in sugarcane.
