OBJECTIVES: Crohn disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing condition possibly caused
by a dysbiotic microbiome. Approximately 30% to 60% of patients with CD have
anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA), but any association with gut
microbiota is unexplored. We hypothesized that ASCA positivity would predict a
signature microbial status and clinical phenotype.
METHODS: Ileocolonic mucosal biopsies were obtained from children with CD
(n = 135), and controls without inflammatory bowel disease (n = 45). Comparison
was made between ASCA status, microbial diversity, and clinical characteristics.
RESULTS: ASCA was highly specific but poorly sensitive for the diagnosis of CD.
In patients with CD, ASCA positivity was associated with older age (≥10 years),
ileocolonic disease, and long-term risk of surgery. Microbial alpha and beta
diversity were similar in patients with CD with or without ASCA, but
significantly less when compared to noninflammatory bowel disease controls.
Microbial richness was similar across all 3 groups. Fourteen bacterial species
were associated with ASCA-positive patients with CD and 14 species with
ASCA-negative patients (P < 0.05). After using a false discovery rate correction 
Ruminococcus torques and bacterium Yersinia enterocolitica 61 remained
significantly associated with CD ASCA positivity (P = 0.0178), whereas
Enterobacter cloacae and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were significantly
associated with CD ASCA negativity (P = 0.0178 and 0.0342).
CONCLUSION: ASCA-positive and ASCA-negative patients with CD have significant
differences in gut microbiome composition, which could possibly be influencing
the phenotype of the disease.
