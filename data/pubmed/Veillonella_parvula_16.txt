Oral microbes are a contributing factor to hyperglycemia by inducing an increase 
in insulin resistance resulting in uncontrolled blood glucose levels. However,
the relationship between the distribution of oral flora and hyperglycemia is
still controversial. Combining the power of MALDI-Biotyper with anaerobic
bacterial culture, this study explores the correlation between anaerobic bacteria
in the oral cavity and blood glucose levels. The results demonstrated that
altered blood glucose levels contributed to a varied bacterial distribution in
the oral cavity. Specifically, Veillonella spp. and Prevotella spp. were
identified in a higher proportion in people with elevated blood glucose levels.
Six bacterial species identified in this study (Prevotella melaninogenica,
Campylobacter rectus, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus 
salivarius, and Veillonella parvula) not only demonstrated a positive association
with higher blood glucose levels, but also likely contribute to the development
of the condition. The data demonstrated MALDI-TOF MS to be a simpler, faster, and
more economical clinical identification tool that provides clarity and depth to
the research on blood glucose and oral microbiota.
