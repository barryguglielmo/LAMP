The quest for potent alternatives to the currently used antimicrobials is urged
by health professionals, considering the rapid rise in resistance to
preservatives and antibiotics among pathogens. The current study was initiated to
search for novel and effective bacteriocins from food microbes, preferably lactic
acid bacteria (LAB), for potential use as preservatives. Advances in
genome-guided mass spectrometry (MS) were implemented to expedite identifying and
elucidating the structure of the recovered antimicrobial agent. A LAB strain,
OSY-TC318, was isolated from a Turkish cheese, and the crude extract of the
cultured strain inhibited the growth of various pathogenic and spoilage bacteria 
such as Bacillus cereus, Clostridium sporogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria 
monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus.
The antimicrobial producer was identified as Lactobacillus paraplantarum using MS
biotyping and genomic analysis. Additionally, L. paraplantarum OSY-TC318 was
distinguished from closely related strains using comparative genomic analysis.
Based on in silico analysis, the genome of the new strain contained a complete
lantibiotic biosynthetic gene cluster, encoding a novel lantibiotic that was
designated as paraplantaricin TC318. The bioinformatic analysis of the gene
cluster led to the prediction of the biosynthetic pathway, amino acid sequence,
and theoretical molecular mass of paraplantaricin TC318. To verify the genomic
analysis predictions, paraplantaricin TC318 was purified from the producer
cellular crude extract using liquid chromatography, followed by structural
elucidation using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS analysis. This
genome-guided MS analysis revealed that the molecular mass of paraplantaricin
TC318 is 2,263.900 Da, its chemical formula is C106H133N27O22S4, and its primary 
sequence is F-K-S-W-S-L-C-T-F-G-C-G-H-T-G-S-F-N-S-F-C-C. This lantibiotic, which 
differs from mutacin 1140 at positions 9, 12, 13, and 20, is considered a new
member of the epidermin group in class I lantibiotics. In conclusion, the study
revealed a new L. paraplantarum strain producing a novel lantibiotic that is
potentially useful in food and medical applications.
