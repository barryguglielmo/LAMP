The study reports protective role of potential probiotic cultures against
infection by biofilm forming Cronobacter sakazakii in Caenorhabditis elegans
model system. Among the fifteen indigenous potential probiotics, the cell free
supernatant of Lactobacillus gastricus BTM7 possessed highest antimicrobial
action and biofilm inhibition against C. sakazakii. The competitive exclusion
assays revealed that preconditioning with probiotics resulted in increased mean
life span of the nematode to 12-13 days as compared to 5-6 days when the pathogen
was administered alone. Enhanced expression of the marker genes (pmk-1, daf-16
and skn-1) was observed during the administration of probiotic cultures. The
highest expression of pmk-1 (2.5 folds) was observed with administration of L.
gastricus BTM7. The principal component analysis on selected variables revealed
that L. gastricus BTM7 has the potential to limit the infection of C. sakazakii
in C. elegans and enhance the expression of key genes involved in extending life 
span of the worm.
