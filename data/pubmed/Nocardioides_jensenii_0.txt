A Gram-stain positive, asporogenous, aerobic, white -coloured bacterium,
designated 18JY15-6T, was isolated from soil from Jeju Island, Korea. Pairwise
analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain 18JY15-6T indicated high
similarity to Nocardioides phosphati DSM 104026T (97.4%), Marmoricola terrae KACC
17308T (96.7%) and Nocardioides jensenii KCTC 0074BPT (96.6%). Phylogenetic
analysis revealed that strain 18JY15-6T formed a distinct lineage within the
family Nocardioidaceae and is closely related to members of the genus
Nocardioides. Genome sequencing of strain 18JY15-6T revealed 3221 total genes,
including 3162 protein coding genes, 59 RNA and 31 pseudogenes. Growth was
observed at 18-37 °C (optimal 30 °C) in R2A medium at pH 7.0. The major cellular 
fatty acids of strain 18JY15-6T were identified as C16:0, C18:1ω9c, C18:0
10-methyl, tuberculostearic and C17:0. The fatty acid profile of strain 18JY15-6T
was more dissimilar when compared with M. terrae. The only respiratory quinone
present was found to be MK-8(H4). The major polar lipids are
diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and
phosphatidylcholine. The results of phylogenetic, biochemical and chemotaxonomic 
characterisation allow the differentiation of strain 18JY15-6T from N. phosphati 
WYH11-7T, M. terrae JOS5-1T and N. jensenii NBRC 14755T which supports the
conclusion that this strain represents a novel species of the genus Nocardioides,
for which we propose the name Nocardioides jejuensis sp. nov. The type strain of 
Nocardioides jejuensis is 18JY15-6T (= KCTC 49105T = JCM 33182T).
