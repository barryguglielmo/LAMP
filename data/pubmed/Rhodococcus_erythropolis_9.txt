Proteasomes are multi-subunit protease complexes found in all domains of life.
The maturation of the core particle (CP), which harbors the active sites,
involves dimerization of two half CPs (HPs) and an autocatalytic cleavage that
removes β propeptides. How these steps are regulated remains poorly understood.
Here, we used the Rhodococcus erythropolis CP to dissect this process in vitro.
Our data show that propeptides regulate the dimerization of HPs through flexible 
loops we identified. Furthermore, N-terminal truncations of the propeptides
accelerated HP dimerization and decelerated CP auto-activation. We identified
cooperativity in autocatalysis and found that the propeptide can be partially
cleaved by adjacent active sites, potentially aiding an otherwise strictly
autocatalytic mechanism. We propose that cross-processing during bacterial CP
maturation is the underlying mechanism leading to the observed cooperativity of
activation. Our work suggests that the bacterial β propeptide plays an unexpected
and complex role in regulating dimerization and autocatalytic activation.
