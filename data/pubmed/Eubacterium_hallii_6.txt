The population cycles of small rodents have puzzled biologists for centuries.
There is a growing recognition of the cascading effects of climate change on the 
population dynamics of rodents. However, the ultimate cause for the bottom-up
effects of precipitation is poorly understood, from a microbial perspective.
Here, we conducted a precipitation manipulation experiment in the field, and
three feeding trials with controlled diets in the laboratory. We found
precipitation supplementation facilitated the recovery of a perennial rhizomatous
grass (Leymus chinensis) species, which altered the diet composition and increase
the intake of fructose and fructooligosaccharides for Brandt's vole. Lab results 
showed that this nutrient shift was accompanied by the modulation of gut
microbiota composition and functional pathways (especially for the degradation or
biosynthesis of L-histidine). Particularly, the relative abundance of Eubacterium
hallii was consistently increased after feeding voles with more L. chinensis,
fructose or fructooligosaccharide. These modulations ultimately increased the
production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and boosted the growth of vole.
This study provides evidence that the precipitation pulses cascades through the
plant community to affect rodent gut microbiome. Our results highlight the
importance of considering host-microbiota interaction when investigating rodent
population responses to climate change.
