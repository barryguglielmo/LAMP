Mycobacterium abscessus subsp. massiliense (Mycma) belongs to the Mycobacterium
abscessus complex and is a rapidly growing non-tuberculous mycobacterium. The
chronic pulmonary, skin, and soft tissue infections that it causes may be
difficult to treat due to its intrinsic resistance to the commonly used
antimicrobial drugs, making it a serious world public health problem. Iron is an 
essential nutrient for the growth of microorganisms; nonetheless, it can be toxic
when in excess. Thus, bacteria require an iron homeostasis mechanism to succeed
in different environments. DNA-binding proteins from starved cells (Dps) are
miniferritins with the property to act as additional iron storage proteins but
also can bind to DNA, protecting it against hydroxyl radical. Annotation of the
Mycma genome revealed the gene mycma_03135 with 79% sequential identity when
compared to MSMEG_3242 gene from M. smegmatis mc2 155, which codifies for a known
Dps. Recombinant Dps from M. abscessus (rMaDps) was produced in Escherichia coli,
purified in soluble form and shown to form high mass oligomers in solution with
ferroxidase activity, DNA binding, and protection against damage. The expression 
of the mycma_03135 gene was induced during Mycma growth in the presence of
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Additionally, the expression of rMaDps by E. coli
conferred greater resistance to H2O2. Thus, this study is the first to identify
and characterize a Dps from M. abscessus. KEY POINTS: Mycobacterium abscessus
subsp. massiliense express a miniferritin protein (Dps). Mycma Dps binds to DNA
and protects against oxidative stress.
