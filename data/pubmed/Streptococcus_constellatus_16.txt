Descending necrotizing mediastinitis is a severe infection of the mediastinum.
This syndrome manifests as fever and chest pain following cough and sputum
production. A 49-year-old woman presented with fever and a 14-day history of
pneumonia. CT showed mediastinal abscesses with a giant calcified mediastinal
lymph node (21 × 18 mm) and pneumonia. Bronchoscopy by EBUS-TBNA under general
anesthesia was performed. The pathogen found in the puncture culture was
Streptococcus constellatus, and antibiotics (mezlocillin/sulbactam 3.375 IVGTT
q8h) was administered. A proximal right main bronchial neoplasm, suspected lung
cancer, was found and conformed to inflammatory granuloma. A total of 22 months
post-discharge the patient was clinically stable. We also conducted a review of
the literature for all Streptococcus constellatus descending necrotizing
mediastinitis infections between 2011 and 2017.
