BACKGROUND: Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are widely used to diagnose 
tuberculosis (TB), but cannot discriminate live bacilli from dead bacilli. Live
bacilli can be isolated by culture methods, but this is time-consuming. We
developed a de novo TB diagnostic method that detects only live bacilli with high
sensitivity within hours.
METHODS: A prospective study was performed in Taiwan from 2017 to 2018. Sputum
was collected consecutively from 1102 patients with suspected TB infection. The
sputum was pretreated and heated at 46°C for 1 h to induce the secretion of MPT64
protein from live Mycobacterium tuberculosis. MPT64 was detected with our
ultrasensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) coupled with
thionicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (thio-NAD) cycling. We compared our data
with those obtained using a culture test (MGIT), a smear test (Kinyoun staining),
and a NAAT (Xpert).
FINDINGS: The limit of detection for MPT64 in our culture-free ultrasensitive
ELISA was 2.0 × 10-19 moles/assay. When the criterion for a positive response was
set as an absorbance value ≥17 mAbs, this value corresponded to ca. 330 CFU/mL in
the culture method - almost the same high-detection sensitivity as the culture
method. To confirm that MPT64 is secreted from only live bacilli, M. bovis BCG
was killed using 8 μg/mL rifampicin and then heated. Following this procedure,
our method detected no MPT64. Our rapid ultra-sensitive ELISA-based method
required only 5 h to complete. Comparing the results of our method with those of 
culture tests for 944 specimens revealed a sensitivity of 86.9% (93/107, 95% CI: 
79.0-92.7%) and a specificity of 92.0% (770/837, 95% CI: 89.9-93.7%). The
performance data were not significantly different (McNemar's test, P = 0.887)
from those of the Xpert tests. In addition, at a ≥1+ titer in the smear test, the
positive predictive value of our culture-free ultrasensitive ELISA tests was in a
good agreement with that of the culture tests. Furthermore, our culture-free
ultrasensitive ELISA test had better validity for drug effectiveness examination 
than Xpert tests because our test detected only live bacilli.
INTERPRETATION: Our culture-free ultrasensitive ELISA method detects only live TB
bacilli with high sensitivity within hours, allowing for rapid diagnosis of TB
and monitoring drug efficacy.
