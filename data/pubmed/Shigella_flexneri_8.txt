Shigella flexneri targets colonic cells in humans to initiate invasive infection 
processes that lead to dysentery, and direct interactions between their
lipopolysaccharide O antigens and blood group A related glycans are involved in
the cell adherence interactions. Here, we show that treatment with Tn and
sialyl-Tn glycans, monoclonal antibodies and lectins reactive to Tn/sialyl-Tn,
and luteolin (a Tn antigen synthesis inhibitor) all significantly inhibited
S. flexneri adherence and invasion of cells in vitro. Surface plasmon resonance
analysis showed that lipopolysaccharide O antigen had a high affinity interaction
with Tn/sialyl-Tn. Immunofluorescence probing of human colon tissue with
antibodies detected expression of Tn/sialyl-Tn by MUC2 producing goblet cells
(GCs), and S. flexneri incubated with human colon tissue colocalized with GCs.
Our findings demonstrate that S. flexneri targets GCs in the human colonic crypts
via glycan-glycan interactions, establishing new insight into the infection
process in humans.
