BACKGROUND: Some of the spore-forming strains of Bacillus probiotics are marketed
commercially as they survive harsh gastrointestinal conditions and bestow health 
benefits to the host.
RESULTS: We report the composite genome of Bacillus clausii ENTPro from a
commercially available probiotic Enterogermina® and compare it with the genomes
of other Bacillus probiotics. We find that the members of B. clausii species
harbor high heterogeneity at the species as well as genus level. The genes
conferring resistance to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, rifampicin, and
tetracycline in the B. clausii ENTPro strain could be identified. The genes
coding for the bacteriocin gallidermin, which prevents biofilm formation in the
pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis, were also identified. KEGG
Pathway analysis suggested that the folate biosynthesis pathway, which depicts
one of the important roles of probiotics in the host, is conserved completely in 
B. subtilis and minimally in B. clausii and other probiotics.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified various antibiotic resistance, bacteriocins,
stress-related, and adhesion-related domains, and industrially-relevant pathways,
in the genomes of these probiotic bacteria that are likely to help them survive
in the harsh gastrointestinal tract, facilitating adhesion to host epithelial
cells, persistence during antibiotic treatment and combating bacterial
infections.
