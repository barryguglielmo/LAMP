BACKGROUND: Whipple's disease is a clinically relevant multi-system disorder that
is often undiagnosed given its elusive nature. We present an atypical case of
Whipple's disease involving pan-valvular endocarditis and constrictive
pericarditis, requiring cardiac intervention. A literature review was also
performed assessing the prevalence of atypical cases of Whipple's disease.
CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 56-year-old male presented with a
four-year history of congestive heart failure with weight loss and fatigue.
Notably, he had absent gastrointestinal symptoms. He went on to develop
pan-valvular endocarditis and constrictive pericarditis requiring urgent cardiac 
surgery. A clinical diagnosis of Whipple's disease was suspected, prompting
duodenal biopsy sampling which was unremarkable, Subsequently, Tropheryma
whipplei was identified by 16S rDNA PCR on the cardiac valvular tissue. He
underwent prolonged antibiotic therapy with recovery of symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study reports the first known case of Whipple's disease
involving pan-valvular endocarditis and constrictive pericarditis. A literature
review also highlights this presentation of atypical Whipple's with limited
gastrointestinal manifestations. Duodenal involvement was limited and the gold
standard of biopsy was not contributory. We also highlight the Canadian
epidemiology of the disease from 2012 to 2016 with an approximate 4% prevalence
rate amongst submitted samples. Routine investigations for Whipple's disease,
including duodenal biopsy, in this case may have missed the diagnosis. A high
degree of suspicion was critical for diagnosis of unusual manifestations of
Whipple's disease.
