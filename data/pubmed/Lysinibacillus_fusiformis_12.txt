Bacterial surface layer proteins (S-layer) possess unique binding properties for 
metal ions. By combining the binding capability of S-layer proteins with the
optical properties of gold nanoparticles (AuNP), namely plasmonic resonance, a
colorimetric detection system for metal and metalloid ions in water was
developed. Eight S-layer proteins from different bacteria species were used for
the functionalization of AuNP. The thus developed biohybrid systems, AuNP
functionalized with S-layer proteins, were tested with different metal salt
solutions, e.g. Indium(III)-chloride, Yttrium(III)-chloride or
Nickel(II)-chloride, to determine their selective and sensitive binding to ionic 
analytes. All tested S-layer proteins displayed unique binding affinities for the
different metal ions. For each S-layer and metal ion combination markedly
different reaction patterns and differences in concentration range and absorption
spectra were detected by UV/vis spectroscopy. In this way, the selective
detection of tested metal ions was achieved by differentiated analysis of a
colorimetric screening assay of these biohybrid systems. A highly selective and
sensitive detection of yttrium ions down to a concentration of 1.67 × 10-5 mol/l 
was achieved with S-layer protein SslA functionalized AuNP. The presented
biohybrid systems can thus be used as a sensitive and fast sensor system for
metal and metalloid ions in aqueous systems.
