Coniochaeta species are versatile ascomycetes that have great capacity to
deconstruct lignocellulose. Here, we explore the transcriptome of Coniochaeta sp.
strain 2T2.1 from wheat straw-driven cultures with the fungus growing alone or as
a member of a synthetic microbial consortium with Sphingobacterium multivorum w15
and Citrobacter freundii so4. The differential expression profiles of
carbohydrate-active enzymes indicated an onset of (hemi)cellulose degradation by 
2T2.1 during the initial 24 hours of incubation. Within the tripartite
consortium, 63 transcripts of strain 2T2.1 were differentially expressed at this 
time point. The presence of the two bacteria significantly upregulated the
expression of one galactose oxidase, one GH79-like enzyme, one multidrug
transporter, one laccase-like protein (AA1 family) and two bilirubin oxidases,
suggesting that inter-kingdom interactions (e.g. amensalism) take place within
this microbial consortium. Overexpression of multicopper oxidases indicated that 
strain 2T2.1 may be involved in lignin depolymerization (a trait of enzymatic
synergism), while S. multivorum and C. freundii have the metabolic potential to
deconstruct arabinoxylan. Under the conditions applied, 2T2.1 appears to be a
better degrader of wheat straw when the two bacteria are absent. This conclusion 
is supported by the observed suppression of its (hemi)cellulolytic arsenal and
lower degradation percentages within the microbial consortium.
