Bacillus firmus I-1582 is approved in Europe for the management of Meloidogyne on
vegetable crops. However, little information about its modes of action and
temperature requirements is available, despite the effect of these parameters in 
its efficacy. The cardinal temperatures for bacterial growth and biofilm
formation were determined. The bacteria was transformed with GFP to study its
effect on nematode eggs and root colonization of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum)
and cucumber (Cucumis sativus) by laser-scanning confocal microscopy. Induction
of plant resistance was determined in split-root experiments and the dynamic
regulation of genes related to jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) by
RT-qPCR at three different times after nematode inoculation. The bacteria was
able to grow and form biofilms between 15 and 45°C; it degraded egg-shells and
colonized eggs; it colonized tomato roots more extensively than cucumber roots;
it induced systemic resistance in tomato, but not in cucumber; SA and JA related 
genes were primed at different times after nematode inoculation in tomato, but
only the SA-related gene was up-regulated at 7 days after nematode inoculation in
cucumber. In conclusion, B. firmus I-1582 is active at a wide range of
temperatures; its optimal growth temperature is 35°C; it is able to degrade
Meloidogyne eggs, and to colonize plant roots, inducing systemic resistance in a 
plant dependent species manner.
