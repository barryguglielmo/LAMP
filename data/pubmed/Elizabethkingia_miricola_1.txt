The Elizabethkingia genus has gained global attention in recent years as
containing sporadic, worldwide, nosocomial pathogens. Elizabethkingia spp. are
intrinsically multidrug resistant, primarily infect immunocompromised
individuals, and are associated with high mortality (∼20 to 40%). As yet, gaps
remain in our understanding of transmission, global strain relatedness,
antimicrobial resistance, and effective therapy. Over a 16-year period, 22
clinical and 6 hospital environmental isolates were collected from Queensland,
Australia. Identification using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time 
of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (Vitek MS) and whole-genome sequencing
was compared with a global strain data set. Phylogenomic reconstruction robustly 
identified 22 Elizabethkingia anophelis, 3 Elizabethkingia miricola, 2
Elizabethkingia meningoseptica, and 1 Elizabethkingia bruuniana isolates, most of
which branched as unique lineages. Global analysis revealed that some Australian 
E. anophelis isolates are genetically closely related to strains from the United 
States, England, and Asia. Comparative genomics of clinical and environmental
strains identified evidence of nosocomial transmission in patients, indicating
probable infection from a hospital reservoir. Furthermore, broth microdilution
against 39 antimicrobials revealed almost ubiquitous resistance to
aminoglycosides, carbapenems, cephalosporins, and penicillins. Like other
international strains, our isolates expressed susceptibility to minocycline and
levofloxacin and the less common trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Our study
demonstrates important new insights into the genetic diversity, environmental
persistence, and transmission of and potential effective therapy for Australian
Elizabethkingia species.
