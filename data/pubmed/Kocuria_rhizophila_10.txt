An endophytic actinomycete strain SKH1-2 isolated from Musa (ABB) cv. 'Kluai Sao 
Kratuep Ho' collected in Suphan Buri province (14° 54' 22.5″ N/100° 04' 50″ E),
Thailand, was identified as Streptomyces pseudovenezuelae based on phenotypic and
chemotaxonomic characteristics, and 16S rRNA sequence analyses. A chemical
investigation led to the isolation of two polyketide molecules from the n-butanol
crude extract of the strain SKH1-2 culture broth. The compounds were purified
using various chromatographic techniques and identified using spectroscopic
methods compared with earlier published data. Compound 1, chartreusin, is known
as an anti-Gram (+) bacterial compound and was active against Bacillus subtilis
ATCC 6633, Kocuria rhizophila ATCC 9341 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538p with
MIC values of 3.1, 1.6 and 12.5 μg/mL, respectively. Compound 2, lumichrome, did 
not show activity against all tested microbes. To our knowledge, this is the
first report of chartreusin and lumichrome isolated from S. pseudovenezuelae.
Taken together, it could be proved that Thai plant species are valuable
reservoirs of interesting endophytic actinomycetes producing several interesting 
biologically active compounds.
