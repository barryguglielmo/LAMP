BACKGROUND: Papua New Guinea (PNG) has among the highest prevalence of sexually
transmitted infections in the world but no estimates of Chlamydia trachomatis,
Neisseria gonorrhoeae, or hepatitis B virus (HBV) are available among men who
have sex with men (MSM) or transgender women (TGW).
METHODS: We conducted respondent-driven sampling surveys among MSM and TGW in
Port Moresby, Lae, and Mt. Hagen (2016-2017) to characterize prevalence of these 
infections. Eligibility criteria: aged>12 years, born male, could speak English
or Tok Pisin and had oral or anal sex with another person born male in the past 6
months. Participants were surveyed face-to-face and offered testing for anorectal
and genital chlamydia and gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV, and HBV. All results are
RDS-weighted.
RESULTS: We enrolled 400 participants in Port Moresby, 352 in Lae, and 111 in Mt.
Hagen. Chlamydia prevalence in the three cities regardless of anatomical site was
19.9%, 19.2%, and 24.3%, respectively. Gonorrhea prevalence regardless of
anatomical site was 10.3%, 9.4%, and 9.6%, respectively. HBV prevalence was
11.7%, 13.8%, and 13.6%, respectively. In multivariable analysis, syphilis was
associated with having either chlamydia or gonorrhea in Port Moresby (adjusted
odds ratio [aOR]: 4.0, 95% CI: 2.0-7.9) and Lae (aOR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.2-5.0).
CONCLUSIONS: There is a large unmet need among MSM and TGW in PNG for chlamydia
and gonorrhea detection and treatment. The high prevalence of HBV reinforces the 
importance of ensuring introduction and scale up of HBV treatment and
immunization. Urgent efforts are needed to introduce laboratory-based diagnosis
for chlamydia and gonorrhea to ensure these populations have access to much
needed treatment services.
