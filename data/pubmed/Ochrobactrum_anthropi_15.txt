The aim of this work was to compare production of endotoxin and to determine
susceptibility to antibiotics in two groups of specimens-wild-type strains
Ochrobactrum anthropi isolated from the environment and the strains isolated from
patients with cystic fibrosis. The determination of the endotoxin produced by the
test strains was carried on by using a limulus amebocyte lysate test (LAL test). 
Determination of ATB sensitivity was accomplished by means of a broth dilution
method in a microtiter plate (MIC). No significant difference was found between
the group of ochrobacters isolated from the environment and the group of
ochrobacters isolated from cystic fibrosis patients. Antibiotic sensitivity
testing has indicated that the resistance to tigecycline,
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and gentamicin was slightly higher in strains
isolated from cystic fibrosis patients in comparison with strains isolated from
the environment. In general, most of the test strains were sensitive to most of
the antibiotics tested. Significant resistance has been demonstrated for
cefotaxime. Resistance was also found for gentamicin in strains number 4 and 7.
The MIC was equal to the breakpoint for this antibiotic (8000 mg/L).
