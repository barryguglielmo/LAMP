In present study, a potential bacterial isolate Acetobacter pasteurianus SKYAA25 
was found to be very effective in the bioconversion of apple pomace to acetic
acid. The isolated strain was tolerant to high ethanol concentrations of upto 14%
and temperature of 42 °C. Fermentation of apple pomace alone in presence of
brewing yeast produced 7.3% of bio-ethanol which was further used for acetic acid
production. Apple pomace in combination with cane molasses produced 14% of
bio-ethanol. The fermented bio-ethanol was used as medium for acetic acid
production which yielded 52.4 g of acetic acid/100 g of DM (Dry Matter) of apple 
pomace. Hence, an ecofriendly process has been developed that is entirely based
on microbial processing of apple pomace to produce acetic acid without involving 
commercial enzymes. The present bio-conversion will prove to be beneficial for
utilizing food and beverage industrial waste in the production of acetic acid.
