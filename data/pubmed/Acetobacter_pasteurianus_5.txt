Shake-flask cultures of microorganisms involve flame sterilization during
sampling, which produces combustion gas with high CO2 concentrations. The gaseous
destination has not been deeply analyzed. Our aim was to investigate the effect
of flame sterilization on the headspace of the flask and on the shake-flask
culture. In this study, the headspace CO2 concentration was found to increase
during flame sterilization ~0.5-2.0% over 5-20â€‰s empirically using the
Circulation Direct Monitoring and Sampling System. This CO2 accumulation was
confirmed theoretically using Computational Fluid Dynamics; it was 9% topically. 
To evaluate the influence of CO2 accumulation without interference from other
sampling factors, the flask gas phase formed by flame sterilization was
reproduced by aseptically supplying 99.8% CO2 into the headspace, without
sampling. We developed a unit that can be sampled in situ without interruption of
shaking, movement to a clean bench, opening of the culture-plug, and flame
sterilization. We observed that the growth behaviour of Escherichia coli,
Pelomonas saccharophila, Acetobacter pasteurianus, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae
was different depending on the CO2 aeration conditions. These results are
expected to contribute to improving microbial cell culture systems.
