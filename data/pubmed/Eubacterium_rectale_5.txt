BACKGROUND: Psychological co-morbidities in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have
been widely recognized, whereas less is known regarding the role of gut microbial
and host metabolic changes in clinical and psychological symptoms in IBS.
RESULTS: A total of 70 diarrhoea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) patients and 46 healthy 
controls were enrolled in this study. Stool and urine samples were collected from
both groups for 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomic analysis. The results
showed that fecal microbiota in IBS-D featured depleted Faecalibacterium
(adjusted P = 0.034), Eubacterium rectale group (adjusted P = 0.048),
Subdoligranulum (adjusted P = 0.041) and increased Prevotella (adjusted
P = 0.041). O-ureido-L-serine, 3,4-dihydroxybenzenesulfonic acid and
(R)-2-Hydroxyglutarate demonstrated lower urinary concentrations in IBS-D
patients. We further built correlation matrices between gut microbe abundance,
differentiated metabolite quantities and clinical parameters. Dialister
manifested negative association with IBS severity (r = - 0.285, P = 0.017),
anxiety (r = - 0.347, P = 0.003) and depression level (r = - 0.308, P = 0.010).
Roseburia was negatively associated with IBS severity (r = - 0.298, P = 0.012).
Twenty metabolites correlated with anxiety or depression levels, including
3,4-dihydroxymandelaldehyde with SAS (r = - 0.383, P = 0.001), 1-methylxanthine
with SDS (r = - 0.347, P = 0.004) and 1D-chiro-inositol with SAS (r = - 0.336,
P = 0.005). In analysis of microbe-metabolite relationship,
3,4-dihydroxymandelaldehyde and 1-methylxanthine were negatively correlated with 
relative abundance of Clostridiumsensu stricto.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated altered microbial and metabolomic profiles
associated with clinically and psychological symptoms in IBS-D patients, which
may provide insights for further investigations.
