Ocular tuberculosis (OTB) encompasses all forms of intra- and extra-ocular
inflammation associated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. However,
the organism is rarely found in ocular fluid samples of diseased eyes, rendering 
the pathomechanisms of the disease unclear. This confounds clinical
decision-making in diagnosis and treatment of OTB. Here, we critically review
existing human and animal data related to ocular inflammation and TB pathogenesis
to unravel likely pathomechanisms of OTB. Broadly there appear to be two
fundamental mechanisms that may underlie the development of TB-associated ocular 
inflammation: a. inflammatory response to live/replicating Mtb in the eye, and b.
immune mediated ocular inflammation induced by non-viable Mtb or its components
in the eye. This distinction is significant as in direct Mtb-driven mechanisms,
diagnosis and treatment would be aimed at detection of Mtb-infection and its
elimination; while indirect mechanisms would primarily require anti-inflammatory 
therapy with adjunctive anti-TB therapy. Further, we discuss how that most
clinical phenotypes of OTB likely represent a combination of both mechanisms,
with one being predominant than the other.
