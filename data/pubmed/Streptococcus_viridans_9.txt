The aim of this study was to evaluate the Streptococcus mutans biofilm influence 
on the roughness (Ra), gloss (GU), surface hardness (KHN) and flexural strength
(FS) of high viscosity bulk fill composites. Filtek Bulk Fill (FBF), Tetric N
Ceram Bulk Fill (TNC), X-tra fil Bulk Fill (XF) and Filtek Z350 (FZ) were used.
Ten discs of each composite were prepared for Ra, KHN and GU and 20 bars for the 
FS. After 24 h, specimens were polished and initial analyzes performed. Samples
were sterilized and subjected to biodegradation for 7 days and final analyzes
performed. Representative samples of each group were evaluated in Scanning
Electron Microscope. Data were submitted to ANOVA two factors and Tukey test. XF 
presented the highest values (p<0.05) of Ra before and after biodegradation
(0.1251; 0.3100), and FZ (0.1443) the lowest after biodegradation (p<0.05). The
highest GU values (p<0.05) were observed for FZ (71.7; 62) and FBF (69.0; 64.6), 
and the lowest (p<0.05) for TNC (61.4; 53.3) and XF (58.5; 53.5), both before and
after biodegradation. For KHN the highest values were obtained by XF (151.7;
106), and the (p< 0.05) lowest values for TNC (62.2; 51.8), both before and after
biodegradation. The highest values (p<0.05) of FS were observed for FZ (127.6)
and the lowest (p<0.05) for TNC (86.9); after biodegradation, XF (117.7)
presented the highest (p<0.05) values compared to TNC and FZ." In conclusion,
biodegradation increased Ra and decreased GU and KHN for all. Concerning FS,
degradation provided a significant decreased value only for FZ.
