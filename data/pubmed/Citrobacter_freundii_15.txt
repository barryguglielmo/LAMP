OBJECTIVES: To investigate a persistent multispecies OXA-204 outbreak occurring
simultaneously in multiple distant hospitals in the province of Quebec, Canada.
METHODS: OXA-204 carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) isolated from
multiple hospitals between January 2016 and October 2018 were included in the
study. An epidemiological inquiry was conducted in order to elucidate possible
transmission routes and a putative source. Isolates were characterized by
standardized antibiotic susceptibility testing and by WGS, using Illumina
short-read data and MinION long-read data.
RESULTS: The outbreak comprised 65 patients and 82 isolates from four hospital
sites. Most patients were ≥65 years old, had multiple comorbidities and had
received antibiotics recently. The infection to colonization ratio was 1:20. No
persistent environmental reservoir was identified. The most frequent organism was
Citrobacter freundii (n = 78), followed by Klebsiella spp. (n = 3) and
Escherichia coli (n = 1). WGS analysis showed 77/78 C. freundii isolates
differing by 0-26 single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Results of WGS analysis
showed blaOXA-204 was present on three plasmids types (IncX1, IncA/C2 and
IncFII/FIB/A/C2) and on a prophage. All C. freundii isolates harboured multiple
copies of blaOXA-204, both on the chromosome and a plasmid. Plasmid
IncFII/FIB/A/C2 was observed in all three species.
CONCLUSIONS: Transfer of OXA-204 plasmids likely occurred between species within 
the same patient, highlighting the plasticity of these plasmids and potential for
widespread dissemination. OXA-204 carbapenemase has been introduced into Quebec
and has rapidly disseminated. Although the infection to colonization ratio was
low in this outbreak, this carbapenemase has been associated with severe
infection elsewhere.
