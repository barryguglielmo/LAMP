OBJECTIVE: Gut dysbiosis has been reported implicated in ankylosing spondylitis
(AS), a common chronic inflammatory disease mainly affects sacroiliac joints and 
spine. Utilizing deep sequencing on the feces of untreated AS patients, our study
aimed at providing an in-depth understanding of AS gut microbiota.
METHODS: We analyzed the fecal metagenome of 85 untreated AS patients and 62
healthy controls by metagenomic shotgun sequencing, and 23 post-treatment feces
of those AS patients were collected for comparison. Comparative analyses among
different cohorts including AS, rheumatoid arthritis and Behcet's disease were
performed to uncover some common signatures related to inflammatory arthritis.
Molecular mimicry of a microbial peptide was also demonstrated by ELISpot assay.
RESULTS: We identified AS-enriched species including Bacteroides coprophilus,
Parabacteroides distasonis, Eubacterium siraeum, Acidaminococcus fermentans and
Prevotella copri. Pathway analysis revealed increased oxidative phosphorylation, 
lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and glycosaminoglycan degradation in AS gut
microbiota. Microbial signatures of AS gut selected by random forest model showed
high distinguishing accuracy. Some common signatures related to autoimmunity,
such as Bacteroides fragilis and type III secretion system (T3SS), were also
found. Finally, in vitro experiments demonstrated an increased amount of IFN-γ
producing cells triggered by a bacterial peptide of AS-enriched species,
mimicking type II collagen.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings collectively indicate that gut microbiota was
perturbed in untreated AS patients with diagnostic potential, and some
AS-enriched species might be triggers of autoimmunity by molecular mimicry.
Additionally, different inflammatory arthritis shared some common microbial
signatures.
