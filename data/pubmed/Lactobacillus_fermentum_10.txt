The gut microbiota has pivotal roles in metabolic homeostasis and modulation of
the intestinal environment. Notably, the administration of Lactobacillus spp.
ameliorates diet-induced obesity in humans and mice. However, the mechanisms
through which Lactobacillus spp. control host metabolic homeostasis remain
unclear. Accordingly, in this study, we evaluated the physiological roles of
Lactobacillus fermentum in controlling metabolic homeostasis in diet-induced
obesity. Our results demonstrated that L. fermentum-potentiated oxidative
phosphorylation in adipose tissue, resulting in increased energy expenditure to
protect against diet-induced obesity. Indeed, oral administration of L. fermentum
LM1016 markedly ameliorated glucose clearance and fatty liver in high-fat
diet-fed mice. Moreover, administration of L. fermentum LM1016 markedly decreased
inflammation and increased oxidative phosphorylation in gonadal white adipose
tissue, as demonstrated by transcriptome analysis. Finally, metabolome analysis
showed that metabolites derived from L. fermentum LM1016-attenuated adipocyte
differentiation and inflammation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. These pronounced
metabolic improvements suggested that the application of L. fermentum LM1016
could have clinical applications for the treatment of metabolic syndromes, such
as diet-induced obesity.
