The environmental distribution of the neurotoxic amino acid,
3-N-methyl-2,3-diaminopropanoic acid (BMAA), first isolated in 1967, was
initially believed to be limited to tropical and subtropical plants of the genus 
Cycas. The seeds of one such species, which had been used historically on the
Pacific island of Guam as a foodstuff, had a reputation for neurotoxicity. Some
40 years later the amino acid was detected in terrestrial and aquatic
cyanobacteria and in other aquatic organisms. Overlooked was the discovery of
BMAA in peptides of bizarre structure that had been isolated in 1975 from
Paenibacillus pulvifaciens during a search for antibiotics. More recently (2014),
peptides of similar structure were isolated from Paenibacillus larvae; this
organism is causative of American Foulbrood, a lethal disease of honeybee
colonies. These are interesting chemical and environmental observations, but
knowledge of the bacterial distribution of BMAA is limited to just these two
species of Paenibacillus, while more than 200 Paenibacillus spp. are known.
Paenibacillus spp. are ever present naturally in the environment and are used
agriculturally; recent research reports that some species infect human foods -
including cow's milk - and have been isolated from human body fluids. We wish to 
stimulate interest in the environmental distribution of the neurotoxic BMAA in
Paenibacillus spp. by drawing together previously isolated streams of research
and by proposing experimental approaches by which this matter might be resolved.
