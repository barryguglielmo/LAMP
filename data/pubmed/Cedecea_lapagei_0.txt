A 45-year-old man presented with acute sinusitis. He was treated with a 10-day
course of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and a subsequent 14-day course of
amoxicillin-clavulanate with no improvement in symptoms. Culture of purulent
nasal secretions revealed the rare enterobacter Cedecea lapagei The patient had
complete resolution of his symptoms after a 14-day course of
gentamicin/dexamethasone nasal rinses. Emerging pathogens have been a timeless
concern for physicians, as witnessed by the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. C.
lapagei has been reported to cause human infection only a dozen times since its
discovery, all in severely compromised patients. This is the first documented
case of sinusitis reported with C. lapagei and may portend a rising prevalence of
disease burden in the general population. This case demonstrates the necessity of
obtaining cultures when standard antibiotics result in treatment failure.
