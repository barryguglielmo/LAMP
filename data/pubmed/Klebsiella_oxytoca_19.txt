The prevalence of carbapenem resistance among bacterial isolates from selected
water bodies receiving hospital effluents and adjoining aquaculture farms in
Kerala, India, was studied. Klebsiella pneumoniae followed by Escherichia coli,
Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes and Acinetobacter baumannii were the
predominant isolates. Antibiotic sensitivity of these isolates was determined by 
Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Nearly 60% of the Enterobacteriaceae isolates 
screened were multidrug resistant of which 16.6% were carbapenem resistant. The
carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were further screened for the presence of
New Delhi metallo β-lactamase-1 and cephalosporin resistance encoding genes. All 
NDM-1 isolates were highly resistant to carbapenem, cephalosporin,
aminoglycosides, quinolones, tetracycline, and sulphonamides. K. pneumoniae
harboring blaNDM-1 gene and E. coli isolates with blaCTX-M-15 and blaSHV-11 genes
were detected in hospital discharge points. In aquaculture farms too,
carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae with blaNDM-1 gene and E. coli isolates with
blaCTX-M-15 were observed, although there was no use of antibiotics in these
farms. However, other carbapenemase genes such as blaTEM, blaVIM, blaIMP and
blaGIM were not detected in any of these isolates. The results suggest the
increased prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in the water
bodies receiving hospital effluent and its dissemination to adjacent aquaculture 
farms, posing a serious threat to public health.
