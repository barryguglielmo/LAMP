INTRODUCTION: Chryseobacterium arthrosphaerae is a gram-negative bacteria, known 
for its intrinsic multidrug resistance, which can lead to treatment difficulties.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 56-year-old male had an indwelling external ventricular
drainage catheter for 6 months and had been frequently treated with antibiotics
for nosocomial infections. He showed cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis and an
abrupt fever during hospitalization.
DIAGNOSIS: He was diagnosed as a ventriculitis caused by Chryseobacterium
arthrosphaerae (C arthrosphaerae).
INTERVENTION: Initially, we used ciprofloxacin as the backbone in combination
with minocycline (and rifampin). However, fever and pleocytosis persisted, and
improvement was slow. We then switched the minocycline and rifampin regiment to
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Following this switch of antibiotics, the
patient's pleocytosis rapidly improved, allowing the replacement of his external 
ventricular drainage catheters. C arthrospharae was no longer growing in
cerebrospinal fluid and he was recovered from ventriculitis.
OUTCOMES: The patient remains alive without any incidence of C arthrosphaerae
recurrence.
CONCLUSION: We propose trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole alone or in combination with
ciprofloxacin to be good candidates for the treatment of ventriculitis by C
arthrosphaerae.
