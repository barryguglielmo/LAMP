PURPOSE: To compare the effectiveness of topical fluoride-antibacterial agent
combined therapy versus topical fluoride monotherapy in preventing dental caries 
among 1- to 16-year-old children.
METHODS: PubMed, EbscoHost, Scopus, Web of Science and the Cochrane Central
Register of Controlled Trials were searched for randomised controlled trials. The
trials should have assessed the caries-preventive effectiveness of topical
fluoride-antibacterial agent (Povidone
Iodine/Chlorhexidine/Xylitol/Triclosan/Cetylpyridinium Chloride) combined therapy
versus topical fluoride monotherapy among children. Out of 3475 records that were
screened, full text of 41 articles was assessed for potential inclusion. Sixteen 
trials that fulfilled the eligibility criteria were subjected to qualitative
synthesis. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool.
Continuous data from nine trials were pooled using Inverse Variance test in
meta-analysis function of Review Manager (version 5.4). GRADE approach was used
to analyse the certainty of evidence. Statistical heterogeneity was quantified
using the I2 statistic. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered as statistically
significant.
RESULTS: With respect to the caries increment, combined therapy showed superior
caries-preventive effectiveness than topical fluoride monotherapy [SMD - 0.12,
95% CI (- 0.2 to - 0.04), p = 0.004; (I2 = 20%, p = 0.29)]. No significant
difference was noted between the two groups for the post-intervention salivary S 
mutans count [SMD - 0.11, 95% CI (- 0.33 to 0.1), p = 0.3; (I2 = 0%, p = 0.77)].
CONCLUSION: The pooled analysis indicates towards an added benefit of topical
fluoride-antibacterial agent combined therapy over topical fluoride monotherapy
in preventing dental caries incidence among children. However, the results may be
interpreted with caution since the evidence generated is of low certainty and is 
driven by two studies on Xylitol, thus it demands further good quality trials.
