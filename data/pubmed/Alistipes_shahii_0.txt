Several studies based on 16SrDNA analysis have revealed certain unique
characteristics of gut microbiome in centenarians. We established a prospective
cohort of fecal microbiota and conducted the first metagenomics-based study among
centenarians. The objective was to explore the dynamic changes of gut microbiota 
in healthy centenarians and centenarians approaching end of life and to unravel
the characteristics of aging-associated microbiome. Seventy-five healthy
centenarians residing in three regions of Hainan participated in follow-up
surveys and collection of fecal samples at intervals of 3 months. Data pertaining
to dietary status, health status scores, cause of disease and death, and fecal
specimens were collected for 15 months. Twenty participants died within 20 months
during the follow-up period. The median survival time was 8-9 months (range,
1-17) and the mortality rate was 14.7% per year. The health status scores before 
death were significantly lower than those at 3 months before the end of the
follow-up period [median score: 3 (range, 1-5), P < 0.05]. At this time, the
participants mainly exhibited symptoms of anorexia and reduced dietary intake and
physical activity. Metagenomics sequencing and analysis were carried out to
characterize the gut microbiota changes in the centenarians during their
transition from healthy status to death. Anosim analysis showed a significant
change in gut microbiota from 7 months prior to death (R = 0.10, P = 0.02). All
participants were grouped with 7 months before death as cut-off; no significant
difference in α diversity was found between the two groups (P = 0.45).
Semi-supervised monitoring and log rank sum analysis revealed significant changes
in the abundance of ten bacterial species before death; of these, eight species
were significantly reduced (Akkermansia muciniphila, Alistipes finegoldii,
Alistipes shahii, Bacteroides faecis, Bacteroides intestinalis, Butyrivibrio
crossotus, Bacteroides stercoris, and Prevotella stercorea) while two were
significantly increased before death (Bifidobacterium longum and Ruminococcus
bromii). Compared to centenarians in northern Italy, Hainan centenarians
exhibited unique characteristics of gut microbiome. The abundance of ten
bacterial species showed significant changes starting from 7 months before death.
We speculate that these changes might occur before the clinical symptoms of
deterioration in health status.
