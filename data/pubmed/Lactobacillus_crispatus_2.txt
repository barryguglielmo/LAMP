Vaginal samples from women with term deliveries were tested for torquetenovirus
(TTV) by gene amplification, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8 and D- and L-lactic
acid by ELISA, and microbiome composition by analysis of the bacterial 16S
ribosomal RNA gene. TTV was detected in 43.2%, 31.5%, and 41.4% of first
trimester, third trimester, and postpartum samples, respectively. The viral titer
was higher in postpartum than in the first (p = 0.0018) or third (p = 0.0013)
trimester. The mean gestational age at delivery was lower in women positive for
TTV in their first trimester (p = 0.0358). In the first and third trimester, the 
MMP-8 level was higher if TTV was also present (p < 0.0091). The D-lactic acid
level was lower in first trimester samples if TTV was present (p = 0.0334).
Lactobacillus crispatus dominance in first and third trimester samples was higher
when TTV was absent (p < 0.0033). We conclude that TTV is present in the vagina
in many women with normal pregnancy outcomes and that its occurrence is
associated with a lack of L. crispatus dominance, an increase in vaginal MMP-8
and a decrease in D-lactic acid.
