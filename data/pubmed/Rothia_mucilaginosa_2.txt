The etiology of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is not fully
understood. While risk factors such as positive human papilloma virus (HPV)
status, smoking and tobacco use have been identified, they do not account for all
cases of the disease. We aimed to characterize the bacteriome, mycobiome and
mycobiome-bacteriome interactions of oral wash in HNSCC patients and to determine
if they are distinct from those of the oral wash of matched non-HNSCC patients.
Oral wash samples were collected from 46 individuals with HNSCC and 46 controls
for microbiome analyses. We identified three fungal phyla and eleven bacterial
phyla of which Ascomycota (fungi, 72%) and Firmicutes (bacteria, 39%) were the
most dominant, respectively. A number of organisms were identified as being
differentially abundant between oral wash samples from patients with HNSCC and
oral wash samples from those without HNSCC. Of note, strains of Candida albicans 
and Rothia mucilaginosa were differentially abundant and Schizophyllum commune
was depleted in those with HNSCC compared to oral wash from those without HNSCC. 
Our results suggest that the oral cavity of HNSCC patients harbors unique
differences in the mycobiome, bacteriome, and microbiome interactions when
compared to those of control patients.
