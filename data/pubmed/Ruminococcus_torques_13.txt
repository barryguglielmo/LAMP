Potato fiber is a side product in starch manufacturing rich in dietary fibers
such as pectin, cellulose, hemicellulose and resistant starch. So far, the
beneficial properties of potato fiber have been poorly characterized. This study 
investigated the effect of FiberBind 400, a commercial potato fiber product, on
survival of probiotic Lactobacillus strains at simulated gastric conditions and
on the composition and metabolic activity of the gut microbiota, using the TIM-2 
colon model. Resistant starch and native starch from potato were used as
reference substrates. FiberBind 400 had an ability to improve survival of the
four tested strains, Lactobacillus fermentum PCC®, L. rhamnosus LGG®, L. reuteri 
RC-14® and L. paracasei F-19® in a strain-dependent way. The highest effect was
observed for L. fermentum PCC® and L. rhamnosus LGG®. The effect of starches on
bacterial survival was insignificant. Composition of the fecal microbiota in
TIM-2 fermentations was assessed by high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene
amplicon. Fermentation of FiberBind 400 resulted in more diverse microbial
communities compared to starches. Changes in microbial abundances specifically
mediated by FiberBind 400, included increases in the genera Lachnospira,
Butyrivibrio, Mogibacterium, Parabacteroides, Prevotella and Desulfovibrio, and
the species B. ovatus, as well as decreases in Ruminococcus torques and
unassigned Ruminococcus spp. Shifts in other bacterial populations, such as
increased abundances of Oscillospira, Enterococcus, Bacteroidales, Citrobacter,
along with reduction of Roseburia, Ruminococcus, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii
were not significantly different between the substrates. Cumulative production of
individual short-chain fatty acids was similar between potato fiber and starches.
The study demonstrated that FiberBind 400 had a potential to protect probiotic
Lactobacillus strains during the passage through the gastrointestinal tract and
selectively modulate the gut bacterial populations. This knowledge can support
application of potato fiber as a functional food ingredient with added biological
benefits.
