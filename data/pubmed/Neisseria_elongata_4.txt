Bacteremia Caused by Neisseria elongata in an Infective Endocarditis Patient:
Case Report and Review of Literature.

Chen Y, Liu X, Ai L, Guo P, Huang H.

BACKGROUND: Neisseria elongata (N. elongate) is a strictly aerobic and
gram-negative rod bacterium which is a constituent of the commensal bacterial
ï¬‚ora in the pharynx. Infection caused by Neisseria elongata is rarely reported.
Here we describe a case of endocarditis in a patient after aortic mechanical
valve replacement caused by N. elon-gate in China.
METHOD: A 30-year-old man suffered infective endocarditis after aortic mechanical
valve replacement. Blood cultures were positive and the organism was identified
as Neisseria elongata by MALDI-TOF MS as well as the 16S rRNA sequencing.
RESULT: The patient was treated with ofloxacin and meropenem. He was successfully
treated with the 6-week course of antibiotic therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: N. elongate endocarditis is rarely reported. Our report expands the 
range of infection caused by N. elongate.
