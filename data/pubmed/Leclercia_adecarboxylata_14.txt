A plasmid-located fosfomycin resistance gene, fosA8, was identified from a
CTX-M-15-producing Escherichia coli isolate recovered from urine. Identification 
of this gene was obtained by whole-genome sequencing. It encoded FosA8, which
shares 79% and 78% amino acid identity with the most closely related FosA2 and
FosA1 enzymes, respectively. The fosA8 gene was located on a transferable 50-kb
plasmid of IncN type encoding high-level resistance to fosfomycin. In silico
analysis and cloning experiments identified fosA8 analogues (99% identity) in the
genome of Leclercia decarboxylata, which is an enterobacterial species with
natural resistance to fosfomycin. This finding adds L. decarboxylata to the list 
of enterobacterial species that are a reservoir of fosA-like genes which have
been captured from the chromosome of a progenitor and are then acquired by E.
coli.
