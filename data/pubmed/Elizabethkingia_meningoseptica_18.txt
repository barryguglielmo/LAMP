Raw milk microbiota are complex communities with a significant impact on the
hygienic, sensory and technological quality of milk products. However, there is a
lack of knowledge on factors determining their composition. In the present study,
four bulk tank milk samples of two farms at two different time points were
analyzed in detail for their microbiota using cultivation and 16S rRNA amplicon
sequencing. Diversity in samples from the first time point was assessed via
cultivation of 500 aerobic mesophilic bacterial isolates in each sample. A high
biodiversity of 70 and 110 species per sample was determined, of which 25-28%
corresponded to yet unknown taxa. The isolates were dominated by Gram-positive
members of the genera Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Streptococcus, or
Janibacter, whilst Chryseobacterium and Acinetobacter were most abundant among
the Gram-negative taxa. At the second time point, samples of the same farms were 
analyzed via both cultivation (1,500 individual colonies each) and
high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The latter revealed a
threefold higher biodiversity at the genus level, as anaerobic or fastidious
species were also detected. However, cultivation identified genera not captured
by sequencing, indicating that both approaches are complementary. Using amplicon 
sequencing, the relative abundance of a few genera was distorted, which seems to 
be an artifact of sample preparation. Therefore, attention needs to be paid to
the library preparation procedure with special emphasis on cell lysis and PCR.
