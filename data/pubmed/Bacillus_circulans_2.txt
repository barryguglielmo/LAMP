A plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium, Bacillus circulans GN03, was isolated
from the root surface of pak choi cabbage. Here, we report the whole-genome
sequence of the GN03 strain, which includes a circular chromosome (5,217,129 bp; 
GC content, 35.64%) and a plasmid (181,705 bp; GC content, 31.62%).
