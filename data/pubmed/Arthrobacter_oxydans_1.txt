Cladribine is a nucleoside analogue widely used in the pharmaceutical industry
for the treatment of several neoplasms, including hairy-cell leukemia among
others. This compound has also shown efficacy in the treatment of autoimmune
diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. In this work, a
green bioprocess for cladribine biosynthesis using immobilized Arthrobacter
oxydans was developed. The microorganism was stabilized by entrapment
immobilization in the natural matrix alginate. Different reaction parameters were
optimized obtaining a biocatalyst able to achieve cladribine bioconversion values
close to 85% after 1 hr, the shortest reaction times reported so far. The
developed bioprocess was successfully scaled-up reaching a productivity of
138 mg L-1 hr-1 . Also, the biocatalyst was stable for 5 months in storage and in
96 hr at operational conditions.
