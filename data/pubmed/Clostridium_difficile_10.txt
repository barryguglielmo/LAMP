WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Gram-negative bacteremia remains a major health
problem around the world. The optimal duration of antibiotic treatment has been
poorly defined, and there are significant differences of opinion between
clinicians. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the 
clinical outcomes of short-course and long-course treatments in patients with
uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia.
METHODS: We searched public databases (PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library) to
identify eligible studies. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and the 
incidence of recurrent bacteremia through day 30. We used the Cochrane risk of
bias assessment tool to evaluate the risk of bias for randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for non-RCTs.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Six studies involving 2689 patients were included in the 
systematic review and meta-analysis. No significant difference was found between 
short-course and long-course antibiotic treatments in 30-day mortality (risk
ratio [RR] 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65-1.13; P = .26), 30-day
recurrent bacteremia (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.68-1.67; P = .78), 90-day mortality (RR
0.84; 95% CI 0.57-1.24; P = .38), 90-day recurrent bacteremia (RR 0.98; 95% CI
0.50-1.89; P = .94), adverse events (RR 1.14; 95% CI 0.89-1.45; P = .30),
Clostridium difficile infection (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.40-1.86; P = .71) or
resistance development (RR 1.19; 95% CI 0.66-2.14; P = .57).
WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Short-course was non-inferior to long-course
antibiotic treatments for patients with uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia.
Considering the drug-related side effects and cost-effectiveness, a shorter
duration of antibiotic treatment may be preferable for this particular
population. However, additional high-quality RCTs are needed to further assess
whether a shorter course of antibiotic treatment is of greater benefit for
patients with uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia.
