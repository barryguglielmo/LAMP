BACKGROUND: Bacillus velezensis and other Bacillus species are known for the
production of bioactive secondary metabolites that are active against plant
pathogenic fungi. In view of this, a study was undertaken to investigate the
antifungal potential of B. velezensis AR1 culture supernatant.
RESULT: The butanol extract concentrate of B. velezensis AR1 was separated into
different fractions by column chromatography. A fraction eluted by 9:1
chloroform: methanol caused 25.8-70.2% and 25.2-56.3% growth inhibition of
Monilinia fructicola and Colletotricum goeosporioides, respectively. This
fraction was subjected to solid-phase extraction using a Strata SI-1 column and
further purified by prep-TLC to obtain a pure metabolite showing a single peak on
high performance liquid chromatography. On the basis of the nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR 1 H, 13 C, HH COSY, HSQC and HMBC) analysis, the metabolite was
identified as 5-N-tyrosinylornithine. The compound exhibited antifungal activity 
against two plant pathogenic fungi.
CONCLUSION: 5-N-tyrosinylornithine, the secondary metabolite isolated from the
culture supernatant of B. velezensis AR1 exhibited significant antifungal
activity against two plant pathogenic fungi.
