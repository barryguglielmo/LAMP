The present study aims to escalate the production of prophylactic agent
zeaxanthin using a screened potential bacterial isolate. For this purpose, a
freshwater bacterium capable of producing zeaxanthin was isolated from Bor Talav,
Bhavnagar. The 16S rRNA sequence confirmed the isolate as Arthrobacter
gandavensis. The bacterium was also submitted to Microbial Type Culture
Collection, CSIR-Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh, India, with the
accession number MTCC 25325. The chemo-metric tools were employed to optimise the
influencing factors such as pH, temperature, inoculum size, agitation speed,
carbon source and harvest time on zeaxanthin yield. Thereafter, six parameters
were narrowed down to three factors and were optimised using the central
composite design (CCD) matrix. Maximum zeaxanthin (1.51 mg/g) was derived when A.
gandavensis MTCC 25325 was grown under pH 6.0, 1.5% (w/v) glucose and 10% (v/v)
inoculum size. A high regression coefficient (R2= 0.92) of the developed model
indicated the accurateness of the tested parameters. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first report on tailoring the process parameters using
chemo-metric optimisation for escalating the zeaxanthin production by A.
gandavensis MTCC 25325.
