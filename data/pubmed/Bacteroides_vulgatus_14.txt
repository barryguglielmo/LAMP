BACKGROUND: An increasing number of studies have shown that the
brain-gut-microbiota axis may significantly contribute to Alzheimer's disease
(AD) pathogenesis. Moreover, impaired memory and learning involve the dysfunction
neurotransmission of glutamate, the agonist of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor 
and a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. This systematic review
aimed to summarize the current cutting-edge research on the gut microbiota and
glutamate alterations associated with dementia.
METHODS: PubMed, the Cochrane Collaboration Central Register of Controlled
Clinical Trials, and Cochrane Systematic Reviews were reviewed for all studies on
glutamate and gut microbiota in dementia published up until Feb 2020.
RESULTS: Several pilot studies have reported alterations of gut microbiota and
metabolites in AD patients and other forms of dementia. Gut microbiota including 
Bacteroides vulgatus and Campylobacter jejuni affect glutamate metabolism and
decrease the glutamate metabolite 2-keto-glutaramic acid. Meanwhile, gut bacteria
with glutamate racemase including Corynebacterium glutamicum, Brevibacterium
lactofermentum, and Brevibacterium avium can convert l-glutamate to d-glutamate. 
N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR)-enhancing agents have been found 
to potentially improve cognition in AD or Parkinson's disease patients. These
findings suggest that d-glutamate (d-form glutamate) metabolized by the gut
bacteria may influence the glutamate NMDAR and cognitive function in dementia
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Gut microbiota and glutamate are potential novel interventions to be
developed for dementia. Exploring comprehensive cognitive functions in animal and
human trials with glutamate-related NMDAR enhancers are warranted to examine
d-glutamate signaling efficacy in gut microbiota in patients with AD and other
neurodegenerative dementias.
