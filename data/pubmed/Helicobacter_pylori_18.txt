BACKGROUND: We have previously reported that Helicobacter pylori (H.
pylori)-associated nodular gastritis could occur in both the antrum and the
cardia. Cardiac nodularity-like appearance (hereafter, called as cardiac
nodularity) had a high predictive accuracy for the diagnosis of H. pylori
infection. In the previous study, we included only the patients who were
evaluated for H. pylori infection for the ﬁrst time, and excluded patients with a
history of eradication. Therefore, the prevalence and clinical features of
cardiac nodularity remains unknown.
AIM: To perform this cross-sectional study to explore the characteristics of
cardiac nodularity.
METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy between
May, 2017 and August, 2019 in the Toyoshima Endoscopy Clinic were enrolled in
this study. We included H. pylori-negative, H. pylori-positive, and H.
pylori-eradicated patients, and excluded patients with unclear H. pylori status
and eradication failure. H. pylori infection was diagnosed according to serum
anti-H. pylori antibody and the urea breath test or histology. Cardiac nodularity
was defined as a miliary nodular appearance or the presence of scattered whitish 
circular small colorations within 2 cm of the esophagogastric junction.
Nodularity was visualized as whitish in the narrow-band imaging mode. We
collected data on the patients' baseline characteristics.
RESULTS: A total of 1078 patients were finally included. Among H. pylori-negative
patients, cardiac nodularity and antral nodularity were recognized in 0.14% each.
Among H. pylori-positive patients, cardiac nodularity and antral nodularity were 
recognized in 54.5% and 29.5%, respectively. Among H. pylori-eradicated patients,
cardiac nodularity and antral nodularity were recognized in 4.5% and 0.6%,
respectively. The frequency of cardiac nodularity was significantly higher than
that of antral nodularity in H. pylori-positive and -eradicated patients. The
frequencies of cardiac nodularity and antral nodularity in H. pylori-eradicated
patients were significantly lower than those in H. pylori-positive patients (P < 
0.001). The patients with cardiac nodularity were significantly younger than
those without cardiac nodularity (P = 0.0013). Intestinal metaplasia score of the
patients with cardiac nodularity were significantly lower than those without
cardiac nodularity (P = 0.0216). Among H. pylori-eradicated patients, the
patients with cardiac nodularity underwent eradication significantly more
recently compared with those without cardiac nodularity (P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: This report outlines the prevalence and clinical features of cardiac 
nodularity, and confirm its close association with active H. pylori infection.
