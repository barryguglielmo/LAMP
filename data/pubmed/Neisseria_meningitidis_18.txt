INTRODUCTION: Meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis is a major
cause of meningitis and septicemia with high rates of morbidity and mortality
worldwide. MenACWY-TT and MenACWY-CRM197 are meningococcal conjugate vaccines
approved for use in children and adults in the UK. The aim of this review was to 
evaluate and compare antibody responses and persistence in different age groups
after MenACWY-TT and MenACWY-CRM197.
AREAS COVERED: Randomized trials showed that MenACWY-TT is immunogenic at all
ages. MenACWY-CRM197 is immunogenic for infants and adults, but there is a lack
of data for children aged 1 to 2Â years. Studies on MenACWY-TT indicated that
serum bactericidal antibody (SBA) utilizing baby rabbit complement (rSBA) titers 
were significantly higher and more stable than SBA using human complement (hSBA) 
titers, compared with hSBA titers, which were lower and declined more rapidly by 
1 year following post-primary MenACWY-TT and MenACWY-CRM197 vaccination,
especially for MenA.
EXPERT OPINION: MenACWY-TT and MenACWY-CRM197 are both well tolerated and induce 
similar antibody persistence and immunogenicity against all four serogroups for
individuals more than one year old. rSBA assay is a more robust assay than the
hSBA assay when vaccinating with MenACWY-TT, while rSBA and hSBA assays had
similar antibody persistence when vaccinating with MenACWY-CRM197.
