A total of 92 marine bacteria belonging to Pseudomonas, Pseudoalteromonas,
Psychrobacter, and Shewanella were first screened for their proteolytic activity.
In total, four Pseudomonas strains belonging to Ps. fluorescens, Ps. fragi, Ps.
gessardii, and Ps. marginalis; 14 Pseudoalteromonas strains belonging to Psa.
arctica, Psa. carrageenovora, Psa. elyakovii, Psa. issachenkonii, Psa. rubra,
Psa. translucida, and Psa. tunicata; and two Shewanella strains belonging to S.
baltica and S. putrefaciens were identified to have a weak to high proteolytic
activity (from 478 to 4445 mU/mg trypsin equivalent) against skim milk casein as 
protein source. Further chitinolytic activity screening based on these 20
proteolytic strains using colloidal chitin yielded five positive strains which
were tested against three different chitin substrates in order to determine the
various types of chitinases. Among the strains that can produce both proteases
and chitinases, Psa. rubra DSM 6842T expressed not only the highest proteolytic
activity (2558 mU/mg trypsin equivalent) but also the highest activity of
exochitinases, specifically, β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (6.33 mU/107 cfu) as well.
We anticipate that this strain can be innovatively applied to the valorization of
marine crustaceans side streams.
