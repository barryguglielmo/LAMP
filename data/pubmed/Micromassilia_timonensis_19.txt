Two novel, Gram-stain-positive, non-motile, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped
bacteria (strains 2129T and 2119) were isolated from the faeces of Tibetan
antelopes (Pantholops hodgsonii) on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, PR China. The 16S 
rRNA gene sequences of the strains showed highest similarity values to
Actinomyces timonensis DSM 23838T (92.9 and 92.8 %, respectively), and
phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene and genomic sequences indicated that
strains 2129T and 2119 represent a new lineage. Strains 2129T and 2119 could
ferment d-adonitol and d-xylose, but were unable to utilize d-mannose and
d-melibiose nor produce esterase (C4) and proline arylamidase. The G+C contents
of the two strains were both 69.0 mol%. Their genomes exhibited less than 40.4 % 
relatedness in DNA-DNA hybridization tests (below 70 % as the recommended
threshold for new species) with all available genomes of the genus Actinomyces in
the NCBI database. The major fatty acids of the two strains were C18 : 1ω9c and
C16 : 0, and the major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, glycolipid,
phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidyl inositol mannoside and phosphoglycolipid.
Based on the results of genotypic, phenotypic and biochemical analyses, it is
proposed that the two unidentified bacteria be classified as representing a novel
species, Actinomyces lilanjuaniae sp. nov. The type strain is 2129T (=CGMCC
4.7483T=DSM 106426T).
