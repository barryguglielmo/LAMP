We report a case of a rapidly fatal postlaparoscopic cholecystectomy liver
infection from the rarely isolated species Clostridium butyricum. Liver
examination at autopsy showed cystic spaces, necrosis, and spore-forming
Gram-positive rods. 16sRNA gene sequencing of the cystic liver tissue identified 
the organism as C. butyricum.
