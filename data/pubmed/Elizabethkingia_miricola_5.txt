OBJECTIVES: Elizabethkingia is an emerging life-threatening pathogen in both
humans and animals. We describe the whole-genome analysis of an Elizabethkingia
miricola strain isolated from a diseased frog in China and investigate the
molecular mechanism of carbapenem resistance in this pathogen.
METHODS: WGS of E. miricola FL160902 was performed using single-molecule,
real-time technology. A phylogenetic tree was generated by SNP analysis,
comparing the genome of our strain with other E. miricola isolates of amphibian
and human origins. Antimicrobial resistance genes and virulence-related genes
were identified using the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) and
the Virulence Factor Database (VFDB). Two putative carbapenemase genes were
expressed in Escherichia coli to evaluate their contribution to antimicrobial
resistance.
RESULTS: The genome of E. miricola FL160902 consists of a 4 249 586 bp circular
chromosome with 27 putative resistance genes and 38 predicted
virulence-associated genes. Comparative genomic analysis demonstrated that the E.
miricola strains of human and amphibian origins have similar virulence-associated
gene profiles. In addition, all the amphibian isolates clustered together with
one of the human isolates in the phylogenetic analysis. WGS revealed the presence
of two novel MBL genes, designated blaBlaB-16 and blaGOB-19. Cloning of
blaBlaB-16 and blaGOB-19 into E. coli DH5α resulted in increased MICs of most
β-lactams, including imipenem, meropenem and ampicillin.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified two chromosomal MBL gene variants, named blaBlaB-16
and blaGOB-19 in an amphibian E. miricola isolate, which was considered
potentially zoonotic based on phylogenetic analysis and virulence-associated gene
comparison. This study highlights the importance of E. miricola as a potential
zoonotic pathogen and a reservoir of MDR genes.
