Ectoine is a solute compatible with the physiologies of both prokaryotic and
eukaryotic cells and is widely synthesized by bacteria as an osmotic stress
protectant. Because it preserves functional attributes of proteins and
macromolecular complexes, it is considered a chemical chaperone and has found
numerous practical applications. However, the mechanism of its biosynthesis is
incompletely understood. The second step in ectoine biosynthesis is catalyzed by 
l-2,4-diaminobutyrate acetyltransferase (EctA; EC 2.3.1.178), which transfers the
acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to EctB-formed l-2,4-diaminobutyrate (DAB), yielding
N-γ-acetyl-l-2,4-diaminobutyrate (N-γ-ADABA), the substrate of ectoine synthase
(EctC). Here, we report the biochemical and structural characterization of the
EctA enzyme from the thermotolerant bacterium Paenibacillus lautus (Pl). We found
that (Pl)EctA forms a homodimer whose enzyme activity is highly regiospecific by 
producing N-γ-ADABA but not the ectoine catabolic intermediate
N-α-acetyl-l-2,4-diaminobutyric acid. High-resolution crystal structures of
(Pl)EctA (at 1.2-2.2 Å resolution) (i) for its apo-form, (ii) in complex with
CoA, (iii) in complex with DAB, (iv) in complex with both CoA and DAB, and (v) in
the presence of the product N-γ-ADABA were obtained. To pinpoint residues
involved in DAB binding, we probed the structure-function relationship of
(Pl)EctA by site-directed mutagenesis. Phylogenomics shows that EctA-type
proteins from both Bacteria and Archaea are evolutionarily highly conserved,
including catalytically important residues. Collectively, our biochemical and
structural findings yielded detailed insights into the catalytic core of the EctA
enzyme that laid the foundation for unraveling its reaction mechanism.
