Propionibacterium are anaerobic/aero-tolerant rod Gram-positive bacteria, and
numerous studies are associated with primary and secondary endodontic infections.
The data in the literature on the prevalence of Propionibacterium are
conflicting, and there are studies that report conflicting data on the prevalence
in primary and secondary endodontic infections. This review aims to clarify the
prevalence of bacteria of the genus Propionibacterium in endodontic lesions. The 
present systematic review work was performed on the basis of the Prisma protocol.
A search was carried out on the PubMed and Scopus databases with the use of
keywords. The research produced 410 records, which, after the elimination of the 
overlaps and the application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, led to a
number of 36 included articles divided by the three outcomes. The first outcome
concerns prevalence of bacteria of the genus Propionibacterium in primary and
secondary endodontic lesions. The secondary outcome, differences in the
prevalence of bacteria of the genus Propionibacterium between primary endodontic 
infections and secondary endodontic infections. The tertiary outcome, differences
in the prevalence of Propionibacterium Acnes compared to Propionibacterium
propionicum in endodontic infections. The results of the meta-analysis show that 
the genus Propionibacterium bacteria are more prevalent in secondary endodontic
infections and that P. Acnes has a higher prevalence than P. propionicum.
