OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of fermented milk containing Lactobacillus
casei strain Shirota (LcS) on the incidence of constipation, diarrhea, acute
respiratory infections (ARI), and nutritional status of young Vietnamese
children.
METHODS: A controlled field trial was conducted with 1003 children (3-5 years
old) in Thanh Hoa province in Vietnam. The probiotic group (n = 510) consumed
fermented milk 65 mL/day containing 108 CFU/mL of LcS for the 12-week
intervention period, whereas the control group (n = 493) was not given any. The
incidence of constipation, diarrhea, ARI, and anthropometry in children was
determined at baseline, after 4, 8, and 12-week intervention, and after the
4-week follow-up period.
RESULTS: Probiotic drink decreased the incidence of constipation after the
12-week intervention period (12.0% vs. 32.0%, OR = 0.28 (95% CI: 0.21-0.40),
p < 0.001), tended to decrease the incidence of diarrhea (4.9% vs. 7.9%,
OR = 0.60 (95% CI: 0.35-1.01), p = 0.068), and prevented the occurrence of ARI
(15.9% vs. 24.5%, OR = 0.58 (95% CI: 0.42-0.79), p < 0.001), when compared with
the control group. In contrast, no probiotic effects were observed for the
duration of diarrhea or ARI. Weight gain was higher in the probiotic group than
in the control group after 4, 8, and 12-week intervention and after the 4-week
follow-up period (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Daily intake of fermented milk containing LcS strongly prevented the
incidence of constipation and ARI in Vietnamese children. This study also
revealed the potential effects of the use of a probiotic drink on diarrhea
prevention as well as nutritional status improvement.
