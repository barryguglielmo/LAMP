Two previously undescribed, Gram-stain-positive, rod-shaped strains, 410T and
553, were isolated from faeces of the Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsonii)
from the Tibet-Qinghai Plateau, PR China. The optimum growth conditions of the
two novel strains were 1 % (w/v) NaCl, 37 °C and pH 7. The end products from
glucose fermentation included ethanol and lactic acid. Based on results of 16S
rRNA gene sequence comparison and phylogenetic and phylogenomic analyses, strains
410T and 553 were classified into the genus Actinomyces, and were closely related
to Actinomyces ruminicola (97.6 %), Actinomyces oricola (93.5 %) and Actinomyces 
dentalis (90.8 %). The genomic G+C content of strain 410T was 67.4 mol%. Digital 
DNA-DNA hybridization values between strain 410T and each of the closely related 
species were under 70 %. The respiratory quinones were MK-10 (68 %) and MK-9
(32 %). The main cellular fatty acids of the isolates were C16 : 0, followed by
C18 : 1 ω9c. The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol and
phosphatidylinositol-mannoside. The whole-cell sugars contained rhamnose, ribose 
and glucose. The diagnostic amino acids of cell-wall peptidoglycan included
alanine, glutamic acid, lysine and ornithine. The results of biochemical,
chemotaxonomic and genotypic analyses revealed that the two novel strains
represent a novel species of genus Actinomyces, for which the name Actinomyces
qiguomingii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 410T (=CGMCC 1.16361T= DSM
106201T).
