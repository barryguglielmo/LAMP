The identification of biological traces provides vital evidence in forensic
reconstruction at crime scenes, especially in sexual offences. Compared with
traditional presumptive or confirmatory methods, the microbiome-based method has 
been proven to be of great value in body fluid identification. Mixture of body
fluids or tissue is common in sexual assault cases; thus, it is essential to
determine the sources of mixed samples. In this study, 60 samples consisting of
skin, saliva, and a mixed model of saliva deposited on facial skin were collected
from a population living in Guangdong. Through 16s rDNA high-throughput
sequencing, we identified the predominant microbes in saliva samples, viz.,
Haemophilus parainfluenzae T3T1, Neisseria flava, Gemella haemolysans, Prevotella
melaninogenica, and Actinomyces odontolyticus; in skin samples, Cutibacterium
acnes and Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum were the predominant species. The
microbial composition of the same body fluid or tissue is similar in different
individuals. However, among different body fluids or tissue, the composition of
microflora in saliva is more stable than that on skin. Additionally, the
microbial community in the mixed model of saliva deposited on facial skin from
the same and different individuals was clearly determined by the constituent
fluids or tissue, apart from the differences among the donors. Overall, the
microbiome-based method may have good potential as a tool for identifying single 
and mixed body fluid or tissue.
