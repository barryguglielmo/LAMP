The skin colonizing coagulase-negative Staphylococcus epidermidis causes
nosocomial infections and is an important opportunistic and highly adaptable
pathogen. To gain more insight into this species, we sequenced the genome of the 
biofilm positive, methicillin susceptible S. epidermidis O47 strain (hereafter
O47). This strain belongs to the most frequently isolated sequence type 2. In
comparison to the RP62A strain, O47 can be transformed, which makes it a
preferred strain for molecular studies. S. epidermidis O47's genome has a single 
chromosome of about 2.5 million base pairs and no plasmid. Its oriC sequence has 
the same directionality as S. epidermidis RP62A, S. carnosus, S. haemolyticus, S.
saprophyticus and is inverted in comparison to Staphylococcus aureus and S.
epidermidis ATCC 12228. A phylogenetic analysis based on all S. epidermidis
genomes currently available at GenBank revealed that O47 is closest related to
DAR1907. The genome of O47 contains genes for the typical global regulatory
systems known in staphylococci. In addition, it contains most of the genes
encoding for the typical virulence factors for S. epidermidis but not for S.
aureus with the exception of a putative hemolysin III. O47 has the typical S.
epidermidis genetic islands and several mobile genetic elements, which include
staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) of about 54 kb length and two prophages 
φO47A and φO47B. However, its genome has no transposons and the smallest number
of insertion sequence (IS) elements compared to the other known S. epidermidis
genomes. By sequencing and analyzing the genome of O47, we provide the basis for 
its utilization in genetic and molecular studies of biofilm formation.
