A stable biocatalyst with magnetic properties based on immobilized Lactobacillus 
animalis ATCC 35,046 to obtain 2-chloroadenine-2'-deoxyriboside, known as
cladribine, is reported for the first time. This nucleoside analogue is an
antitumor agent used in the treatment of a wide variety of types of leukemia. In 
this study, an eco-compatible and alternative bioprocess to obtain cladribine was
developed. Product conversion was close to 90% at 2 h in optimized
nonconventional reaction media. The microscale biosynthesis of the compound of
interest afforded a total productivity close to 370 mg/L/h in the presence of
DMSO, and it was stable at least for 30 days in storage conditions.
