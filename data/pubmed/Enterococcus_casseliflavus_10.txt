The demand for steviol glycosides, non-caloric sweet components of Stevia
rebaudiana Bertoni (stevia) leaves, has increased considerably as a benefit to
enhance human health. However, the supply has remained challenging due to limited
production, with the lack of a specific steviol glycoside hydrolyzing enzyme. In 
this study, a novel β-glucosidase (EcBgl) from Enterococcus casseliflavus was
cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. An EcBgl consists of 721 amino acids
corresponding to a molecular mass of 79.37 kDa. The EcBgl was purified to
homogeneity, followed by enzyme characterization. The enzyme showed optimum pH
and temperature at 6.0 and 37 °C, and exhibited the kinetic constants kcat/Km for
pNPG and kcat/Km for stevioside of 8583 mM-1s-1 and 95.41 mM-1s-1, respectively. 
When compared to the stevioside hydrolyzing β-glycosidases previously reported,
EcBgl was found to be the most efficient enzyme. EcBgl also rendered hydrolysis
of the stevioside to produce rubusoside, a rare steviol glycoside with a
pharmaceutical solubilizing property, by cleaving at the glucose moiety. In
addition, the enzyme demonstrated substantial resistance against amygdalin, so it
served as a potential enzyme in agricultural and pharmaceutical applications.
