L-asparaginase is an important enzyme with diverse applications in food industry 
and therapeutics. However, the enzyme currently employed in the treatment of
leukaemias, comes with undesired L-glutaminase activity. A gene encoding 38 kDa
L-asparaginase form Anoxybacillus flavithermus was cloned and expressed in
Escherichia coli as a soluble and active enzyme. Heat treatment and Ni-affinity
column chromatography provided highly purified enzyme possessing a specific
activity of 165 units mg-1. The enzyme exhibited allosteric behaviour with a Hill
coefficient of 1.60 and K0.5 of 25 mM with L-asparagine as specific substrate. No
detectable activity was observed in the presence of D-asparagine, l-glutamine and
d-glutamine. Purified AfASNase showed optimum activity at 60 °C and pH 7.0. The
enzyme had ability to withstand up to 6 M urea and showed complete inactivation
when treated with 1 M guanidine hydrochloride. Protein-Ligand docking and
molecular dynamic simulations indicated that the regulatory site is formed by
T262-T263-C265-G269-Thr294 and is located on a domain different from the one
carrying the well-established active site. AfASNase is reported as first
thermostable L-asparaginase with allosteric regulation. Hitherto, AfASNase
presents the first characterization of recombinant L-asparaginase from the genus 
Anoxybacillus.
