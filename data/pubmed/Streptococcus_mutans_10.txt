Zinc-fluoride glass nanoparticles (Zinc-F) release several ions, such as
fluoride, zinc and calcium ions, through acid-base reactions. The aim of this
study was to evaluate the antibacterial and cytotoxic properties of Zinc-F.
Antibacterial tests showed that a Zinc-F eluting solution significantly reduced
the turbidity and colony-forming units of Streptococcus mutans and Actinomyces
naeslundii, compared to that of calcium-fluoroaluminosilicate glass nanoparticles
without zinc ions. In live/dead staining, Zinc-F eluate significantly decreased
green-stained bacterial cells, indicating live cells, compared with the control
(no application). Human dentin coated with Zinc-F showed suppressed S. mutans and
A. naeslundii biofilm formation. Additionally, Zinc-F eluate showed low cytotoxic
effects in osteoblastic and fibroblastic cells. Therefore, our findings suggested
that Zinc-F exhibits antibacterial and biocompatible properties through
multiple-ion release.
