Tigecycline was previously considered to have activity against
vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) isolates, but the optimal dose was not
clarified. Thus, this study assessed the in vitro activity of tigecycline against
clinical VRE isolates to determine its optimal regimens for complicated
intra-abdominal (cIAIs) and complicated skin/soft tissue infections (cSSTIs). We 
used Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the probability of target attainment
(PTA) and the cumulative fraction of response for the ratio of the free area
under the curve to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (fAUIC24), which
were 17.9 and 6.9 for treating cSSTIs and cIAIs, respectively. All clinical
isolates were Enterococcus faecium. Only a maintenance dose of 200 mg/day
tigecycline gave the target attainment of fAUIC24 >17.9, and PTA exceeded 90% for
MIC ≤0.38 μg/mL. Meanwhile, this dose gave the target attainment of fAUIC24 >6.9,
and PTA exceeded 90% for MIC ≤1 μg/mL. All simulated tigecycline dosing regimens 
met the fAUIC24 targets more than 90% of the cumulative fraction of response.
Despite its apparent efficacy, a daily tigecycline dose of 200 mg is recommended 
for VRE isolates with MICs of ≤0.38 μg/mL and ≤1 μg/mL for treating cSSTIs and
cIAIs, respectively.
