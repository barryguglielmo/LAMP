BACKGROUND: Recently, it has been found that the gut microbiota may affect the
development of lung cancer through the "gut-lung axis." To investigate this
relationship, we performed this study to determine whether the gut microbiota in 
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is different from that in healthy
adults.
METHODS: Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to detect the expression levels of
eight gut butyrate-producing bacteria in healthy adults and NSCLC patients. We
enrolled 30 patients with NSCLC and 30 subjects from 100 healthy adults after
matching for age and sex.
RESULTS: Compared to healthy adults, most of the gut butyrate-producing bacteria 
in NSCLC patients were significantly decreased; these included Faecalibacterium
prausnitzii, Clostridium leptum, Clostridial cluster I, Ruminococcus spp.,
Clostridial Cluster XIVa, and Roseburia spp. Among the gut butyrate-producing
bacteria, we analyzed Clostridial cluster IV and Eubacterium rectale were not
decreased in NSCLC patients.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that NSCLC patients had gut butyrate-producing bacteria 
dysbiosis. Further studies should be performed to investigate the underlying
mechanisms of how these specific bacteria affect lung cancer progression and
prognosis.
