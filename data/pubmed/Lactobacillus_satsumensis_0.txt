The probiotic characteristics of three acid-tolerant microbial strains, viz.,
Lactobacillus satsumensis LPBF1, Leuconostoc mesenteroides LPBF2 and Saccharomyes
cerevisiae LPBF3, isolated from a honey-based kefir functional beverage, were
studied following the requirements established by the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nation/World Health Organization (FAO/WHO), including 
host-associated stress resistance, epithelium adhesion ability, and antimicrobial
activity. The three microbial strains tolerated different pH values (2.0, 3.0,
4.0 and 7.0) and bile salt concentrations (0.3% and 0.6%), and survive in the
presence of simulated gastric juice, which are conditions imposed by the
gastrointestinal tract. In addition, they showed high percentages of
hydrophobicity, auto aggregation and anti-pathogenic against Escherichia coli and
Staphylococcus aureus, with no hemolytic activity. The protective capacity of
human DNA through microbial treatment was investigated by single-cell gel
electrophoresis (SCGE) comet assay. The three selected strains showed DNA
protection effect against damage caused by hydroxyl radical (H2O2). However, when
the S. cerevisiae treatment was applied, the most effective DNA protection index 
was observed, which can be associated to its high production of extracellular
antioxidants as reveled by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazylhydrate (DPPH)
method. These results indicated that the three selected microbial strains could
be useful for preventing oxidative DNA damage and cellular oxidation in food
products. As well-adapted microbial cells, the selected strains can be used for
production of non-dairy functional beverages, especially for vegans and/or
vegetarians and lactose intolerants.
