The O-specific polysaccharide (OPS) was isolated from the lipopolysaccharide of
Aeromonas veronii bv. sobria strain Pt393, which is pathogenic to the rainbow
trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), after mild acid hydrolysis followed by GPC. The
high-molecular-weight OPS fraction was studied with chemical methods, mass
spectrometry, and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy techniques, including 2D 1H,1H
COSY, TOCSY, NOESY, 1H-detected heteronuclear 1H,13C HSQC, and HMBC experiments. 
It was found that the O-specific polysaccharide was built of a tetrasaccharide
repeating unit composed of α-GalpNAc, α-FucpNAc, β-QuipNAc, and α-Fucp4NAc
(4-acetamido-4,6-dideoxy-d-galactose, tomosamine) residues. The following
structure of the OPS of A. sobria strain Pt393 was established:
→4)-α-d-GalpNAc-(1 → 3)-α-l-FucpNAc-(1 → 3)-β-d-QuipNAc-(1 → 3)-α-d-Fucp4NAc-(1→.
