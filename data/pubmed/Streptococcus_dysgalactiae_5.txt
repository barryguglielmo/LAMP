BACKGROUND: Streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis (SDSE) acts as an
etiological agent for lameness, neurological signs, and high mortality in pigs.
Despite its importance in pig industries and zoonotic potential, little is known 
about the effects of this pathogen.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the molecular characteristics and
antimicrobial resistance of SDSE strains isolated from diseased pigs.
METHODS: A total 11 SDSE isolates were obtained from diseased pigs. Bacterial
identification, PCR for virulence genes, emm typing, and antimicrobial resistance
genes, multilocus sequence typing, and antimicrobial susceptibility test were
performed.
RESULTS: Nine isolates were from piglets, and 8 showed lameness, sudden death, or
neurological signs. The isolates were PCR-positive for sla (100%), sagA (100%),
and scpA (45.5%), and only 1 isolate amplified the emm gene (stL2764). Eight
different sequence types were detected, categorized into 2 clonal complexes and 4
singletons. All the isolates in this study were included in a small cluster,
which also contained other strains derived from humans and horses. The minimum
inhibitory concentrations for the tested beta-lactams were low, while those for
macrolides, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones were relatively high. PCR
analysis of the macrolide and tetracycline resistance genes demonstrated that the
isolates carried erm(B) (18.2%, n = 2), mef(A/E) (9.1%, n = 1), tet(M) (18.2%, n 
= 2), and tet(O) (90.2%, n = 10). Two isolates presented a mutation in parC,
which is associated with fluoroquinolone resistance.
CONCLUSION: This study provided insight into swine-derived SDSE, as it is related
to veterinary medicine, and elucidated its zoonotic potential, in the context of 
molecular epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance in public health.
