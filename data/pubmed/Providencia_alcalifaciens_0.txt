Soil biomes are vast, exceptionally diverse and crucial to the health of
ecosystems and societies. Soils also contain an appreciable, but understudied,
diversity of opportunistic human pathogens. With climate change and other forms
of environmental degradation potentially increasing exposure risks to soilborne
pathogens, it is necessary to gain a better understanding of their ecological
drivers. Here we use the Galleria mellonella insect virulence model to
selectively isolate pathogenic bacteria from soils in Cornwall (United Kingdom). 
We find a high prevalence of pathogenic soil bacteria with two genera,
Providencia and Serratia, being especially common. Providencia alcalifaciens, P. 
rustigianii, Serratia liquefaciens and S. plymuthica strains were studied in more
detail using phenotypic virulence- and antibiotic resistance assays and
whole-genome sequencing. Both genera displayed low levels of antibiotic
resistance and antibiotic resistance gene carriage. However, Serratia isolates
were found to carry the recently characterised metallo-Î²-lactamase blaSPR-1 that,
although not conferring high levels of resistance in these strains, poses a
potential risk of horizontal transfer to other pathogens where it could be fully 
functional. The Galleria assay can be a useful approach to uncover the
distribution and identity of pathogenic bacteria in the environment, as well as
uncover resistance genes with an environmental origin. This article is protected
