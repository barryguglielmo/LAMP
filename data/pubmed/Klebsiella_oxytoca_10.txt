OBJECTIVE: Antibiotic resistance (AR) is a growing and highly prevalent problem
in nursing homes. We describe selected AR phenotypes from pathogens causing
urinary tract infections (UTIs) reported by nursing homes to the National
Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).
DESIGN: Pathogens and antibiotic susceptibility testing results for UTI events in
nursing homes between January 2013 and December 2017 were analyzed. The pathogen 
distribution and pooled mean proportion of isolates that tested resistant to
select antibiotic agents are reported.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: US nursing homes voluntarily participating in the
Long-Term Care Facility component of the NHSN.
RESULTS: Overall, 243 nursing homes reported 1 or more UTIs: 121 (50%) were
nonprofit facilities, median bed size was 91 (range: 9-801), and average
occupancy was 87%. In total, 6,157 pathogens were reported for 5,485 UTI events. 
Moreover, 9 pathogens accounted for 90% of all reported UTIs; the 3 most
frequently identified were Escherichia coli (41%), Proteus species (14%), and
Klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca (13%). Among E. coli, fluoroquinolone, and
extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance were most prevalent (50% and 20%,
respectively). Although Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium
represented <5% of pathogens reported, they had the highest rates of resistance
(67% methicillin resistant and 60% vancomycin resistant, respectively). Multidrug
resistance was most common in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11%). For the resistant
phenotypes we assessed, 36% of all UTIs reported were associated with a resistant
pathogen.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first summary of AR among common pathogens causing UTIs 
reported to NHSN by nursing homes. Improved understanding of the resistance
burden among common infections helps inform facility infection prevention and
antibiotic stewardship efforts.
