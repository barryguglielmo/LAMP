The aim of the present study was to investigate biosurfactant production ability 
of five different polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-metabolizing bacteria, such as
Ochrobactrum anthropi IITR07, Pseudomonas mendocina IITR46, Microbacterium
esteraromaticum IITR47, Pseudomonas aeruginosa IITR48, and Stenotrophomonas
maltophilia IITR87. These bacteria showed biosurfactant production using 2%
glucose as rich substrate; strain IITR47 yielded the highest with 906 and 534
mg/L biosurfactant in the presence of naphthalene and crude oil as the unique
carbon sources. P. aeruginosa IITR48 showed the least surface tension at 29 N/m
and the highest emulsification index at 63%. The biosurfactants produced were
identified as glycolipid and rhamnolipid based on Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy analysis. In particular, the biosurfactant produced by bacteria S.
maltophilia IITR87 efficiently emulsified mustard oil with an E24 value of 56%.
It was observed that, all five biosurfactants from these degrader strains removed
2.4-, 1.7-, 0.9-, 3.8-, and 8.3-fold, respectively, crude oil from contaminated
cotton cloth. Rhamnolipid derived from IITR87 was most efficient, exhibiting
highest desorption of crude oil. These biosurfactants exhibited good stability
without significantly losing its emulsification ability under extreme conditions,
thus can be employed for bioremediation of PAHs from diverse contaminated
ecosystem. Graphical Abstract.
