2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), one of the top biomass-based platform
chemical, is highly promising for resins and polymers, and it can be prepared
from the bio-oxidation of hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF), which can be obtained
mainly from lignocellulosic glucose that has a high production potential from not
edible biomass.A native strain, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus NL14, that could
convert HMF into FDCA is used for combining degradation and fermentation by
consolidated bioprocessing (CBP). In this study, it was observed that the initial
HMF concentration and pH neutralizer played important roles in the bioconversion 
of HMF, 5 g/L of HMF could be converted by 100% within 48 h with 0.5 g/L sodium
carbonate (Na2CO3) with the production of 0.31 g/L FDCA. Extra glucose and
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) addition could further promote the production of FDCA to
0.54 g/L with 100% HMF conversion and a higher conversion rate. This report could
provide a potential native bacterium for furan chemicals bioconversion and
bioelimination, especially for FDCA bioproduction.
