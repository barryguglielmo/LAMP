Field-deployable detectors of disease biomarkers provide a simple and fast
analysis of clinical specimens. However, most of the existing field-deployable
diagnostics have poor sensitivity and are not suitable for the detection of
biomarkers with low abundance. Herein, we report a highly sensitive and rapid
colorimetric readout paper-based assay for pathogen detection by integrating the 
unique collateral activity of a Cas12a-activated universal field-deployable
detector (CUFD). The collateral effect of Cas12a results in a nonspecific
destruction of a fluorophore biotin-labeled ssDNA reporter for the CUFD. This
technique can quantify seven different kinds of pathogens in blood samples
without any purification procedure, with sensitivity as low as 10 aM for the
Shigella dysenteriae DNA. This CUFD technique has significant potential for the
detection of pathogenic DNA as well as other types of DNA or RNA targets at the
point-of-care application.
