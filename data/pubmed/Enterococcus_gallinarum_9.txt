OBJECTIVES: Enterococci have gained attention during the past decade as important
nosocomial pathogens. Their increasing prevalence has been paralleled by the
occurrence of multidrug-resistant and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant
strains. This study isolated Enterococcus spp. from hospital samples and
determined their antibiotic resistance profile, focusing on aminoglycosides, and 
associated resistance mechanisms.
METHODS: A total of 195 enterococci from hospital samples in Tehran were studied.
Isolates were identified by biochemical reactions. Antimicrobial resistance was
determined by disk diffusion. The vancomycin MIC for vancomycin-resistant
isolates was determined by agar dilution. Detection of aminoglycoside resistance 
genes and intI1 and intI2 gene was performed by PCR.
RESULTS: The majority of isolates were Enterococcus faecalis (65.1%), followed by
Enterococcus faecium (31.8%), Enterococcus gallinarum (2.6%) and Enterococcus
solitarius (0.5%). According to antibiogram results, 42.1% of isolates were
high-level gentamicin-resistant (HLGR) and 40.5% were high-level
streptomycin-resistant (HLSR). There was a high prevalence of
aac(6')-Ie-aph(2")-Ia (96.3%) among HLGR isolates. ant(6)-Ia and aadA were
identified in 93.7% and 64.6% of HLSR isolates, respectively. aph(2'')-Ic was
detected in 7 isolates (3.6%) and aph(2'')-Ib in only 4 isolates (2.1%); no
isolates harboured aph(2'')-Id, intI1 or intI2.
CONCLUSION: Multidrug resistance was higher among HLGR and HLSR isolates compared
with non-HLGR and non-HLSR isolates, which may result in limited treatment
options. More than 50% of isolates were susceptible to aminoglycosides, thus
correct identification in clinical laboratories and administration of these
antibiotics can result in decreased used of antibiotics such as vancomycin and
linezolid and help to reduce the emergence of resistance to these drugs.
