Background: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of
different root canal disinfection techniques in the elimination of a
multi-species biofilm from inside the root canal.
Material and Methods: Fifty mandibular first premolars were used in the present
study, standardized to 11mm of root length, and instrumented with a reciprocation
system Reciproc, (VDW GmbH, Munich, Germany) to a #50. Longitudinally sectioned
halves of the roots were obtained and washed with NaOCl 4%, EDTA 17% and 5%
sodium thiosulfate, and sterilized by autoclaving for 15 minutes at 121°C. A
multi-species biofilm broth was developed with three strains of bacteria under
laboratory conditions: Enterococcus faecalis ATTC 29212, Eikenella corrodens ATTC
23834, Streptococcus anginosus ATTC 33397. Roots were autoclaved and transferred 
to the broth for 4 days and then were subjected to either disinfection with
sodium hypochlorite 4% and XP-endo Finisher (FKG Dentaire, La Chaux-de-Fonds,
Switzerland) or chlorhexidine 2% with and without activation with XP-endo
Finisher (FKG Dentaire, La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland).
Results: The evaluations of the biofilm elimination showed results that indicate 
that the 4% sodium hypochlorite group with positive pressure irrigation presented
significant differences with the group that had irrigation with sodium
hypochlorite activated with XP-endo Finisher and the chlorhexidine groups to 2%
(P<0.05).
Conclusions: Chlorhexidine 2% activated with the XP-endo Finisher does not exert 
elimination or improved cleaning effect on the multi-species biofilm. Activation 
of sodium hypochlorite 4% improved the elimination of the multi-species biofilm. 
Key words:Biofilm, multispecies, chlorhexidine, sodium hypochlorite.
