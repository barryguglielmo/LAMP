Banana ripening is a complex molecular process that produces visible changes in
the texture, aroma, taste and nutritional content. Ripening is controlled by
genetic code, metabolic pathway and associated microbiome. We reported the
microbial community structure during banana ripening with alcohol treatment to
discover endophytic and epiphytic microbes. We observed the pulp and peel from
the first and seventh days of Cavendish (Musa acuminata cv. Cavendish) from
mature green fruit and treated with 70% alcohol or distilled water sum up to
eight samples and applied the 16S rRNA Illumina sequencing from V3-V4 gene
region. After quality check 144,368 sequences were obtained in the dataset
comprising a total read length of 1,237,805 base pairs. A sum of 199 genera were 
successfully isolated, with genera Alcaligenes was the most dominant genera at
56.65% and followed by more than 1% were genera Acinetobacter, Enhydrobacter,
Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomas, Thermus, and Aerococcus using mothur pipelines. The 
highest diversity sample with 101 unique genera was belongs to distilled water
treated raw bananas peel (NN1K) and the lowest diversity at 38 was belongs to
distilled water treated ripe bananas pulp (NN7D). The metagenome data are
available at NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database and Biosample under
accession number PRJNA590572. The data contribute to discover different bacterial
communities during post-harvest treatment.
