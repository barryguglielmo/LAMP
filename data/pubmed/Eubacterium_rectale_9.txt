MAD7 is an engineered class 2 type V-A CRISPR-Cas (Cas12a/Cpf1) system isolated
from Eubacterium rectale. Analogous to Cas9, it is an RNA-guided nuclease with
demonstrated gene editing activity in Escherichia coli and yeast cells. Here, we 
report that MAD7 is capable of generating indels and fluorescent gene tagging of 
endogenous genes in human HCT116 and U2OS cancer cell lines, respectively. In
addition, MAD7 is highly proficient in generating indels, small DNA insertions
(23 bases), and larger integrations ranging from 1 to 14 kb in size in mouse and 
rat embryos, resulting in live-born transgenic animals. Due to the different
protospacer adjacent motif requirement, small-guide RNA, and highly efficient
targeted gene disruption and insertions, MAD7 can expand the CRISPR toolbox for
genome enginnering across different systems and model organisms.
