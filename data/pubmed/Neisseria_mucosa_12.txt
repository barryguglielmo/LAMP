Neisseria gonorrhoeae, an obligatory human pathogen causes the sexually
transmitted disease gonorrhea, which remains a global health problem. N.
gonorrhoeae primarily infects the mucosa of the genitourinary tract, which in
women, is colonized by natural microbiota, dominated by Lactobacillus spp., that 
protect human cells against pathogens. In this study, we demonstrated that
precolonization of human epithelial cells with Lactobacillus crispatus, one of
the most prevalent bacteria in the female urogenital tract, or preincubation with
the L. crispatus enolase or glutamine synthetase impairs the adhesion and
invasiveness of N. gonorrhoeae toward epithelial cells, two crucial steps in
gonococcal pathogenesis. Furthermore, decreased expression of genes encoding the 
proinflam-matory cytokines, TNFα and CCL20, which are secreted as a consequence
of N. gonorrhoeae infection, was observed in N. gonorrhoeae-infected epithelial
cells that had been preco-lonized with L. crispatus or preincubated with enolase 
and glutamine synthetase. Thus, our results indicate that the protection of human
cells against N. gonorrhoeae infection is a complex process and that L. crispatus
and its proteins enolase and glutamine synthetase can have a potential role in
protecting epithelial cells against gonococcal infection. Therefore, these
results are important since disturbances of the micro-biota or of its proteins
can result in dysbiosis, which is associated with increased susceptibility of
epithelium to pathogens.
