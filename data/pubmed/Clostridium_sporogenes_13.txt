While the knowledge on gut microbiota - C. difficile interactions has improved
over the years, the understanding of the underlying mechanisms providing
colonization resistance as well as preventative measures against the infection
remain incomplete. In this study the antibiotic clindamycin and polyphenol
extracts from pomegranate and blueberries were used individually and in
combination to modulate fecal microbial communities in minibioreactor arrays
(MBRA). Modulated communities were inoculated with C. difficile (ribotype 027).
Subsequent 7-day periodical monitoring included evaluation of C. difficile growth
and activity of toxins TcdA and TcdB as well as analysis of MBRA bacterial
community structure (V3V4 16â€‰S metagenomics). Polyphenols affected multiple
commensal bacterial groups and showed different synergistic and antagonistic
effects in combination with clindamycin. Exposure to either clindamycin or
polyphenols led to the loss of colonization resistance against C. difficile. The 
successful growth of C. difficile was most significantly correlated with the
decrease in Collinsella and Lachnospiraceae. Additionally, we demonstrated that
Clostridium sporogenes decreased the activity of both C. difficile toxins TcdA
and TcdB. The feature was shown to be common among distinct C. sporogenes strains
and could potentially be applicable as a non-antibiotic agent for the alleviation
of C. difficile infection.
