The stem bark of Ancistrocarpus densispinosus Oliv. exhibited triterpenoids,
including the rare fernane-type, fern-9(11)-ene-2α,3β-diol (1) a possible
chemotaxonomically distinct biomolecule for the genus. Other triterpenoids that
were isolated from this plant include the ursane-type ursolic acid (2) and
corosolic acid (3), friedelane-type friedelin (4) and canophyllol (5),
lupane-type lupeol (6), betulin (7), betulinic acid (8) and hennadiol (9),
oleanoic acid (10), maslinic acid (11) and taraxerol (12) and three sterols. This
is the first report of the chemistry of a plant of the Ancistrocarpus. The
structures of the compounds were elucidated based on their NMR, IR and MS
techniques and by comparisons of their experimental data with those reported. The
twelve triterpenoids 1-12 were found to be inactive against five bacterial
strains Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas agarici, Micrococcus
luteus and Staphylococcus warneri; inactive against KB-3-1 cervix carcinoma
cancer cell line and inactive as antioxidants in the DPPH assay.
