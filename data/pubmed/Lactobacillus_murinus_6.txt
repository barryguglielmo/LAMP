In this study, we fed ICR mice with a high-sucrose diet containing 20% w/w of
milk-casein (MC), egg-white (EW), or soy-protein (SP) for 14 days in order to
detect the presence of protein-susceptible gut indigenous bacteria (P-SIB). The
caecal microbiome was examined by 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing using a
next-generation MiSeq system. Principal coordinate analysis of the operational
taxonomic units (OTUs) revealed that the microbiomes differed among the three
groups. Typical SIB found in the MC-fed group were Bacteroides acidifaciens-,
Bacteroides sartorii-, Eisenbergiella sp., and Lachnospiraceae sp.-like; in the
EW-fed group were Lactobacillus murinus and Enterococcus faecium/avium-like; and 
in the SP-fed group were Muribaculaceae sp.-like bacteria. We also found that a
few Lachnospiraceae sp.- and Clostridium disporicum-like bacteria were suppressed
in the EW-fed mice. Out of the P-SIB detected, B. acidifaciens, L. murinus, E.
faecium, and E. avium could be isolated and identified using BL agar and 16S rDNA
BLAST search, respectively.
