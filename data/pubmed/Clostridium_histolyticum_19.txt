BACKGROUND: Collagenase clostridium histolyticum is a recognized non-surgical
management for Peyronie's disease, licenced for use in the UK for patients with a
palpable plaque and a curvature deformity of at least 30°. However, it is not
currently funded for use within the National Health Service. Collagenase
clostridium histolyticum has also recently been withdrawn from the European and
other markets worldwide, but there is potential for this to be produced
off-patent in the future.
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether collagenase clostridium histolyticum is
cost-neutral when compared to surgical management within a public health care
system, using the National Health Service as an example.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two published protocols for the administration of
collagenase in Peyronie's disease were identified-the 'IMPRESS protocol' and the 
'London protocol'. Costs were taken from published NHS literature. Surgical
intervention rates after collagenase clostridium histolyticum administration and 
primary penile plication were taken from published literature. The costs of the
two published protocols were calculated with costs of any repeat surgical
intervention were included within each protocol per patient cost.
RESULTS: At the current cost per vial of collagenase to the National Health
Service, the IMPRESS protocol per patient costs £3,832.77 (143.7%) more than
primary surgery, whilst the London protocol costs £70.77 (2.7%) more than primary
surgery.
DISCUSSION: At a cost of £548.41 per vial, collagenase administered under the
London protocol would be a management option for Peyronie's disease cost neutral 
to primary corrective surgery.
CONCLUSION: Central funding of collagenase in a public healthcare system would
enable the management of Peyronie's disease to be moved to the outpatient
setting. For this to be done at no additional cost to the NHS, it would require a
cost reduction per vial of collagenase of £23.59 (4.1%), to a cost of £548.41.
