We previously reported the emergence and high prevalence of group B streptococci 
(GBS) with reduced penicillin susceptibility (PRGBS) clinical isolates in Japan. 
PRGBS tend to be also non-susceptible to both macrolides and fluoroquinolones. In
our previous study, we found that the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of
daptomycin for one clinical isolate of GBS was above the "susceptible" breakpoint
approved by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) susceptibility
breakpoint. This suggests the possibility of unrecognized spread of
daptomycin-non-susceptible clinical GBS isolates in Japan. This study aimed to
analyze the daptomycin susceptibility among the 1,046 clinical GBS isolates that 
were recovered since the approval of daptomycin in Japan. MICs of daptomycin for 
the 1,046 clinical isolates were determined by the microdilution method
recommended by the CLSI. The MIC range was 0.12-1 µg/ml, and the MIC50 and MIC90 
were 0.5 µg/ml and 1 µg/ml, respectively. None of the GBS isolates evaluated in
this study was non-susceptible to daptomycin. Therefore, at present, daptomycin
might be considered as a new option to treat GBS infections, especially,
multidrug-resistant PRGBS infections.
