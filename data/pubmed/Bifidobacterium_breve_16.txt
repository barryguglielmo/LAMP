Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are a mixture of structurally diverse
carbohydrates that contribute to shape a healthy gut microbiota composition. The 
great diversity of the HMOs structures does not allow the attribution of specific
prebiotic characteristics to single milk oligosaccharides. We analyze here the
utilization of four disaccharides, lacto-N-biose (LNB), galacto-N-biose (GNB),
fucosyl-α1,3-GlcNAc (3FN) and fucosyl-α1,6-GlcNAc (6FN), that form part of HMOs
and glycoprotein structures, by the infant fecal microbiota. LNB significantly
increased the total levels of bifidobacteria and the species Bifidobacterium
breve and Bifidobacterium bifidum. The Lactobacillus genus levels were increased 
by 3FN fermentation and B. breve by GNB and 3FN. There was a significant
reduction of Blautia coccoides group with LNB and 3FN. In addition, 6FN
significantly reduced the levels of Enterobacteriaceae family members.
Significantly higher concentrations of lactate, formate and acetate were produced
in cultures containing either LNB or GNB in comparison with control cultures.
Additionally, after fermentation of the oligosaccharides by the fecal microbiota,
several Bifidobacterium strains were isolated and identified. The results
presented here indicated that each, LNB, GNB and 3FN disaccharide, might have a
specific beneficial effect in the infant gut microbiota and they are potential
prebiotics for application in infant foods.
