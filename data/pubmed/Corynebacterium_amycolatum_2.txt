Infectious causes of myositis are reported relatively uncommonly in horses. Among
them, bacterial causes include Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus,
Actinobacillus equuli, Fusobacterium spp. Staphylococcus spp, and Corynebacterium
pseudotuberculosis. Infection can be spread to muscles via haematogenous or
extension from skin lesions. Parasitic myositis has also been documented. In this
report, a 12 year-old Italian Quarter Horse mare presented with diffuse
subcutaneous nodules and masses ranging from 2 × 3 to 5 × 20 cm in size, and
adherent to subcutis and muscles that were first macroscopically and
cytologically diagnosed as pyogranulomas. Subsequently, histological, molecular, 
bacteriological, and biochemical investigations were performed. All the data
obtained allowed to diagnose a severe and diffuse multibacterial granulomatous
myositis caused by Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and Corynebacterium
amycolatum. Following the therapy and an initial disappearance of most of the
lesions together with a general improvement of the mare, the clinical condition
deteriorated, and new nodules appeared. Matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) and PCR techniques revealed the 
presence of bacteria as Glutamicibacter creatinolyticus and Dietzia spp. To the
authors' knowledge, this case report represents the first description of
multibacterial granulomatous myositis due to Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, 
Corynebacterium amycolatum, Glutamicibacter creatinolyticus, and Dietzia spp. in 
a horse reared in Italy.
