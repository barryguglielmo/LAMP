METHOD: We examined faecal samples, using the GA-map™ Dysbiosis Test, to
associate gut microbiota composition with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative
colitis (UC) and to identify markers for future biomarker identification. We
conducted a prospective case-control study (EU-ref. no. 305676) in an inception
cohort of 324 individuals (64 CD, 84 UC, 116 symptomatic non-IBD controls and 44 
healthy controls) across five European centres and examined 54 predetermined
bacterial markers. We categorized patients according to the Montreal
Classification and calculated the dysbiosis index (DI). Non-parametric tests were
used to compare groups and the Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple
comparisons.
RESULTS: The fluorescent signals (FSSs) for Firmicutes and Eubacterium hallii
were lower in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) vs. symptomatic controls (p<.05). 
FSS for Firmicutes, Lachnospiraceae, Eubacterium hallii and Ruminococcus
albus/bromii were lower, whereas the signal for Bacteroides Fragilis was higher
in UC vs. symptomatic controls (p<.05). FSS was higher for Bifidobacterium spp., 
Eubacterium hallii, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes among patients with ulcerative 
proctitis, compared to extensive colitis (p<.05). In CD, we observed no
association with disease location. The DI correlated with faecal-calprotectin in 
both CD and in UC (p<.001). In terms of treatment escalation and anti-TNF
response, differences were observed for some bacterial markers, but none of these
associations were statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: Our data reveal that the GA-map™ Dysbiosis Test holds the potential
to characterize the faecal microbiota composition and to assess the degree of
dysbiosis in new-onset IBD. On the other hand, our results cannot demonstrate any
proven diagnostic or predictive value of this method to support clinical decision
making.
