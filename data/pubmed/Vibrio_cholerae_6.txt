Background and Objectives: Cholixin (cholix toxin) is a novel exotoxin in Vibrio 
cholerae identified as an elongation factor II specific ADP-ribosyltransferase
which inhibits protein synthesis in the eukaryotic cell. Previous researches have
suggested that cholixin probably is an important virulence factor in
non-O1/non-O139 V. cholerae (NAG) serotypes that could be related to
extra-intestinal rather than intestinal infections. This study was aimed to
investigate the frequency and genetic diversity of colixin gene (chxA) in
clinical V. cholerae NAG isolates.
Materials and Methods: The presence of chxA gene in 44 clinical V. cholerae NAG
isolates were screened using PCR through specific primers designed for the
receptor-binding domain (RBD) of chxA gene. The five PCR products of chxA gene
were sequenced.
Results: This study showed that chxA gene presented in 19 V. cholerae NAG
isolates. The sequences analysis of 5 out of 19 the partial chxA genes amplicon
showed that 4 of them belonged to chxA I and the other one belonged to chxA II
subtypes. Two distinct clusters were revealed for these isolates by phylogenic
analysis, too.
Conclusion: The chxA gene contained high frequency among V. cholerae NAG isolates
in Bushehr, Iran. The polymorphism study on RBD of cholixin gene is suggested as 
an appropriate method for phylogenic characterization of the various chxA gene
subtypes.
