BACKGROUND: In primary hyperoxaluria Type 1 (PH1), endogenous oxalate
overproduction significantly elevates urinary oxalate excretion, resulting in
recurrent urolithiasis and/or progressive nephrocalcinosis and often early
end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In ESRD, dialysis cannot sufficiently remove
oxalate; plasma oxalate (Pox) increases markedly, inducing systemic oxalate
deposition (oxalosis) and often death. Interventions to reduce Pox in PH1
subjects with ESRD could have significant clinical impact. This ongoing Phase II,
open-label trial aimed to evaluate whether long-term Oxabact™ (Oxalobacter
formigenes, OC5, OxThera Intellectual Property AB, Sweden) lowers Pox in PH1 ESRD
subjects, ameliorating clinical outcome.
METHODS: PH1 ESRD subjects on stable dialysis regimens were examined. Subjects
were administered one OC5 capsule twice daily for up to 36 months or until
transplantation. Total Pox values, cardiac function and safety were evaluated.
Free Pox was evaluated in a comparative non-treated PH1 dialysis group using
retrospective chart reviews and analyses.
RESULTS: Twelve subjects enrolled in an initial 6-week treatment phase. Following
a washout of up to 4 weeks, eight subjects entered a continuation study; outcomes
after 24 months of treatment are presented. After 24 months, all subjects had
reduced or non-elevated Pox compared with baseline. Cardiac function improved,
then stabilized. No treatment-related serious adverse events were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with an untreated natural control cohort, 24 months OC5
administration was beneficial to PH1 ESRD subjects by substantially decreasing
Pox concentrations, and improving or stabilizing cardiac function and clinical
status, without increasing dialysis frequency. OC5 was safe and well-tolerated.
