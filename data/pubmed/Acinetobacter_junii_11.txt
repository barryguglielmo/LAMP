The study aimed to evaluate biopolymer production using two bacterial strains,
Acinetobacter junii BP25 and Aeromonas hydrophila ATCC 7966, and their
co-culture. Batch experiments were evaluated using acetate and butyrate as carbon
sources in feast and famine strategy. Feast phase was studied using carbon,
nitrates and phosphate in the ratio of 100:8:1 and famine phase was limited with 
the phosphate and nitrates. Co-culture resulted in highest specific growth rate
(0.30 h-1) in the feast phase and the famine phase accounted the maximum
polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) accumulation (2.46 g PHB/L), followed by Acinetobacter 
junii BP25 (0.25 h-1 and 1.82 g PHB/L) and Aeromonas hydrophila ATCC 7966
(0.17 h-1 and 1.12 g PHB/L). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and 
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) structural analysis confirmed as
PHB. PHB production using the co-culture could be integrated with biohydrogen
process using volatile fatty acids (VFA) as a carbon source in the biorefinery
framework.
