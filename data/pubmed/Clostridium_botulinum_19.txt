CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Botulinum toxin is commonly used for cosmetic facial
rejuvenation and can result in pain at the injected site, bruising and
ecchymosis, erythema and oedema, headache, diplopia, blurred vision, focal facial
weakness. This study evaluates the impact of botulinum toxin on refractive error 
and binocular vision.
BACKGROUND: Botulinum toxin (trade name: Dysport) is a neurotoxic protein which
is made from a Gram-positive anaerobic bacterium known as Clostridium botulinum. 
In this study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of Dysport injection on refractive
error, near point of accommodation and convergence, and palpebral fissure height.
METHODS: Twenty-eight subjects were treated for facial wrinkles, using Dysport. A
500-unit vial of Dysport was diluted with 2.5 ml preserved normal saline, and
injected doses were 30 units for crow's feet, six units for lower eyelid
wrinkles, 25 to 50 units for glabellar lines (five points), and 20 to 40 for
forehead creases on four points. The refractive error, near point of
accommodation and convergence and palpebral fissure heights were assessed before 
and two weeks after injection.
RESULTS: The participants comprised 23 women and five men at a mean age of
53.51 ± 14.1 years. The means of the equivalent sphere before and after injection
were -0.07 ± 1.34 and -0.08 ± 1.35 (p = 0.36). The means of near point of
accommodation monocularly before and after injection were 29.75 ± 6.16 cm and
26.75 ± 6.00, respectively. The means of near point of convergence before and
after injection were 16.03 ± 5.27 cm and 15.55 ± 6.14, respectively (p = 0.30).
The means of palpebral fissure height before and after injection were
10.33 ± 1.69 mm and 10.20 ± 1.46 mm, respectively. The changes in equivalent
spherical refractive error, binocular near point of accommodation and convergence
were not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: Dysport injection for the correction of upper face animation lines,
if performed at the appropriate sites and the appropriate concentration, has no
significant impact on refractive error, near point of accommodation and
convergence, and palpebral fissure height.
