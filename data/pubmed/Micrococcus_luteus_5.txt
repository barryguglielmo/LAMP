In this study, we present a disposable and inexpensive paper-like gold
nanoparticle-embedded cellulose nanofibril substrate for the rapid enumeration of
Escherichia coli (E. coli) using surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)
mapping. A disposable SERS substrate was simply constructed by mixing CNF and
gold chloride solution at 120 °C in a water bath. The application of the
resulting substrate was carried out by enrichment and SERS detection of E. coli. 
To this end, the spherical gold nanoparticle-embedded cellulose nanofibril
substrate was used as a scavenger for E. coli. After the target bacteria E. coli 
were separated from the matrix via oriented antibodies, the sandwich assay
procedure was carried out using 5,5-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB)-coated
Au nanorod particles that acted as SERS mapping probes. The distribution density 
of DTNB was demonstrated visually using SERS mapping, and the assay was completed
in one hour. The correlation between the E. coli and SERS mapping signals was
found to be linear within the range of 15 cfu mL-1 to 1.5 × 105 cfu mL-1. The
limit of detection for the SERS mapping assay was determined to be 2 cfu mL-1.
The selectivity of the developed method was examined with Micrococcus luteus (M. 
luteus), Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis), and Enterobacter aerogenes (E.
aerogenes), which did not produce any significant response. Furthermore, the
developed method was evaluated for detecting E. coli in artificially contaminated
samples, and the results were compared with those of the plate-counting method.
