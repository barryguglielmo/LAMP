The present study was conducted to evaluate the antibacterial activity, in vitro 
and in vivo cytotoxicity, cell viability and safety of Eastern Medicine coded
medicinal formulation Eczegone comprising extracts of Azadirachta indica (Azin), 
Fumaria indica (Fuin), Sphaeranthus indicus (Spin) and Lawsonia inermis (Lain).
This work also evaluated antibacterial activity of Eczegone formulation having
above mentioned plants ethanolic extracts against different bacteria's by disk
diffusion method. In vitro toxicity of Eczegone formulation was investigated by
using human skin keratinocytes HaCaT cell line, crystal violet stained cells, and
methyl tetrazolium cytotoxicity (MTT) assay. In vivo acute oral and dermal
cytotoxicity was determined by using Swiss albino mice and albino rabbits,
respectively. The Eczegone formulation showed antibacterial activity against 3
gram negative bacteria including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus 
vulgaris and a gram positive Staphylococcus aureus. We didn't observe any toxic
effect of Eczegone formulation on the skin keratinocytes. Furthermore, the
Ezcegone formulation was non-irritant according to draize score (OECD TG404,
2002). After rigorous safety evaluation by in vitro and in vivo acute oral and
dermal toxicity analysis, we concluded that Eczegone formualtion possessses
antibacterial effects and is safe, non-toxic, non-irritant, and the drug would be
subjected for further biochemical and clinical studies.
