Infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after hematopoietic cell
transplantation (HCT). Gut microbiota (GM) composition and metabolites provide
colonization resistance against dominance of potential pathogens, and GM
dysbiosis following HCT can be deleterious to immune reconstitution. Little is
known about the composition, diversity, and evolution of GM communities in HCT
patients and their association with subsequent febrile neutropenia (FN) and
infection. Identification of markers before HCT that predict subsequent infection
could be useful in developing individualized antimicrobial strategies. Fecal
samples were collected prospectively from 33 HCT recipients at serial time
points: baseline, post-conditioning regimen, neutropenia onset, FN onset (if
present), and hematologic recovery. GM was assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing. FN
and major infections (ie, bloodstream infection, typhlitis, invasive fungal
infection, pneumonia, and Clostridium difficile enterocolitis) were identified.
Significant shifts in GM composition and diversity were observed during HCT, with
the largest alterations occurring after initiation of antibiotics. Loss of
diversity persisted without a return to baseline at hematologic recovery. GM in
patients with FN was enriched in Mogibacterium, Bacteroides fragilis, and
Parabacteroides distasonis, whereas increased abundance of Prevotella,
Ruminococcus, Dorea, Blautia, and Collinsella was observed in patients without
fever. A baseline protective GM profile (BPGMP) was predictive of protection from
major infection. The BPGMP was associated with subsequent major infections with
77% accuracy and an area under the curve of 79%, with sensitivity, specificity,
and positive and negative predictive values of 0.71, 0.91, 0.77, and 0.87,
respectively. Our data show that large shifts in GM composition occur early after
HCT, and differences in baseline GM composition are associated with the
development of subsequent major infections.
