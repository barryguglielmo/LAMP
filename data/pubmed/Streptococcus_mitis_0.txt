We sought to determine whether temporal changes in the lower airway microbiome
are associated with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in children.Using a
multicenter prospective study of children 31 days to 18 years requiring
mechanical ventilation (MV) support for >72 h, daily tracheal aspirates were
collected and analysed by sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. VAP was assessed using
2008 CDC pediatric criteria. The association between microbial factors and VAP
was evaluated using joint longitudinal time-to-event modelling, matched
case-control comparisons, and unsupervised clustering.Of 366 eligible subjects,
66 (15%) developed VAP at a median of 5 (IQR: 3-5) days post intubation. At
intubation, there was no difference in total bacterial load (TBL), but Shannon
diversity and the relative abundance of Streptococcus, Lactobacillales, and
Prevotella were lower for VAP subjects versus non-VAP subjects. However, higher
TBL on each sequential day was associated with a lower hazard (HR: 0.39; CI:
0.23, 0.64) for developing VAP, but sequential values of diversity were not
associated with VAP. Similar findings were observed from the matched analysis and
unsupervised clustering. The most common dominant VAP pathogens included
Prevotella species (19%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14%), and Streptococcus
mitis/pneumoniae (10%). Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma were also identified as
dominant organisms in several subjects.In mechanically ventilated children,
changes over time in microbial factors were marginally associated with VAP risk, 
although these changes were not suitable for predicting VAP in individual
patients. These findings suggest that focusing exclusively on pathogen burden may
not adequately inform VAP diagnosis.
