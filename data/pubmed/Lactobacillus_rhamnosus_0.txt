Human were given a lot of opportunities to ingest TiO2 NPs in the environment.
Children have low, sensitive intestinal tolerance, and they could be exposed to
higher levels of TiO2 NPs than adults. Few studies have been conducted on the
interaction between TiO2 NPs and juvenile intestine phase models. Thus, in this
work, weaning rats were orally exposed to TiO2 NPs for 7 and 14 days. Results
indicate that Ti accumulated in the intestine, liver, and feces. Inflammatory
infiltration damage was observed in the colonic epithelial tissue, and gut
microbiota fluctuated with a decreased abundance of Lactobacilli in feces. Oral
supplementation with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) lessened TiO2 NPs-induced
colonic inflammatory injury, which might due to downregulation of nuclear factor 
kappa-B (NF-κB). Meanwhile, LGG maintained normal intestinal microbiome
homeostasis, thereby improving TiO2 NPs-induced colon injury in juvenile rats.
Moreover, fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) experiment indicated possible TiO2
NPs-induced intestinal microbiota disorder led to colonic inflammation. Our works
suggested the urgent need for additional studies on the risk safety assessment,
mechanism, and prevention of juvenile health damage from exposure to TiO2 NPs.
