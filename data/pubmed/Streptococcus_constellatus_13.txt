Purpose: To describe a patient with Streptococcus constellatus-associated
Lemierre syndrome complicated by eventual cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) that
manifested as an isolated abducens nerve palsy.
Observations: A patient with a history of heavy alcohol use presented with
Lemierre syndrome caused by an odontogenic infection due to Streptococcus
constellatus. Despite initiation of intravenous antibiotics and eventual
eradication of her bacteremia, she developed an isolated abducens nerve palsy on 
hospital day 7 due to associated CST.
Conclusions and Importance: CST is a rare complication of odontogenic infection
and Lemierre syndrome. This case demonstrates the potential for primary
odontogenic infections to progress to life- and sight-threatening diseases. This 
case also illustrates the importance of considering uncommon pathogens as the
etiology of CST based on the suspected source of primary infection.
