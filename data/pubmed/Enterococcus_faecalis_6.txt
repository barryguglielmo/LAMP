Enterococcus faecalis is a gram-positive organism responsible for serious
infections in humans, but as with many bacterial pathogens, resistance has
rendered a number of commonly used antibiotics ineffective. Here, we report the
cryo-EM structure of the E. faecalis 70S ribosome to a global resolution of
2.8 Å. Structural differences are clustered in peripheral and solvent exposed
regions when compared with Escherichia coli, whereas functional centres,
including antibiotic binding sites, are similar to other bacterial ribosomes.
Comparison of intersubunit conformations among five classes obtained after
three-dimensional classification identifies several rotated states. Large
ribosomal subunit protein bL31, which forms intersubunit bridges to the small
ribosomal subunit, assumes different conformations in the five classes, revealing
how contacts to the small subunit are maintained throughout intersubunit
rotation. A tRNA observed in one of the five classes is positioned in a chimeric 
pe/E position in a rotated ribosomal state. The 70S ribosome structure of E.
faecalis now extends our knowledge of bacterial ribosome structures and may serve
as a basis for the development of novel antibiotic compounds effective against
this pathogen.
