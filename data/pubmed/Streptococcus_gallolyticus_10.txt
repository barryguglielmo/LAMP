OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to assess the characteristics and prognosis 
of pyogenic spondylodiscitis (PS) in patients with infective endocarditis (IE).
The secondary objectives were to assess the factors associated with occurrence of
PS.
METHODS: Prospective case-control bi-centre study of 1755 patients with definite 
IE with (n=150) or without (n=1605) PS. Clinical, microbiological and prognostic 
variables were recorded.
RESULTS: Patients with PS were older (mean age 69.7±18 vs 66.2±14; p=0.004) and
had more arterial hypertension (48% vs 34.5%; p<0.001) and autoimmune disease (5%
vs 2%; p=0.03) than patients without PS. The lumbar vertebrae were the most
frequently involved (84 patients, 66%), especially L4-L5. Neurological symptoms
were observed in 59% of patients. Enterococci and Streptococcus gallolyticus were
more frequent (24% vs 12% and 24% vs 11%; p<0001, respectively) in the PS group. 
The diagnosis of PS was based on contrast-enhanced MRI in 92 patients, bone CT in
88 patients and 18F-FDG PET/CT in 56 patients. In-hospital (16% vs 13.5%, p=0.38)
and 1-year (21% vs 22%, p=0.82) mortalities did not differ between patients with 
or without PS.
CONCLUSIONS: PS is a frequent complication of IE (8.5% of IE), is observed in
older hypertensive patients with enterococcal or S. gallolyticus IE, and has a
similar prognosis than other forms of IE. Since PS is associated with specific
management, multimodality imaging including MRI, CT and PET/CT should be used for
early diagnosis of this complication of endocarditis.
