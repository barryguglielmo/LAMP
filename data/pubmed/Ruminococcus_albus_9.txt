OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of
lysophospholipids (LPL) supplementation on rumen fermentation, degradability, and
microbial diversity in forage with high oil diet in an in vitro system.
METHODS: Four experimental treatments were used: i) annual ryegrass (CON), ii)
93% annual ryegrass +7% corn oil on a dry matter (DM) basis (OiL), iii) OiL with 
a low level (0.08% of dietary DM) of LPL (LLPL), and iv) OiL with a high level
(0.16% of dietary DM) of LPL (HLPL). An in vitro fermentation experiment was
performed using strained rumen fluid for 48 h incubations. In vitro DM
degradability (IVDMD), in vitro neutral detergent fiber degradability, pH,
ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), volatile fatty acid (VFA), and microbial diversity were
estimated.
RESULTS: There was no significant change in IVDMD, pH, NH3-N, and total VFA
production among treatments. The LPL supplementation significantly increased the 
proportion of butyrate and valerate (Linear effect [Lin], p = 0.004 and <0.001,
respectively). The LPL supplementation tended to increase the total bacteria in a
linear manner (p = 0.089). There were significant decreases in the relative
proportions of cellulolytic (Fibrobacter succinogenes and Ruminococcus albus) and
lipolytic (Anaerovibrio lipolytica and Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus) bacteria
with increasing levels of LPL supplementation (Lin, p = 0.028, 0.006, 0.003, and 
0.003, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The LPL supplementation had antimicrobial effects on several
cellulolytic and lipolytic bacteria, with no significant difference in nutrient
degradability (DM and neutral detergent fiber) and general bacterial counts,
suggesting that LPL supplementation might increase the enzymatic activity of
rumen bacteria. Therefore, LPL supplementation may be more effective as an
antimicrobial agent rather than as an emulsifier in the rumen.
