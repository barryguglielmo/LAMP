To advance the scientific understanding of bacteria-driven mercury (Hg)
transformation processes in natural environments, thermodynamics and kinetics of 
divalent mercury Hg(II) chemical speciation need to be understood. Based on Hg
LIII-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopic
information, combined with competitive ligand exchange (CLE) experiments, we
determined Hg(II) structures and thermodynamic constants for Hg(II) complexes
formed with thiol functional groups in bacterial cell membranes of two
extensively studied Hg(II) methylating bacteria: Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA and
Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ND132. The Hg EXAFS data suggest that 5% of the total
number of membranethiol functionalities (Mem-RStot = 380 ± 50 μmol g-1 C) are
situated closely enough to be involved in a 2-coordinated Hg(Mem-RS)2 structure
in Geobacter. The remaining 95% of Mem-RSH is involved in mixed-ligation
Hg(II)-complexes, combining either with low molecular mass (LMM) thiols like Cys,
Hg(Cys)(Mem-RS), or with neighboring O/N membrane functionalities, Hg(Mem-RSRO). 
We report log K values for the formation of the structures Hg(Mem-RS)2,
Hg(Cys)(Mem-RS), and Hg(Mem-RSRO) to be 39.1 ± 0.2, 38.1 ± 0.1, and 25.6 ± 0.1,
respectively, for Geobacter and 39.2 ± 0.2, 38.2 ± 0.1, and 25.7 ± 0.1,
respectively, for ND132. Combined with results obtained from previous studies
using the same methodology to determine chemical speciation of Hg(II) in the
presence of natural organic matter (NOM; Suwannee River DOM) and 15 LMM thiols,
an internally consistent thermodynamic data set is created, which we recommend to
be used in studies of Hg transformation processes in bacterium-NOM-LMM thiol
systems.
