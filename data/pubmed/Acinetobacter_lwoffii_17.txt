OBJECTIVE: Helicobacter pylori is associated with gastric inflammation,
precancerous gastric atrophy (GA) and intestinal metaplasia (IM). We aimed to
identify microbes that are associated with progressive inflammation, GA and IM
1 year after H. pylori eradication.
DESIGN: A total of 587 H. pylori-positive patients were randomised to receive H. 
pylori eradication therapy (295 patients) or placebo (292 patients). Bacterial
taxonomy was analysed on 404 gastric biopsy samples comprising 102 pairs before
and after 1 year H. pylori eradication and 100 pairs before and after 1 year
placebo by 16S rRNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Analysis of microbial sequences confirmed the eradication of H. pylori
in treated group after 1 year. Principal component analysis revealed distinct
microbial clusters reflected by increase in bacterial diversity (p<0.00001) after
H. pylori eradication. While microbial interactions remained largely unchanged
after placebo treatment, microbial co-occurrence was less in treated group.
Acinetobacter lwoffii, Streptococcus anginosus and Ralstonia were enriched while 
Roseburia and Sphingomonas were depleted in patients with persistent inflammation
1 year after H. pylori eradication. A distinct cluster of oral bacteria
comprising Peptostreptococcus, Streptococcus, Parvimonas, Prevotella, Rothia and 
Granulicatella were associated with emergence and persistence of GA and IM.
Probiotic Faecalibacterium praustznii was depleted in subjects who developed GA
following H. pylori eradication. Functional pathways including amino acid
metabolism and inositol phosphate metabolism were enriched while folate
biosynthesis and NOD-like receptor signalling decreased in atrophy/IM-associated 
gastric microbiota.
CONCLUSION: This study identified that gastric microbes contribute to the
progression of gastric carcinogenesis after H. pylori eradication.
