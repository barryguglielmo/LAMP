PURPOSE: To report the clinical presentation and management outcome of patients
with endophthalmitis caused by Enterococcus species and to report the
susceptibility profile of the isolates.
METHODS: Twenty-nine cases with culture-proven Enterococcus endophthalmitis from 
January 2005 to May 2018 underwent vitrectomy/vitreous biopsy, intravitreal
antibiotic with or without additional procedures. The undiluted vitreous was
subjected to microbiologic evaluation. A favorable anatomical outcome was defined
as preservation of the globe, absence of hypotony, attached retina, and absence
of active inflammation at the last visit. Favorable visual outcome was final
visual acuity ≥20/400.
RESULTS: There were 24 men (82.8%). Mean age at presentation was 32.89 ± 25.25
years (median 24 years). Inciting event was open globe injury in 18 (62%),
endogenous in 5 (17.24%), postcataract surgery in 3 (10.34%), postscleral
buckling in 2 (6.89%), and postkeratoplasty in 1 (3.44%). Enterococcus
casseliflavus was the commonest species isolated (14/29, 48.27%) followed by E.
faecalis (9/29, 31%). Susceptibility to vancomycin was seen in 27/29 isolates
(93%). Visual acuity was ≤20/400 in all eyes at presentation and ≥20/400 in 10/29
cases (34.48%) at final visit. Anatomical success was seen in 18/29 eyes (62%).
Corneal involvement was high at 24/29 eyes (82.75%).
CONCLUSION: Enterococcus is not an uncommon organism in the setting of
endophthalmitis after open globe injury. Resistance to vancomycin is rare.
Multidrug resistance pattern is restricted to E. faecalis. Visual outcome is poor
despite early and appropriate therapy due to inherent organism virulence.
