PURPOSE: Chronic gastritis is observed in almost half world population.
Traditional medications against chronic gastritis might produce adverse effects, 
so alternative nutritional strategies are needed to prevent the aggravation of
gastric mucosal damage. The aim of this study is to evaluate the protective
effect of the combination of wheat peptides and fucoidan (WPF) on adults
diagnosed with chronic superficial gastritis in a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled clinical trial.
METHODS: Participants were randomized to receive WPF (N = 53) or placebo (N = 53)
once daily for 45 days. Pathological grading of gastric mucosal damage was scored
using gastroscopy. Fecal samples were collected for the determination of
calprotectin, short chain fatty acids (SCFA) levels and metagenomics analysis.
Questionnaires for self-reported gastrointestinal discomforts, life quality and
food frequency were collected throughout the study.
RESULTS: WPF intervention reduced gastric mucosal damage in 70% subjects
(P < 0.001). Significantly less stomach pain (P < 0.001), belching (P = 0.028),
bloating (P < 0.001), acid reflux (P < 0.001), loss of appetite (P = 0.021),
increased food intake (P = 0.020), and promoted life quality (P = 0.014) were
reported in the WPF group. WPF intervention significantly decreased fecal
calprotectin level (P = 0.003) while slightly increased fecal SCFAs level
(P = 0.092). In addition, we found altered microbiota composition
post-intervention with increased Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum (P = 0.032),
Eubacterium siraeum (P = 0.036), Bacteroides intestinalis (P = 0.024) and
decreased Prevotella copri (P = 0.055).
CONCLUSIONS: WPF intervention could be utilized as a nutritional alternative to
mitigate the progression of chronic gastritis. Furthermore, WPF played an
important role in altering gut microbial profile and SCFA production, which might
benefit the lower gastrointestinal tract.
