Of all bacterial infectious diseases, infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis
poses one of the highest morbidity and mortality burdens on humans throughout the
world. Due to its speed and cost-efficiency, manual microscopy of
auramine-stained sputum smears remains a crucial first-line detection method.
However, it puts considerable workload on laboratory staff and suffers from a
limited sensitivity. Here we validate a scanning and analysis system that
combines fully-automated microscopy with deep-learning based image analysis.
After automated scanning, the system summarizes diagnosis-relevant image
information and presents it to the microbiologist in order to assist diagnosis.
We tested the benefit of the automated scanning and analysis system using 531
slides from routine workflow, of which 56 were from culture positive specimen.
Assistance by the scanning and analysis system allowed for a higher sensitivity
(40/56 positive slides detected) than manual microscopy (34/56 positive slides
detected), while greatly reducing manual slide-analysis time from a recommended
5-15 min to around 10 s per slide on average.
