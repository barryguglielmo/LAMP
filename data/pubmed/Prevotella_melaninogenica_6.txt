An 85-year-old cachectic man was found unconscious in his home. He had no
specific medical history. On arrival, he was in a deep coma and hypothermic
state. He had a soft mass the size of his fist in the right lower abdomen without
redness or heat. Truncal computed tomography revealed subcutaneous fluid
collection with gas formation. A test puncture for right lower abdominal
subcutaneous fluid collection revealed pus, so an open incision was performed,
with the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Unfortunately, the patient
died of sepsis-induced multiple organ failure. The results of abscess culture
later revealed Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Prevotella
melaninogenica. This is the first report of a cold abscess induced by mixed
bacteria.
