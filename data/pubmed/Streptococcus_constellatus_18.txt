Objectives: The aim of the study was to characterize phenotypically and
genotypically an uncommon mechanism of resistance to macrolides, lincosamides,
and streptogramins (MLS) in a Streptococcus milleri group clinical isolate.
Materials and Methods: The isolate UCN96 was recovered from an osteoradionecrosis
wound, and was identified using the matrix assisted laser desorption
ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and the partial
sequencing of the sodA gene. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing were carried
out by the disk diffusion method and minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs)
were determined by the broth microdilution technique. PCR screening was performed
for MLS resistance genes described in Gram-positive bacteria. Specific mutations 
in the ribosomal proteins L3-, L4-, and L22-encoding genes were also screened and
those in domain V of the 23S rRNA gene (rrl). The number of mutated copies of the
rrl gene was determined using amplification-refractory mutation system
quantitative-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. Results: The clinical
isolate UCN96 was unambiguously identified as Streptococcus constellatus. It was 
susceptible to all macrolides and lincosamides (ML) antibiotics except spiramycin
(MIC >256 mg/L) while it was also resistant to streptogramins. Screening for all 
acquired resistance genes was negative and no mutation was found in genes coding 
for L3, L4, and L22 ribosomal proteins. Of interest, a single mutation, A2062C
(according to Escherichia coli numbering), was detected in the domain V of 23S
rRNA. Conclusion: Mutations at the position 2062 of 23S rRNA have been detected
once in Streptococcus pneumoniae, and not yet in other Streptococcus spp. This
mechanism is very likely uncommon in Gram-positive bacteria because different
copies of 23S rRNA operons should be mutated for development of such a resistance
pattern.
