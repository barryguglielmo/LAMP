A clinical Leclercia adecarboxylata strain harboring the mcr-4.3 and bla IMP-4
genes was isolated from active rectal screening of carbapenem-resistant
Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) in a patient. The isolate was found to harbor seven
plasmids, including a 94,635 bp bla IMP-4-bearing IncN plasmid and a 9,782 bp
mcr-4.3-bearing ColE10-type plasmid. The isolate was susceptible to colistin
despite carrying the mcr-4.3 gene, suggesting that this MCR-4 variant may not be 
functional. Carriage of antibiotic resistance genes in human gut L.
adecarboxylata strain suggests that close surveillance of resistance strains in
the human gut flora should be included as a routine clinical practice to prevent 
occurrence of infections, especially among immunocompromised patients.
