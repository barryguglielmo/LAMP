Lactococcosis is a hyperacute hemorrhagic septicemia disease caused by
Lactococcus garvieae, which is an emerging pathogen in global fish farming.
Between 2016 and 2018, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) from five farms that
presented outbreaks were sampled as part of a Mexican surveillance program for
the detection of fish diseases. Fourteen L. garvieae isolates were recovered from
sampled fish, as confirmed by biochemical tests, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and
clinical and histological insights. The biochemical and protein profiles of the
isolates obtained were homogeneous. Repetitive extragenic palindromic-(REP)-and
enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence PCR (ERIC-PCR) analyses 
established weak genetic heterogeneity. Rainbow trout challenged with two of the 
isolates used at different bacterial concentrations (10-2 and 10-4 CFU/mL) showed
melanosis, and hemorrhages were observed in the fins, liver, kidney, and spleen. 
Isolates were obtained from all of the organs sampled, including from surviving
fish, as either pure or mixed cultures. The present study is the first to confirm
the presence of L. garvieae as the agent of severe lactococcosis outbreaks in the
two primary Mexican states for trout farming.
