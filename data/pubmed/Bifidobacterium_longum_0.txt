This study used bifidobacterial exopolysaccharides (EPSs) from the selected
strains of Bifidobacterium bifidum WBBI01 and WBIN03, Bifidobacterium breve
WBBR04, Bifidobacterium infantis WBAN07 and Bifidobacterium longum WBLO01 to
explore the EPSs regulatory effect on anaphylaxis in mice. First of all, allergy 
mouse models were established via subcutaneous injection followed by OVA gavage, 
and then the EPSs from the five Bifidobacteria were fed into the mice via
continuous gavage. Samples were taken from the mice periodically to determine the
changes of cytokine levels in serum, including those of IgE, IgG, IL-4, IL-5,
IL-13 and INF-γ. The test revealed that the EPSs from B. breve WBBR04 could
considerably relieve food allergy in the mouse models, but the effect of B.
infantis WBAN07 was unsatisfactory. Based on the above conclusions, the EPSs of
B. bifidum WBBR04 and WBIN03, B. breve WBBR04, and B. longum WBLO01 were
respectively incubated with the small intestine tissue sections of an allergic
mouse model. The resulting culture supernatants were then tested. Based on the
above, it can be concluded that EPS of B. breve WBBR04 can enhance the intestinal
barrier integrity by attaching themselves onto the inner walls of the small
intestine, hence effectively isolating the allergens and preventing food allergy.
