The spread of resistance to vancomycin and other last-resort drugs in
Enterococcus spp. remains of concern. In Italy, surveillance data for
enterococcal bloodstream isolates in humans are scant. The aim of our study was
to assess the incidence trends of bacteremias due to Enterococcus species and
their prevalence trends of antimicrobial resistance. We retrospectively included 
all consecutive not-duplicate Enterococcus species isolated from blood cultures, 
in patients from 11 Italian hospitals (2011-2017). Incidence was defined as the
number of isolates per 10,000 patient-days, while resistance prevalence was
defined as the number of resistant strains divided by the number of tested
strains. We included 4,858 isolates (59%, 36%, and 5% due to Enterococcus
faecalis, E. faecium, and other Enterococcus spp., respectively). Over the study 
period, the incidence of bacteremias due to E. faecalis (incidence rate ratio
[IRR]: 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-1.04, p = 0.008) and E. faecium
increased (IRR: 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01-1.05, p < 0.001) alongside with the whole
enterococcal bacteremias trend (IRR: 1.02, 95% CIs: 1.01-1.04, p = 0.002). A
progressive increase in vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VREfm) bacteremias was
observed. Resistance to tigecycline and linezolid was rarely reported. The
incidence of enterococcal bloodstream isolates is increasing in Italy, together
with the prevalence of VREfm. Resistance to linezolid, a cornerstone drug used in
the treatment of VRE bloodstream infection, remains negligible.
