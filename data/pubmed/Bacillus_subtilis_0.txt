Bacterial nanotubes are membranous structures that have been reported to function
as conduits between cells to exchange DNA, proteins, and nutrients. Here, we
investigate the morphology and formation of bacterial nanotubes using Bacillus
subtilis. We show that nanotube formation is associated with stress conditions,
and is highly sensitive to the cells' genetic background, growth phase, and
sample preparation methods. Remarkably, nanotubes appear to be extruded
exclusively from dying cells, likely as a result of biophysical forces. Their
emergence is extremely fast, occurring within seconds by cannibalizing the cell
membrane. Subsequent experiments reveal that cell-to-cell transfer of
non-conjugative plasmids depends strictly on the competence system of the cell,
and not on nanotube formation. Our study thus supports the notion that bacterial 
nanotubes are a post mortem phenomenon involved in cell disintegration, and are
unlikely to be involved in cytoplasmic content exchange between live cells.
