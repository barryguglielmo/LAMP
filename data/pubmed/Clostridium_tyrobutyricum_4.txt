Clostridium tyrobutyricum is well known as one of the main causative agents of
severe cheese spoilage. The metabolism of this anaerobic bacterium during
ripening leads to textural and sensory defects in cheese and consequential loss
of product value. The potential to induce cheese spoilage, however, may vary
among different strains of the same species. Therefore, a better understanding of
the intra-species diversity of C. tyrobutyricum may be of practical relevance for
the dairy industry. In the present study, we compared the ability of three typing
techniques to differentiate 95 C. tyrobutyricum strains on the subspecies level: 
(1) repetitive element palindromic PCR (rep-PCR) fingerprinting combined with
conventional agarose gel electrophoresis, (2) hexaplex-PCR followed by an
automated capillary electrophoresis and (3) matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) typing. MALDI-TOF MS
fingerprinting provided only moderate reproducibility and low discriminatory
power. Both PCR-based methods were highly reproducible and discriminative, with
hexaplex-PCR fingerprinting being slightly more discriminative than rep-PCR
typing. Overall, a high intra-species diversity was observed among the tested
strains, indicating that further investigations on the strain level may be of
interest.
