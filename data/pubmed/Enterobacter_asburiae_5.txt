"Cotton fever" is described as a self-limiting illness following "cotton
shooting," the practice of injecting residual drugs extracted from previously
used cotton filters. Cases of related Enterobacter agglomerans bacteremia have
been described. We report the first described case of cotton fever in a patient
resulting in Enterobacter asburiae endocarditis.
