The gut microbiome has been implicated in multiple human chronic gastrointestinal
(GI) disorders. Determining its mechanistic role in disease has been difficult
due to apparent disconnects between animal and human studies and lack of an
integrated multi-omics view of disease-specific physiological changes. We
integrated longitudinal multi-omics data from the gut microbiome, metabolome,
host epigenome, and transcriptome in the context of irritable bowel syndrome
(IBS) host physiology. We identified IBS subtype-specific and symptom-related
variation in microbial composition and function. A subset of identified changes
in microbial metabolites correspond to host physiological mechanisms that are
relevant to IBS. By integrating multiple data layers, we identified purine
metabolism as a novel host-microbial metabolic pathway in IBS with translational 
potential. Our study highlights the importance of longitudinal sampling and
integrating complementary multi-omics data to identify functional mechanisms that
can serve as therapeutic targets in a comprehensive treatment strategy for
chronic GI diseases. VIDEO ABSTRACT.
