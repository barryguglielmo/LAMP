BACKGROUND: Chilo suppressalis is a widespread rice pest that poses a major
threat to food security in China. This pest can develop resistance to Cry toxins 
from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), threatening the sustainable use of
insect-resistant transgenic Bt rice. However, the molecular basis for the
resistance mechanisms of C. suppressalis to Cry1C toxin remains unknown. This
study aimed to identify genes associated with the mechanism of Cry1C resistance
in C. suppressalis by comparing the midgut transcriptomic responses of resistant 
and susceptible C. suppressalis strains to Cry1C toxin and to provide information
for insect resistance management.
RESULTS: A C. suppressalis midgut transcriptome of 139,206 unigenes was de novo
assembled from 373 million Illumina HiSeq and Roche 454 clean reads. Comparative 
analysis identified 5328 significantly differentially expressed unigenes (DEGs)
between C. suppressalis Cry1C-resistant and -susceptible strains. DEGs encoding
Bt Cry toxin receptors, aminopeptidase-P like protein, the ABC subfamily and
alkaline phosphatase were downregulated, suggesting an association with C.
suppressalis Cry1C resistance. Additionally, Cry1C resistance in C. suppressalis 
may be related to changes in the transcription levels of enzymes involved in
hydrolysis, digestive, catalytic and detoxification processes.
CONCLUSION: Our study identified genes potentially involved in Cry1C resistance
in C. suppressalis by comparative transcriptome analysis. The assembled and
annotated transcriptome data provide valuable genomic resources for further study
of the molecular mechanisms of C. suppressalis resistance to Cry toxins.
