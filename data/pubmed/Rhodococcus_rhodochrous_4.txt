The bacterial isolates of genus Rhodococcus are best known for their significant 
biodegradation abilities. Here, we report the data related to draft genome
sequencing of Rhodococcus rhodochrous strain SPC17 isolated from sediments of
Lonar Lake. The de novo assembly of 1598096 Illumina's paired-end sequencing
reads resulted in 51 contigs for an overall genome assembly size of 4.98Mb. A
total of 4546 genes were predicted using the National Center for Biotechnology
Information- Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (NCBI-PGAP). RAST
server-based annotation of the Rhodococcus strain SPC17 genome resulted in a
total of 295 subsystems with 25% subsystem coverage. The data on the draft genome
shotgun project are accessible at NCBI-GenBank under the accession number
WUUR00000000. Our data resource will facilitate further molecular and genomic
studies of diverse hydrocarbon catabolizing genes present in Rhodococcus
rhodochrous strain SPC17.
