BACKGROUND: Whipple's disease (WD) is a rare multisystem infectious disorder that
is caused by the actinomycete Tropheryma whipplei. It presents with joint pain
followed by abdominal pain, diarrhea, malabsorption and finally failure to
thrive. Diagnosis requires tissue sampling and histology with periodic
acid-Schiff [PAS] staining. Thrombocytopenia associated with endocarditis
associated with WD has been reported twice.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 56 year old Caucasian male presented with years of steroid
treated joint pain and recent onset diarrhea, weight loss and abdominal pain.
Ultimately he was found to have a platelet count of 4000 with concomitant
endocarditis and embolic stroke. Small bowel biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of WD
approximately 1 year after his first visit. His platelets improved with
antibiotic treatment but he eventually expired 16 months after his initial
consult and 5 months after his definitive diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: WD can remain undiagnosed and untreated until late in the course of
the illness. A high index of suspicion is recognized as necessary for early
diagnosis to begin treatment. Critical thrombocytopenia associated with
endocarditis is a rare and potentially poor prognostic sign in late stage
Whipple's disease.
