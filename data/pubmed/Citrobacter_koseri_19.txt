A 60-year-old female had a frontal bone intraosseous meningioma resected 10 years
previously. On follow up CT head, an enlarging intraosseous frontal bone lesion
was noted. This was thought to be a recurrent frontal meningioma.
Intraooperatively, she was found to have an abscess deep to the cranioplasty.
