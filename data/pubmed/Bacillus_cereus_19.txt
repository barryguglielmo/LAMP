Since the 2000s, the major causes of acute gastroenteritis in children in Korea
have been identified by classifying the pathogens into viruses, bacteria, and
protozoa. For viruses, the detection rate is 20-30%, and norovirus is being
increasingly detected to account for the majority of viral gastroenteritis cases.
In addition, despite the dissemination of the rotavirus vaccine, many rotavirus
infections persist, and its seasonal distribution is changing. The detection rate
of bacterial pathogens is 3-20%, with Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp.
infections being the most common, while the incidences of Bacillus cereus and
Campylobacter spp. infections are gradually increasing. Owing to intermittent
outbreaks of gastroenteritis caused by individual bacteria as well as the inflow 
of causative bacteria, such as E. coli, Vibrio spp., and Campylobacter spp., from
overseas, continuous surveillance of and research into the characteristics and
serotypes of each bacterium are needed.
