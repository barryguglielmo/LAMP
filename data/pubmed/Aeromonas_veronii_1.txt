The present study investigated the effects of black mulberry (Morus nigra) syrup 
supplementation on growth performance, hematological, serum biochemical, innate
immune parameters, immune and antioxidant related gene expression responses, and 
disease resistance of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus. Five isonitrogenous
and isoenergetic diets were formulated to contain black mulberry syrup at levels 
of 0%, 0.75%, 1.5%, 2.0%, and 3.0%. Fish were fed experimental diets for 60 days.
Dietary black mulberry syrup increased activities of serum lysozyme,
myeloperoxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase, and increased the expression 
levels of immune-related genes (interleukin 1, beta, tumor necrosis factor,
immunoglobulin M, interferon gamma and heat shock protein 70) in the spleen and
antioxidant-related genes (superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione
peroxidase) in the liver of fish fed especially with 1.5%, 2.0%, and 3.0% black
mulberry syrup supplemented diets. Furthermore, at 2.0% incorporation level,
growth performance increased. The findings of the present study indicate that
Nile tilapia fed with diet containing 2.0% black mulberry might be adequate to
improve the growth performance, innate immune parameters, antioxidant related
gene expression responses, and disease resistance against Aeromonas veronii.
