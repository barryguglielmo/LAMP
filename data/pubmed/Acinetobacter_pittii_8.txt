A lab-scale study of Scenedesmus obliquus: Acinetobacter pittii (S. obliquus: A. 
pitti) partnership cultured in synthetic domestic wastewater was conducted to
evaluate the partnership performance for growth and removal of nutrients from
wastewater. To draw out the functional dependencies of this partnership measured 
the ammonia-nitrogen (NH4+-N), ortho-phosphate (PO43--P), soluble total
phosphorus (TP), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and have got the nutrient removal
rate of 85.90%, 91.50%, 73.75% and 100% respectively. The results showed that
their optimized partnership ratio is 2:1 for S. obliquus: A. pitti and, CO2 & O2 
exchanges in between was the more crucial parameters to shifting the best
nutrient removals performance and promoted biomass quantity.
