In light of the global antimicrobial-resistance crisis, there is an urgent need
for novel bacterial targets and antibiotics with novel modes of action. It has
been shown that Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase (LasB) and Clostridium
histolyticum (Hathewaya histolytica) collagenase (ColH) play a significant role
in the infection process and thereby represent promising antivirulence targets.
Here, we report novel N-aryl-3-mercaptosuccinimide inhibitors that target both
LasB and ColH, displaying potent activities in vitro and high selectivity for the
bacterial over human metalloproteases. Additionally, the inhibitors demonstrate
no signs of cytotoxicity against selected human cell lines and in a zebrafish
embryo toxicity model. Furthermore, the most active ColH inhibitor shows a
significant reduction of collagen degradation in an ex vivo pig-skin model.
