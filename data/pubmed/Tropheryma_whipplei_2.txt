BACKGROUND: Intestinal infections remain a major public health burden in
developing countries. Due to social, ecological, environmental, and cultural
conditions, Indigenous peoples in Colombia are at particularly high risk.
MATERIALS: 137 stool samples were analyzed by microscopy and real-time-Polymerase
Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), targeting protozoan parasites (Giardia intestinalis,
Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium spp., and Cyclospora cayetanensis),
bacteria (Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella spp., Shigella ssp./enteroinvasive E. 
coli (EIEC), Yersinia spp., enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), enteropathogenic E.
coli ( EPEC), enterotoxin-producing E. coli (ETEC), enteroaggregative E. coli
(EAEC), and Tropheryma whipplei), and helminths (Necator americanus,
Strongyloides stercoralis, Ascaris lumbricoides, Ancylostoma spp., Trichuris.
trichiura, Taenia spp., Hymenolepis nana, Enterobius vermicularis, and
Schistosoma spp.). Microscopy found additional cases of helminth infections.
RESULTS: At least one pathogen was detected in 93% of the samples. The overall
results revealed protozoa in 79%, helminths in 69%, and bacteria in 41%. G.
intestinalis (48%), Necator/hookworm (27%), and EAEC (68%) were the most common
in each group. Noteworthy, T. whipplei was positive in 7% and T. trichirua in 23%
of the samples. A significant association of one infection promoting the other
was determined for G. intestinalis and C. jejuni, helminth infections, and EIEC.
CONCLUSIONS: The results illustrate the high burden of gastrointestinal pathogens
among Indigenous peoples compared to other developing countries. Countermeasures 
are urgently required.
