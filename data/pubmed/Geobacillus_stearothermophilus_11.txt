INTRODUCTION: The ability of healthcare-associated infection pathogens to survive
on environmental surfaces is well known. Disinfection is employed to reduce or
remove these pathogens but disinfection failures still occur. One method with the
potential to improve disinfection efficacy is whole-room disinfection with
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).
AIM: To determine the influence of delivery system on the efficacy of
low-concentration H2O2 on common healthcare-associated infection pathogens.
METHODS: SanoStatic (electrostatic spray) was compared with SanoFog (fogging) in 
terms of performance for delivery of 5% H2O2 and trace silver ions for
disinfection. The bacterial test challenges were vancomycin-resistant
Enterobacterales (VRE), extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella
pneumoniae (ESBLK), carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE),
meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Clostridium difficile spores, 
Bacillus atropheus and Geobacillus stearothermophilus commercial spore strips.
FINDINGS: SanoFog and SanoStatic were effective when tested under the conditions 
of experimentation reported here. For VRE, ESBLK, CPE and MRSA, SanoFog and
SanoStatic were comparable in performance. For C. difficile we concluded the
following: SanoFog was most effective for disinfection of C. difficile spores
when compared to SanoStatic.
CONCLUSION: Whereas SanoFog and SanoStatic were effective against bacterial
cells, the current practice of using SanoFog and SanoStatic together would be
effective for disinfection of C. difficile spores based on investigations under
the conditions of experimentation reported here. The spore strips results were
not comparable to the results either for the vegetation cells (VRE, ESBLK, CPE,
and MRSA) or for C. difficile spores.
