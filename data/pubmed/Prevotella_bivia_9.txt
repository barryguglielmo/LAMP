Introduction: Prevotella bacilli are prevalent in the body as members of the
normal flora and in some cases they can be involved in infections throughout the 
body. Prevotella bivia is a member of a nonpigment group found in the resident
flora of the female genital tract and it is occasionally seen in the oral cavity.
Case report: We describe the very rare case of a 39-year-old woman with fulminant
generalized peritonitis secondary to purulent salpingitis caused by Prevotella
bivia.
Discussion: In most cases described in the literature, Prevotella bivia was mixed
with aerobes and caused bacterial vaginosis and pelvic inflammatory disease,
whereas in our case study Prevotella bivia was the only microbe that was
isolated. The infection was fulminant and caused generalized peritonitis. Rapid
and systemic infections typically occur in immunocompromised hosts, however our
patient was in good health condition and immunocompetent.
Conclusions: Prevotella bivia may cause rapid and systemic infections, even in
immunocompetent hosts. Multidisciplinary team management is mandatory in order to
estimate the optimal treatment regimen.
