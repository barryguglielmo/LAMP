Spore-forming Bacillus sp. has been extensively studied for their probiotic
properties. In this study, an acid-treated rice straw hydrolysate was used as
carbon source to produce the spores of Bacillus coagulans. The results showed
that this hydrolysate significantly improved the spore yield compared with other 
carbon sources such as glucose et al. Three significant medium components
including rice straw hydrolysate, MnSO4 and yeast extract were screened by
Plackett-Burman design (PBD). These significant variables were further optimized 
by response surface methodology (RSM). The optimal values of the medium
components were rice straw hydolysate of 27% (v/v), MnSO4 of 0.78 g l-1 and yeast
extract of 1.2 g l-1 . The optimized medium and RSM model for spore production
were validated in a 5L bioreactor. Overall, this sporulation medium containing
acid-treated rice straw hydrolysate has a potential to be used in the production 
of B. coagulans spores.
