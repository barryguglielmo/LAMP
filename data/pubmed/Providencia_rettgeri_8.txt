OBJECTIVES: The increasing trend of β-lactam resistance among Enterobacteriaceae 
is a worldwide problem. This study investigated isolates of the tribe Proteeae
(Proteus, Providencia and Morganella) causing intra-abdominal and urinary tract
infections from the worldwide Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance
Trends (SMART) collected from 2008-2011.
METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on isolates with an
ertapenem minimum inhibitory concentration >0.5mg/L or those phenotypically
producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs). ESBLs, AmpC β-lactamases and
carbapenemases were detected by multiplex PCR.
RESULTS: A total of 142 isolates, including Proteus mirabilis (n=121), Proteus
vulgaris (n=3), Providencia stuartii (n=5), Providencia rettgeri (n=6) and
Morganella morganii (n=7), were analysed. Proteus mirabilis was generally
susceptible to ertapenem (∼90%) compared with imipenem (≤25%). The most common
ESBLs were CTX-M types (n=64), followed by TEM (n=27) and SHV (n=7). CTX-M-1,
CTX-M-2 and CTX-M-15 were the dominant CTX-M-type ESBLs in P. mirabilis isolates.
CMY (n=14), which included CMY-2 (n=6), was the most common AmpC β-lactamase,
followed by DHA (n=6) and FOX (n=4). NDM (n=7), which included NDM-1 (n=4), was
the most common carbapenemase, followed by KPC (n=2). Isolates from
hospital-associated infections had more complicated β-lactamase combinations than
isolates from community-acquired infections.
CONCLUSION: The global emergence and spread of β-lactamase-producing Proteeae
isolates are major issues in tackling antimicrobial resistance. Continuous
monitoring of antimicrobial resistance trends and developing further resistance
surveillance are necessary.
