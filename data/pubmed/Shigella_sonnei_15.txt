Background: The investigation of volatile oils used in traditional medicine is
vital to enhance the quality of healthcare. This study is aimed at screening the 
antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of Micromeria fruticosa serpyllifolia
volatile oils from three different regions in Palestine (north, middle, and
south).
Methods: Volatile oils of three samples of M. fruticosa serpyllifolia were
extracted using the microwave-ultrasonic apparatus. The antioxidant activity of
the volatile oils was assessed by inhibition of DPPH free radical. The
antimicrobial activity was examined using the broth microdilution method.
Assessment of antifungal activity was achieved using the agar dilution method.
Results: Screening the biological activity of plant extracts revealed that the
sample from Ramallah (middle region) possessed the most potent antioxidant
activity with an IC50 value of 0.45 μg/mL. The three samples exhibited broad
antimicrobial activity and showed potential antifungal activity. The sample from 
the southern region showed the highest potency against Shigella sonnei with the
lowest reported MIC; the sample from the northern region demonstrated the least
potency against clinical isolate of Staphylococcus aureus and
"methicillin"-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Conclusions: The study showed that Micromeria fruticosa serpyllifolia volatile
oil samples from different regions in Palestine possess different potential
antioxidant and antimicrobial activities that were in line with traditional uses 
of the plant extracts.
