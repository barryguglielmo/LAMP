The 'first 1000 days of life' determine the gut microbiota composition and can
have long-term health consequences. In this study, the simulator of the human
intestinal microbial ecosystem (SHIME®) model, which represents the main
functional sections of the digestive tract, was chosen to study the microbiota of
young children. The aim of this study was to reproduce the digestive process of
toddlers and their specific colonic environment. The ascending, transverse and
descending colons of SHIME® model were inoculated with feces from three donors
aged between 1 and 2 years-old, in three separate runs. For each run, samples
from colon vessels were collected at days 14, 21 and 28 after microbiota
stabilization period. Short chain fatty acid concentrations determined by HPLC
showed that microbiota obtained in SHIME® model shared characteristics between
adults and infants. In addition, microbial diversity and bacterial populations
determined by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing were specific to each colon vessel. In
conclusion, the SHIME® model developed in this study seemed well adapted to
evaluate prebiotic and probiotic impact on the specific microbiota of toddlers,
or medicine and endocrine disruptor metabolism. Moreover, this study is the first
to highlight some biofilm development in in vitro gastrointestinal modelling
systems.
