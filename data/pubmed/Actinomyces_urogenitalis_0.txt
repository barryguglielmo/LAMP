A case of bacteremia with the fastidious bacteria Actinomyces urogenitalis
following lengthy urinary retention is reported in a sixty-year-old man. In 2013,
the first case of bacteremia due to A. urogenitalis was presented, secondary to a
tubo-ovarian abscess following transvaginal oocyte retrieval. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the first male bacteremic episode involving A. urogenitalis
related to a urinary tract focus. The patient had no prior urogenital medical
history. Extensive susceptibility testing was done on isolates from urinary and
blood cultures. The organism exhibited fluoroquinolone resistance but was
susceptible to most other antibiotics used in the treatment of urinary
infections. Due to its unusual growth requirements infections with
A. urogenitalis are most likely an underdiagnosed entity.
