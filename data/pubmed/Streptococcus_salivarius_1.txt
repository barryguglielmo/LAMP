Aim: The purpose of this study was to create an alternative protocol for the
DNA-based identification of salivary microbiota focused on the distinguishing of 
Streptococcus species. Materials & methods: Salivary bacteria were identified
using 16S rDNA sequencing and proteins and lipids profiling using MALDI-TOF/MS as
well as FTIR analysis. Results: Most of the isolates belonged to streptococci
- mostly the salivarious group indistinguishable by the molecular technique. In
turn, MALDI analysis allowed for their fast and reliable classification. Although
FTIR spectroscopy demonstrated the correct species classification, the spectra
interpretation was time consuming and complicated. Conclusion: MALDI-TOF/MS
demonstrated the biggest effectiveness in the identification and discrimination
between the salivary streptococci, which could be easily incorporated in the
workflow of routine microbiological laboratories.
