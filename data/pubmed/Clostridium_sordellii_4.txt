Enteric disease in horses may be caused by a variety of microorganisms, including
several clostridial species. Paeniclostridium sordellii (previously Clostridium
sordellii) has been frequently associated with gas gangrene in humans and several
animal species, including horses. However, its role in enteric diseases of
animals has not been fully determined. We describe herein 7 cases of enteric
disease in horses associated with P. sordellii infection. Grossly, the small
and/or large intestines were necrotic, hemorrhagic, and edematous.
Microscopically, there was severe mucosal necrosis and hemorrhage of the small
and/or large intestine of all horses. P. sordellii was isolated and/or
demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and/or PCR in the intestine of all horses.
All other known causes of enteric disease in horses were ruled out in these 7
cases. P. sordellii should be considered among the differential diagnoses in
cases of enteric disease in horses.
