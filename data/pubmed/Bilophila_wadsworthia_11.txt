Background: Long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) enables people living with HIV
(PLW-HIV) to be healthier and live longer; though they remain at greater risk of 
pneumonia and chronic lung disease than the general population. Lung microbial
dysbiosis has been shown to contribute to respiratory disease.
Methods: 16S-rRNA gene sequencing on the Miseq-platform and qPCR for typical
respiratory pathogens were performed on sputum samples collected from 64 PLW-HIV 
(median blood CD4 count 676 cells/μL) and 38 HIV-negative participants.
Finding: Richness and α-diversity as well as the relative-abundance (RA) of the
major taxa (RA>1%) were similar between both groups. In unweighted-Unifrac
ß-diversity, the samples from PLW-HIV showed greater diversity, in contrast to
the HIV negative samples which clustered together. Gut bacterial taxa such as
Bilophila and members of Enterobacteriaceae as well as pathogenic respiratory
taxa (Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas and Klebsiella) were significantly more
frequent in PLW-HIV and almost absent in the HIV-negative group. Carriage of
these taxa was correlated with the length of time between HIV diagnosis and
initiation of ART (Spearman-rho=0·279, p=0·028).
Interpretation: Although the core airway microbiome was indistinguishable between
PLW-HIV on effective ART and HIV-negative participants, PLW-HIV's respiratory
microbiome was enriched with potential respiratory pathogens and gut bacteria.
The observed differences in PLW-HIV may be due to HIV infection altering the
local lung microenvironment to be more permissive to harbour pathogenic bacteria 
that could contribute to respiratory comorbidities. Prompt start of ART for
PLW-HIV may reduce this risk.
