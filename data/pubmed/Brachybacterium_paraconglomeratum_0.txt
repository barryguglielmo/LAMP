Purpose: To present our findings in a case of delayed-onset postoperative
endophthalmitis caused by Brachybacterium paraconglomeratum, a rare organism.
Observations. A 57-year-old man presented with epiphora and photophobia 17 weeks 
after a routine cataract extraction with phacoemulsification and intraocular lens
implantation. Because endophthalmitis was suspected to be caused by a low-grade
pathogen or fungus, an anterior chamber tap was performed. However, both
multiplex PCR and culturing were negative. The patient was treated with topical
cefmenoxime, oral minocycline, and subconjunctival injection of vancomycin and
ceftazidime, but the intraocular inflammation increased. Then, the anterior
chamber was tapped again, and the second PCR amplification and direct sequencing 
which targeted Actinomycetes detected Brachybacterium paraconglomeratum, a rare
organism.
Conclusion: This is the first reported case of an ocular disorder caused by B.
paraconglomeratum. We recommend that B. paraconglomeratum be considered in cases 
of delayed-onset postcataract endophthalmitis.B. paraconglomeratum. We recommend 
that B. paraconglomeratum be considered in cases of delayed-onset postcataract
endophthalmitis.
