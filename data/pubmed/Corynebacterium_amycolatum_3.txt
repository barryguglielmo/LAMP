Gram positive rods seen on Gram's stain are often dismissed as skin commensal
organisms. Diphtheroids (Non-diphtherial Corynebacterium species), as they are
collectively called, are taken as harmless bystanders in a skin and soft tissue
infection (SSTI). However, emerging evidence has established virulence factors in
some of these species leading to various infections. Here, we describe a case of 
mastitis in a 43 year old female caused by Corynebacterium amycolatum. The
organism was seen as thick Gram positive rods on Gram stain and was isolated as a
pure growth on Blood agar. Identification was done on Vitek-2 and confirmed by
matrix assisted laser desorption-ionization - Time-offlight (MALDI-TOF). Patient 
was managed successfully with surgical excision and antibiotics.
