The common therapeutic indications of Portuguese Natural Mineral Waters (NMWs)
are primarily for respiratory, rheumatic and musculoskeletal systems. However,
these NMWs have been increasingly sought for dermatologic purposes. Opposing to
what is observed in the major European Thermal Centres, there are few scientific 
evidences supporting the use of Portuguese NMWs for clinical applications. The
aim of this study was to characterize the antimicrobial profile of individual
NMWs from the central region of Portugal and correlate the results with their
physicochemical characterization. An extensive multivariate analysis (principal
component analysis) was also performed to further investigate this possible
correlation. Six collection strains representing skin microbiota, namely
Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium amycolatum, Candida
albicans, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Cutibacterium acnes, were analysed, and 
their antimicrobial profile was determined using Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute M07-A10, M45-A2, M11-A6 and M27-A3 microdilution methods.
Different NMWs presented different antimicrobial profiles against the strains
used; the physicochemical composition of NMWs seemed to be correlated with the
different susceptibility profiles. Cutibacterium acnes showed a particularly high
susceptibility to all NMWs belonging sulphurous/bicarbonated/sodic ionic profile,
exhibiting microbial reductions up to 65%. However, due to the complex
physicochemical composition of each water an overall conclusion regarding the
effect of a specific ion on the growth of different microorganisms is yet to be
known.
