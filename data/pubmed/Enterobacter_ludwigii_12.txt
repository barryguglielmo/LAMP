To develop biofertilizers for rice in Afghanistan, 98 plant growth-promoting
rhizobacteria were isolated from rice plants and their morphological and
physiological characteristics, such as indole-3-acetic acid production, acetylene
reduction, phosphate and potassium solubilization, and siderophore production,
were evaluated. The genetic diversity of these bacteria was also analyzed based
on 16S rRNA gene sequences. Of 98 bacteria, 89.7% produced IAA, 54.0% exhibited
nitrogenase activity, and 40% showed phosphate solubilization and siderophore
production. Some isolates assigned to Pseudomonas (brassicacearum, chengduensis, 
plecoglossicida, resinovorans, and straminea) formed a relationship with rice,
and P. resinovorans and P. straminea showed nitrogen fixation. Rhizobium borbori 
and R. rosettiformans showed a relationship with rice plants and nitrogen
fixation. Among the isolates examined, AF134 and AF137 belonging to Enterobacter 
ludwigii and P. putida produced large amounts of IAA (92.3 Î¼g mL-1) and exhibited
high nitrogenase activity (647.4 nmol C2H4 h-1), respectively. In the plant
growth test, more than 70% of the inoculated isolates showed significantly
increased root and shoot dry weights. Highly diverse bacterial isolates showing
promising rice growth-promoting traits were obtained from Afghanistan alkaline
soils.
