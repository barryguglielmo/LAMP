VetPath is an ongoing pan-European antimicrobial susceptibility monitoring
programme collecting pathogens from diseased cattle, pigs and poultry not
recently treated with antibiotics. Non-duplicate isolates (n = 1244) were
obtained from cows with acute clinical mastitis in eight countries during
2015-2016 for centrally antimicrobial susceptibility testing according CLSI
standards. Among Escherichia coli (n = 225), resistance was high to ampicillin
and tetracycline, moderate to kanamycin and low to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid
and cefazolin. The MIC50/90 of danofloxacin, enrofloxacin and marbofloxacin were 
0.03 and 0.06 μg/mL. For Klebsiella spp. (n = 70), similar results were noted,
except for ampicillin and kanamycin. We detected 3.7 % (11/295)
Enterobacteriaceae isolates carrying an ESBL/AmpC gene. Staphylococcus aureus
(n = 247) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; n = 189) isolates were
susceptible to most antimicrobials tested except to penicillin (25.1 and 29.1 %
resistance). Two S. aureus and thirteen CoNS isolates harboured mecA gene.
Streptococcus uberis isolates (n = 208) were susceptible to β-lactam antibiotics 
(87.1-94.7 % susceptibility), 23.9 % were resistant to erythromycin and 37.5 % to
tetracycline. Resistance to pirlimycin was moderate. For Streptococcus
dysgalactiae (n = 132) the latter figures were 10.6 and 43.2 %; pirlimycin
resistance was low. MIC values for Streptococcus agalactiae, Trueperella pyogenes
and Corynebacterium spp. were generally low. This current VetPath study shows
that mastitis pathogens were susceptible to most antimicrobials with exceptions
of staphylococci against penicillin and streptococci against erythromycin or
tetracycline. For most antimicrobials, the percentage resistance and MIC50/90
values among the major pathogens were comparable to that of the preceeding
VetPath surveys. This work highlights the high need to set additional clinical
breakpoints for antimicrobials frequently used to treat mastitis.
