This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics, distribution of
different strains and risk factors of patients infected with Streptococcus
anginosus group (SAG). In the population of 463 patients, the male-to-female
ratio was 1.95:1, and the patient age ranged from 6 months to 103 years. There
were 49 children (10.58%), 311 young and middle-aged adults (67.17%), and 103
elderly adults (22.25%). Approximately 45.4% had underlying conditions, which
were mostly malignant tumors and diabetes. Of the 463 specimens, 254 were S.
anginosus (54.86%), 173 were S. constellatus (37.37%), and 36 were S. intermedius
(7.77%). According to the age distribution, the incidence peaked in the 35-54
year age group. Different sites of infection had statistically significant
differences regarding the constituent ratios of these three species. Different
age groups also exhibited statistically significant differences in constituent
ratios of the pathogenic organisms, as well as organ infections. In our
population, 269 were clinically cured, 184 reported satisfactory improvement, and
10 died. SAG, as an opportunistic pathogen, can induce pyogenic infections in
patients of all ages and shows no significant gender predilection in any age
group. The three pathogenic organisms had differences with respect to patient age
and infections of body sites.
