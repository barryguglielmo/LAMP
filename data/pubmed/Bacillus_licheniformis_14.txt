The antioxidant activity and cell viability of feather hydrolysates obtained with
the Bacillus licheniformis were evaluated using an in-vitro model. The results
indicate that feathers-derived peptides under 3 kDa have antioxidant activity
with IC50 values of 5.03 ± 0.215 mg/mL by using DPPH antioxidant assay. Although 
the antioxidant activity of the peptides under 3 kDa preserved after applying
diverse heating (from 20 to 100 °C), they lost their activity under strongly
acidic or alkaline conditions. Antioxidant activity of the mixed feather
bioactive peptides (MFBPs) obtained with partial purification of peptides under
3 kDa was with IC50 amount of 0.169 mg/mL ± 0.004 using DPPH radical scavenging
assay. Also, MFBPs within an amount range of from 0.0048 to 5.0 mg/mL,
illustrated no cytotoxicity to gingival fibroblast blood cell lines. In light of 
our results, the obtained value-added peptides could be useful in different food 
products as a future functional ingredient with antioxidant potency.
