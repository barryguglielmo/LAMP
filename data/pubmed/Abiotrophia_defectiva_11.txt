Infective endocarditis (IE) refers to an infection involving the endocardial
surface of the heart. Most of the cases of IE are known to occur due to infection
by viridans Streptococci or Staphylococci species. Abiotrophia defectiva is known
to cause less than 1% of cases of IE. Though rare, this organism can cause
life-threatening complications such as septic embolization, destruction of heart 
valves, and heart failure if not detected and treated timely. Here we discuss a
case of a 44-year-old female who presented to our tertiary care centre with
complaints of fever and easy fatiguability for two weeks. After further
investigations, she was finally diagnosed to have IE due to Abiotrophia
defectiva. Imaging demonstrated the presence of embolic and valvular
complications as well. Through this case, we highlight the importance of early
detection and timely management of this condition in order to decrease the
occurrence of fatal complications and mortality.
