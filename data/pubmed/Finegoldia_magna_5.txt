Necrotising fasciitis is a life-threatening condition characterised by
inflammation, affecting the soft tissues, which spreads within a fascial plane.
Skin changes can be delayed and can often go unnoticed. The condition arises from
a bacterial infection, commonly being of polymicrobial aetiology. We describe an 
uncommon case of necrotising fasciitis caused by Finegoldia magna, an anaerobic
coccus, in a 40-year-old patient with diabetes. F. magna is a Gram-positive
anaerobic coccus, which was previously known as Peptostreptococcus magnus The
bacteria is found in the normal flora of the urogenital tract. The bacteria is
associated with severe infections such as native valve endocarditis, paravalvular
abscess around a bioprosthetic valve, purulent pericarditis complicated by
mediastanitis, meningitis after pneumonia and necrotising pneumonia complicated
by pyopneumothorax. There have been no cases in the literature describing
necrotising fasciitis of the abdominal wall caused by F. magna.
