Raoultella ornithinolytica is a Gram-negative rod belonging to the
Enterobacteriaceae family and closely related to Klebsiella spp. It is commonly
present in aquatic environments. Human infections caused by R. ornithinolytica
are being increasingly recognized. It has been documented to cause various
hospital-acquired infections including but not limited to gastrointestinal, skin,
and genitourinary infections. The organism has been particularly associated with 
invasive procedures and is commonly seen in patients with malignancy, diabetes,
chronic kidney disease and immunodeficiency. To our knowledge, we report the
first case of pyogenic liver abscess caused by this organism. The patient
presented subtly with a chronic, nonresolving cough and was managed successfully 
by surgical drainage and appropriate antimicrobials.
