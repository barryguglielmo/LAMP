Bacillus subtilis SR1 is a metal resistant, polyaromatic hydrocarbon-degrading
bacterium isolated from petroleum contaminated sites. This study reports the
characteristics of the genome of the isolate containing one circular chromosome
(4,093,698 bp) annotated into 4155 genes and 4095 proteins. The genome analysis
confirmed the presence of multiple catabolic genes: aromatic ring-hydroxylating
dioxygenase (COG2146), aromatic ring hydroxylase (COG2368), catechol 2, 3
dioxygenase (COG2514), 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase (COG0043),
carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase (COG0599) responsible for the catabolism of
aromatic hydrocarbons along with the genes for biosurfactant production and
functional genes (czcD and cadA) for resistance to cadmium, zinc, and cobalt. Gas
Chromatography-Mass spectroscopy analysis revealed up to 35% in-vitro degradation
of benzo(a)pyrene after 21 days of growth along with the production of different 
intermediate metabolites. The pot trial analysis in the greenhouse condition
validated the rhizodegradation of BaP, which was significantly higher in the
presence of plant-microbe association (85%) than degradation in bulk soil (68%).
