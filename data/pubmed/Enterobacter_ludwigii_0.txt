We report a case of catheter associated bloodstream infection due to Enterobacter
ludwigii with a massive aggregation on the outside surface of a central venous
catheter (CVC). The 57 years old patient with a history of spondylodiscitis and
Staphylococcus aureus-associated endocarditis was admitted to the intensive care 
unit for acute cerebral infarction. The patient developed signs of infections and
the CVC was removed 11 days after placement. The infectious agent was identified 
by standard diagnostics to the genus level as belonging to the Enterobacter
cloacae complex, and additional molecular testing determined the species as E.
ludwigii. The catheter was selected for a study aiming to identify the influence 
of blood components on the formation of central venous catheter-associated
biofilms. In this course a massive biofilm was recognized and is presented here.
