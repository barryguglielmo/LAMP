Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) include species in the genera
Bacillus, Paenibacillus, and Pseudomonas We report here the draft genome
sequences of the strains Pseudomonas koreensis UASWS1668 and Bacillus megaterium 
UASWS1667, isolated from a horse chestnut tree, and Paenibacillus sp. strain
UASWS1643, isolated from a tomato stem. Auxin production and phosphate
solubilization were biochemically confirmed.
