We analyzed the incidence and the clinical and laboratory characteristics of
Staphylococcus lugdunensis urinary tract infections (UTIs) during a 10-year
period (2009-2018) and compared them with those of Staphylococcus saprophyticus
UTIs. A total of 38 and 162 episodes of S. lugdunensis and S. saprophyticus UTIs 
were observed. The number of S. saprophyticus UTIs was stable throughout the 10
years, whereas there was an obvious surge in the apparent number of S.
lugdunensis UTIs since 2014, coinciding with the commencement of a routine use of
MALDI-TOF MS. Univariate analysis showed that male sex (p < 0.001), advanced age 
(p < 0.001), hospital-acquired infections, (p < 0.001), upper UTI (p < 0.005),
polymicrobial infections (p < 0.05), hypertension (p < 0.001), solid-organ
malignancies (p < 0.001), renal stones (p < 0.001), urinary stricture (p < 0.05),
vesicoureteral reflux (p < 0.001), and presence of a urinary catheter (p < 0.001)
were significantly associated with S. lugdunensis UTI. Multivariable analysis
revealed that S. lugdunensis UTI was associated with male sex (OR = 6.08, p <
0.05), solid-organ malignancies (OR = 12.27, p < 0.01), and urological system
abnormalities (OR = 7.44, p < 0.05). There were significant differences in the
patient population affected and predisposing factors between S. lugdunensis and
S. saprophyticus UTIs.
