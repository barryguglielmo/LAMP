The scale-up of petroleum hydrocarbons-rich sludge (PHRS) bioremediation from
liquid medium to a composting method bioaugmentated with two indigenous bacteria,
capable of degrading high levels of crude oil, was surveyed. After isolating the 
strains (Sphingomonas olei strain KA1 and Acinetobacter radioresistens strain
KA2) and determining their biomass production, emulsification index (E24),
bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbon (BATH), and crude oil degradation in liquid
medium, they were inoculated into the composting experiments. In liquid medium,
the removal rate of crude oil were 67.25, 70.86, 61.77, 42.13, and 27.92%,
respectively for the initial oil levels of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5% after 7 days.
Degradation of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 g kg-1 concentrations of total petroleum
hydrocarbons (TPH) were also calculated to be 91.24, 87.23, 84.69, 74.08, and
60.14%, respectively after a composting duration of 12 weeks. The values of the
rate constants (k) and half-lives (t1/2) of petroleum hydrocarbons degradation
were 0.083-0.212 day-1 and 3.27-8.35 days for the first-order and 0.003-0.089 g
kg-1day-1 and 1.12-6.67 days for the second-order model, respectively. This study
verified the suitability of the isolated strains for PHRS bioremediation.
Successful scale-up of PHRS bioremediation from a liquid medium to a composting
process for degrading high amounts of TPH was also confirmed.
