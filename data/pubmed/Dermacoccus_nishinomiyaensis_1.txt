Dermacoccus nishinomiyaensis is a common bacterial resident of the human skin
microbiome, among other environments. D. nishinomiyaensis strain TSA37 was
isolated from the ash pan of a residential wood pellet stove. A genome assembly
of 3,130,592 bp was generated, with an N 50 value of 197,547 bp and a calculated 
G+C content of 69.01%.
