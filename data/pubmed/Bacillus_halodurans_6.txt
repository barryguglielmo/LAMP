Carbon-carbon bond formation is one of the most important reactions in
biocatalysis and organic chemistry. In nature, aldolases catalyze the reversible 
stereoselective aldol addition between two carbonyl compounds, making them
attractive catalysts for the synthesis of various chemicals. In this work, we
identified several 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate aldolases (DERAs) having
acetaldehyde condensation activity, which can be used for the biosynthesis of
(R)-1,3-butanediol (1,3BDO) in combination with aldo-keto reductases (AKRs).
Enzymatic screening of 20 purified DERAs revealed the presence of significant
acetaldehyde condensation activity in 12 of the enzymes, with the highest
activities in BH1352 from Bacillus halodurans, TM1559 from Thermotoga maritima,
and DeoC from Escherichia coli The crystal structures of BH1352 and TM1559 at
1.40-2.50 Å resolution are the first full-length DERA structures revealing the
presence of the C-terminal Tyr (Tyr224 in BH1352). The results from
structure-based site-directed mutagenesis of BH1352 indicated a key role for the 
catalytic Lys155 and other active-site residues in the 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate 
cleavage and acetaldehyde condensation reactions. These experiments also revealed
a 2.5-fold increase in acetaldehyde transformation to 1,3BDO (in combination with
AKR) in the BH1352 F160Y and F160Y/M173I variants. The replacement of the WT
BH1352 by the F160Y or F160Y/M173I variants in E. coli cells expressing the DERA 
+ AKR pathway increased the production of 1,3BDO from glucose five and six times,
respectively. Thus, our work provides detailed insights into the molecular
mechanisms of substrate selectivity and activity of DERAs and identifies two DERA
variants with enhanced activity for in vitro and in vivo 1,3BDO biosynthesis.
