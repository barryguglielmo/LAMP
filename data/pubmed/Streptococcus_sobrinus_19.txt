AIM: The aim was to investigate the salivary detection frequencies and quantities
of caries-associated bacteria from patients with orthodontic brackets.
METHODS: Patients wearing orthodontic brackets (n = 40, mean age = 26 years) and 
healthy controls without brackets (n = 40, mean age = 17 years) were enrolled in 
the study. Saliva samples from each patient was collected. After DNA
purification, target species comprising streptococci and a Lactobacillus species 
were detected and quantified from the samples using polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) and real-time quantitative PCR.
RESULTS: Detection frequencies did not differ between the orthodontic patients
and the control subjects for any target species except for Streptococcus
sobrinus, which showed significantly lower detection rates in orthodontic
patients (p < .05). Lactobacillus casei and Streptococcus gordonii were found at 
the highest detection frequencies with both species being detected in 38 (95%) of
the saliva samples of orthodontic patients. Similarly, L. casei and Streptococcus
salivarius were the species with highest detection frequencies (35, 87.5%) in the
control subjects. Real-time PCR revealed that Streptococcus mutans and S.
salivarius quantities were significantly higher in orthodontic patients than in
the control subjects (p < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Application of orthodontic brackets for 12 months leads to increased
salivary levels of cariogenic bacteria and may serve as a potential risk factor
for caries initiation.
