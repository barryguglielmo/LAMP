The inactivation and damage of histamine-forming bacterium, Morganella morganii, 
in phosphate buffer and tuna meat slurry by high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) alone
or in combination with 0.2% lemon essential oil (LEO) treatments were studied
using viability measurement and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). HHP alone or 
in combination with LEO treatments showed first-order destruction kinetics to
M. morganii during pressure holding period. The D values of M. morganii (200 to
600 MPa) in phosphate buffer ranged from 16.4 to 0.08 min, whereas those in tuna 
meat slurry ranged from 51.0 to 0.10 min, respectively. M. morganii in tuna meat 
slurry had higher D values and were more resistant to HHP treatments than in
phosphate buffer. In addition, the D values of HHP in combination with LEO
treatment were lower than those of HHP treatment alone at <400 MPa of pressure,
indicating that it is more effective to inactivate M. morganii under the same
pressure. The results showed the M. morganii at HHP in combination with LEO
treatment was more susceptible to pressure treatment alone. HHP with or without
LEO treatments can be used to inactivate M. morganii by causing disruption to
bacterial cell membrane and cell wall as demonstrated by SEM micrographs.
