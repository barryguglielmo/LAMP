Most of the probiotics Bacterial cells, express native antibacterial genes,
resulting in the production of, antimicrobial peptides, which have various
applications in biotechnology and drug development. But the identification of
antibacterial peptide, structural characterization of antimicrobial peptide and
prediction on mode of action. Regardless of the significance of protein
manufacturing, three individual factors are required for the production method:
gene expression, stabilization and specific peptide purification. Our protocol
describes a straightforward technique of detecting and characterizing particular 
extracellular peptides and enhancing the antimicrobial peptide expression we
optimized using low molecular weight peptides. This protocol can be used to
improve peptide detection and expression. The following are the benefits of this 
method, (DOI - https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.10.196 [1]). The data
briefly describe a simple method in detection identification, characterization of
antimicrobial extracellular peptide, predicating the mode of action of peptide in
targeting pathogens (In-silico method), brief method on profiling of
antimicrobial peptide and its mode of action [1]. Further the protocol can be
used to enhance the specific peptide expressions, detection of peptides. The
advantages of this technique are presented below:•Characterization protocol of
specific antimicrobial peptide•The folded antimicrobial peptide expression were
less expressed or non-expressed peptides.•Besides being low cost, less
time-consuming, easy to handle, universal and fast to execute, the suggested
technique can be used for multiple proteins expressed in probiotics
(Lactobacillus species) expression system.
