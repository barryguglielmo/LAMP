BACKGROUND: To report a case of enucleation caused by Streptococcus dysgalactiae 
endophthalmitis after traumatic corneal laceration.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 69-year-old man with history of retinal detachment treated
with vitrectomy and subsequent cataract surgery presented with traumatic corneal 
laceration while cutting grass. Appropriate repair of corneal laceration and
intravitreal antibiotics (vancomycin, ceftazidime) injection was performed. S.
dysgalactiae which was sensitive to the conventional antibiotics (Ampicillin,
Ceftriaxone, Levofloxacin, etc.) detected by aqueous culture. One day following
primary closure, the patient developed a complete hypopyon and vitreous
membranes. Despite vigorous systemic and intravitreal antibiotics administration 
with vitrectomy, endophthalmitis was not controlled and patient's ocular pain was
increased. The vitreous culture was also positive for S. dysgalactiae. Finally,
total enucleation was performed 9â€‰days after trauma due to fulminant
endophthalmitis with severe scleritis.
CONCLUSION: Progression of traumatic endophthalmitis associated with S.
dysgalactiae can be fulminant. Sufficient warning to patient about enucleation
and intensive care is needed in the case of this infection.
