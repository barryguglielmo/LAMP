Background: Cutibacterium acnes is the primary cause of shoulder surgery
infections, but the predisposition to larger skin counts and potentially higher
risk for postoperative infection remains unclear. This study aimed to quantify
risk factors influencing endogenous C. acnes burden and to compare counts among 4
shoulder sites.
Methods: C. acnes counts were quantified via a detergent scrub technique for 173 
participants. Bivariate and multivariable stepwise linear regression statistical 
analyses were used to investigate the association of sex, age, ethnicity, degree 
of hirsutism, diabetes, smoking status, body mass index, and location with
counts. A separate Wilcoxon rank-sum test was performed analyzing counts of
East/Southeast Asians vs. all other ethnicities.
Results: Sex, age, degree of hirsutism, diabetes, smoking status, and body mass
index were included in the multivariable stepwise linear regression analysis. The
multiple regression analysis isolated individuals <40 years with the highest
burden (P = .001). Males had a 191% increase in C. acnes counts compared with
females (P = .001). Increased hirsutism was further indicated to be a risk factor
for the male sex although not in a dose-dependent manner (P = .027). Wilcoxon
rank-sum test results found that East/Southeast Asians had the lowest load (P =
.019), although not significant in the multivariate model.
Conclusion: Surgical site C. acnes infections occur more frequently in younger
males, and males <40 years with shoulder-specific hirsutism have the highest
preoperative burden. East/Southeast Asians have lower raw counts of C. acnes
compared with other ethnicities that may be related to less hirsutism.
