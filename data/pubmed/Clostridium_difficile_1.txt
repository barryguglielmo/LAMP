Contaminated raw meat and meat products with Clostridioides difficile could be a 
vehicle to spread community-associated C. difficile infection. This study was
conducted to determine the occurrence of C. difficile in pork and poultry meat
samples (n=325) from retail establishments, and in edible giblet samples (n=36)
from a poultry processing plant in Murcia (southeastern Spain). Clostridioides
difficile, isolated from samples using selective enrichment prior to isolation on
a culture medium, was recovered from 2% (6/361) of the samples overall, all of
these being from the poultry processing plant. These isolates were recovered from
17% (6/36) of the edible chicken giblets, which includes 28% (5/18) of the
gizzard samples and 6% (1/18) of the liver samples tested. PCR testing of the six
C. difficile isolates were toxin A and B negative. These findings demonstrate the
survival of C. difficile in gastric acids of gizzards and its possible
transmission to other meat products. However, the very low prevalence of C.
difficile in the tested samples indicates that retail meat may not be an
important source of C. difficile transmission to humans.
