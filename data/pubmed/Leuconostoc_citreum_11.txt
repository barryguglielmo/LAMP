OBJECTIVE: Although the extracellular polysaccharides have been analyzed in the
previous period, the biochemical, enzymological characters and stimulation and
inhibition effect on glucansucrase are not fully understood.
RESULTS: After three steps purification, salting out, DEAE-Sepharose and Sephadex
G-75, the final specific activity was 264.84 U/mg protein with 4.31-fold. The
SDS-PAGE analysis of fraction gave a single band 170.35 kDa in the stained gel.
The active band was analyzed with LC-MS/MS to identify glucansucrase. The highest
coverage rate of dextransucrase from Leu. citreum (ACY92456.2) was 55.60%, the
results were speculated that the glucansucrase secreted from Leu. citreum B-2 may
be a novel glucansucrase. The purified enzyme was optimally active at 20-30 °C
and pH 6.0-8.0. Metal ions K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, and Cr+ had an apparent
stimulating effect on enzyme activity, especially in divalent ions Ca2+ and Mn2+,
the residual activities were higher than 200%. In a reverse, Hg+, acetonitrile,
SDS, salt, and guanidine expressed inhibition effect on enzyme residual activity.
The KM and Vmax were detected to be 4.82 mM and 0.97 U/mg, respectively.
CONCLUSION: All these data collectively indicate that B-2 glucansucrase is a
novel one, which have good properties and may applied to new food areas.
