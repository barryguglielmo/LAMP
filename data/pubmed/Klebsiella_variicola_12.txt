BACKGROUND: Excessive application of chemical fertilizer has exerted a great
threat to soil quality and the environment. The inoculation of plants with
plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) has emerged as a great prospect for
ecosystem recovery. The aim of this work to isolate PGPRs and highlights the
effect of bacterial inoculants on available N/P/K content in soil and on the
growth of wheat under conditions of reduced fertilizer application.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine PGPRs were isolated and tested for their growth-promoting
potential. Thirteen isolates had nitrogen fixation ability, of which N9
(Azotobacter chroococcum) had the highest acetylene reduction activity of
156.26 nmol/gh. Eleven isolates had efficient phosphate solubilizing ability, of 
which P5 (Klebsiella variicola) released the most available phosphorus in liquid 
medium (231.68 mg/L). Fifteen isolates had efficient potassium solubilizing
ability, of which K13 (Rhizobium larrymoorei) released the most available
potassium in liquid medium (224.66 mg/L). In culture medium supplemented with
tryptophan, P9 (Klebsiella pneumoniae) produced the greatest amount of IAA.
Inoculation with the bacterial combination K14 + 176 + P9 + N8 + P5 increased the
alkali-hydrolysed nitrogen, available phosphorus and available potassium in the
soil by 49.46, 99.51 and 19.38%, respectively, and enhanced the N, P, and K
content of wheat by 97.7, 96.4 and 42.1%, respectively. Moreover, reducing
fertilizer application by 25% did not decrease the available nitrogen,
phosphorus, and potassium in the soil and N/P/K content, plant height, and dry
weight of wheat.
CONCLUSIONS: The bacterial combination K14 + 176 + P9 + N8 + P5 is superior
candidates for biofertilizers that may reduce chemical fertilizer application
without influencing the normal growth of wheat.
