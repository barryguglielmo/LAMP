Although the microbiome has a potential role in gastric cancer (GC), little is
known about microbial dysbiosis and its functions. This study aimed to observe
the associations between the alterations in gastric microbial communities and GC 
risk. The study participants included 268 GC patients and 288 controls. The 16S
rRNA gene sequencing was performed to characterize the microbiome.
Streptococcus_NCVM and Prevotella melaninogenica species were highly enriched in 
cases and controls, respectively. Those who were in the third tertile of P.
melaninogenica showed a significantly decreased risk of GC in total (odds ratio
(OR): 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.38-0.96, p-trend = 0.071). Class
Bacilli was phylogenetically enriched in cases, while phylum Actinobacteria,
class Actinobacteria were related to the controls. The microbial dysbiosis index 
(MDI) was significantly higher for the cases compared with the healthy controls
in the female population (p = 0.002). Females in the third tertile of the MDI
showed a significantly increased risk of GC (OR: 2.66, 95% CI: 1.19-5.99, p-trend
= 0.017). Secondary bile acid synthesis and biosynthesis of ansamycins pathways
were highly abundant in cases and controls, respectively. Dysbiosis of gastric
microbial communities is associated with an increased risk of GC specifically in 
females.
