We present a rare case of a rapidly fulminant and destructive breast abscess with
gas production by the synergistic infection of Veillonella and Streptococcus
species. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of Veillonella
infection in the breast. Early recognition, empiric antibiotic cover, aggressive 
surgical debridement, and drainage are necessary to avoid systemic septicemia.
Staged reconstructive breast surgery allows for correction any resultant breast
deformity.
