Acinetobacter pittii is an important pathogen causing nosocomial infection
worldwide. In this study, a multidrug-resistant A. pittii ABC38 was used as host 
bacterium to isolate the lytic phage vB_ApiP_XC38. The biological characteristics
of vB_ApiP_XC38 were studied and the genome was sequenced and analyzed.
vB_ApiP_XC38 belonged to Podoviridae family. The phage had double-stranded
genome, which comprised 79,328 bp with 39.58% G+C content displaying very low
similarity (< 1% identity) with published genomes of other phages and bacteria. A
total of 97 open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted and contained nucleotide
metabolism and replication module, structural components module, and lysis
module. The ANI, AAI, and phylogenetic analysis indicated that all phages were
found distant from vB_ApiP_XC38. Altogether, morphological, genomics, and
phylogenetic analysis suggest that vB_ApiP_XC38 is more likely a novel phage of
A. pittii.
