n-Butyl acetate is an important food additive commonly produced via concentrated 
sulfuric acid catalysis or immobilized lipase catalysis of butanol and acetic
acid. Compared with chemical methods, an enzymatic approach is more
environmentally friendly; however, it incurs a higher cost due to lipase
production. In vivo biosynthesis via metabolic engineering offers an alternative 
to produce n-butyl acetate. This alternative combines substrate production
(butanol and acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA)), alcohol acyltransferase expression,
and esterification reaction in one reactor. The alcohol acyltransferase gene ATF1
from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was introduced into Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 
8052, enabling it to directly produce n-butyl acetate from glucose without lipase
addition. Extractants were compared and adapted to realize glucose fermentation
with in situ n-butyl acetate extraction. Finally, 5.57 g/L of butyl acetate was
produced from 38.2 g/L of glucose within 48 h, which is 665-fold higher than that
reported previously. This demonstrated the potential of such a metabolic approach
to produce n-butyl acetate from biomass.
