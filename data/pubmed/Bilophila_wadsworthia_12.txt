Tedizolid's anaerobic activity is unappreciated. In this study, it was active
against all 332 anaerobic isolates tested at ≤2 μg/ml except Bilophila
wadsworthia and was more active than linezolid against Bacteroides fragilis group
species (MIC90, 1 μg/ml versus 2 to 4 μg/ml). Tedizolid was active against
Gram-positive anaerobes (MIC90 for clostridia, 0.25 to 1 μg/ml; MIC90 for
anaerobic cocci, ≤0.06 to 0.25 μg/ml). Our data coupled with clinical reports
indicate that clinicians should consider its use in mixed infections where
Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobes are involved.
