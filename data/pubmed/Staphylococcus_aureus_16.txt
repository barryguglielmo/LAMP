OBJECTIVES: To appraise the epidemiological features of bacterial pneumonia and
its impact on lung suitability for donation in brain-dead patients managed with
protective ventilatory settings.
DESIGN: Retrospective observational study.
SETTING: Six ICUs from two university-affiliated hospitals.
PATIENTS: Brain-dead adult patients managed in the participating ICUs over a
4-year period.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among the 231 included patients, 145 (62.8%) were 
classified as ideal or extended-criteria potential lung donors at ICU admission
and the remaining 86 patients having baseline contraindication for donation.
Culture-proven aspiration pneumonia and early-onset ventilator-associated
pneumonia occurred in 54 patients (23.4%) and 15 patients (6.5%), respectively
(overall pneumonia incidence, 29.9%). Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacterales 
were the most common pathogens. Using mixed-effects Cox proportional hazard
models, age (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI [0.96-0.99]), anoxic brain
injury (3.55 [1.2-10.5]), aspiration (2.29 [1.22-4.29]), and not receiving
antimicrobial agents at day 1 (3.56 [1.94-6.53]) were identified as independent
predictors of pneumonia occurrence in the whole study population. Analyses
restricted to potential lung donors yielded similar results. Pneumonia was
associated with a postadmission decrease in the PaO2/FIO2 ratio and lower values 
at brain death, in the whole study population (estimated marginal mean, 294
[264-323] vs 365 [346-385] mm Hg in uninfected patients; p = 0.0005) as in
potential lung donors (299 [248-350] vs 379 [350-408] mm Hg; p = 0.04; linear
mixed models). Lungs were eventually retrieved in 31 patients (34.4%) among the
90 potential lung donors with at least one other organ harvested (pneumonia
prevalence in lung donors (9.7%) vs nondonors (49.2%); p = 0.0002).
CONCLUSIONS: Pneumonia occurs in one-third of brain-dead patients and appears as 
the main reason for lung nonharvesting in those presenting as potential lung
donors. The initiation of antimicrobial prophylaxis upon the first day of the ICU
stay in comatose patients with severe brain injury could enlarge the pool of
actual lung donors.
