Introduction: Treatment of Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) pneumonia is on concern
because resistance to amoxicillin is largely diffused. This study describes the
evolution of resistance to amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (AMC) in
Hi isolates and characteristics of patients with Hi severe pneumonia.
Methods: A monocentric retrospective observational study including patients from 
2008 to 2017 with severe pneumonia hospitalized in ICU. Evolution of amoxicillin 
and AMC susceptibility was showed. Characteristics of patients with Hi pneumonia 
were compared to characteristics of patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp)
pneumonia, as reference. Risk factors for amoxicillin resistance in Hi were
investigated.
Results: Overall, 113 patients with Hi and 132 with Sp pneumonia were included.
The percentages of AMC resistance among Hi strains decreased over the years (from
10% in 2008-2009 to 0% in 2016-2017) while resistance to amoxicillin remained
stable at 20%. Also, percentages of Sp resistant strains for amoxicillin
decreased over years (from 25% to 3%). Patients with Hi pneumonia experienced
higher prevalence of bronchitis (18% vs. 8%, p=0.02, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (43% vs. 30% p=0.03), HAP (18% vs. 7%, p=0.01,
ventilator-associated pneumonia (27% vs. 17%, p=0.04, and longer duration of
mechanical ventilation (8 days vs. 6 days, p=0.04) than patients with Sp
pneumonia. Patients with Sp pneumonia had more frequently local complications
than patients with Hi pneumonia (17% vs. 7%, p=0.03). De-escalation of
antibiotics was more frequent in patients with Sp than in patients with Hi (67%
vs. 53%, p=0.03). No risk factors were associated with amoxicillin resistance
among patients with Hi pneumonia.
Conclusions: Amoxicillin resistance was stable over time, but no risk factors
were detected. AMC resistance was extremely low, suggesting that AMC could be
used for empiric treatment of Hi pneumonia, as well as other molecules, namely,
cephalosporins. Patients with Hi pneumonia had more pulmonary comorbidities and
severe diseases than patients with Sp pneumonia.
