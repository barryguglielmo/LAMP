INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Changes in the composition of the gut microbiota in
patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) compatible with a contribution of the gut
microbiota in carcinogenesis have been reported. In particular, a decrease
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii has been identified. A CD4CD8αα, double-positive
lymphocyte population (DP8α) has recently been demonstrated in the human colon
and blood with regulatory functions and specificity for F. prausnitzii. Here, we 
aimed to detect dysbiosis in the fecal microbiome of patients with CRC by
metagenomic analysis, and to look for changes in the levels of DP8α circulating T
cells specific for F. prausnitzii in these patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with CRC and control subjects were prospectively
included. None had received antibiotics in the previous month or any anti-tumor
treatment. A stool sample was collected for each participant, and analyzed by
shotgun sequencing. The DP8α T cell population was identified and quantified on
fresh whole blood by flow cytometry with anti-CD45, anti-CD3, anti-CD4 and
anti-CD8α co-labeling.
RESULTS: Twenty-one patients with CRC and 20 controls subjects were included. We 
found that mean relative abundance of five species was significantly decreased in
CRC patients compared with controls, including F. prausnitzii, Barnesiella
intestinihominis, Alistipes finegoldii, Bacteroides eggerthii and Eubacterium
siraeum. We also found that the DP8α T cell population was significantly
decreased in the blood of CRC patients compared with controls.
CONCLUSION: In our work, we showed that a reduced abundance of F. prausnitzii in 
CRC patients was associated to a significant decrease in the circulating DP8α
Treg population, suggesting a potential involvement of reduced activity of DP8α T
cells in colonic carcinogenesis. These findings open new diagnostic and
therapeutic strategies for CRC.
