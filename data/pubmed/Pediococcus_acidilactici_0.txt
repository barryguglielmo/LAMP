Lignocellulose comprised of cellulose and hemicellulose is one of the most
abundant renewable feedstocks. Lactic acid bacteria have the ability to ferment
sugar derived from lignocellulose. In this study, Pediococcus acidilactici PA204 
is a lactic acid bacterium with a high tolerance of temperature and
high-efficiency utilization of xylose. We developed a fed-batch simultaneous
saccharification and fermentation (SSF) process at 37 Â°C (pH 6.0) using the 30
FPU (filter paper units)/g cellulase and 20 g/L corn steep powder in a 5 L
bioreactor to produce lactic acid (LA). The titer, yield, and productivity of LA 
produced from 12% (w/w) NaOH-pretreated and washed stover were 92.01 g/L, 0.77
g/g stover, and 1.28 g/L/h, respectively, and those from 15% NaOH-pretreated and 
washed stover were 104.11 g/L, 0.69 g/g stover, and 1.24 g/L/h, respectively.
This study develops a feasible fed-batch SSF process for LA production from corn 
stover and provides a promising candidate strain for high-titer and -yield
lignocellulose-derived LA production.
