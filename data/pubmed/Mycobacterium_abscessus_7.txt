The increase in drug-resistant Mycobacterium abscessus, which has become
resistant to existing standard-of-care agents, is a major concern, and new
antibacterial agents are strongly needed. In this study, we introduced etamycin
that showed an excellent activity against M. abscessus. We found that etamycin
significantly inhibited the growth of M. abscessus wild-type strain, three
subspecies, and clinical isolates in vitro and inhibited the growth of M.
abscessus that resides in macrophages without cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the in
vivo efficacy of etamycin in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) infection model was
greater than that of clarithromycin, which is recommended as the core agent for
treating M. abscessus infections. Thus, we concluded that etamycin is a potential
anti-M. abscessus candidate for further development as a clinical drug candidate.
