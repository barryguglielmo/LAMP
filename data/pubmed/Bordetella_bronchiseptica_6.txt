BACKGROUND: Bordetella bronchiseptica (Bb) infection commonly causes respiratory 
disease in dogs. Gentamicin delivered by aerosol maximizes local drug delivery
without systemic absorption but clinical response to protocols remains
undetermined.
OBJECTIVES: To compare the clinical response to 2 protocols of aerosolized
delivery of gentamicin in bordetellosis.
ANIMALS: Forty-six dogs with Bb infection confirmed by culture or quantitative
polymerase chain reaction on bronchoalveolar lavage.
METHODS: Retrospective study. Administration of aerosolized gentamicin for ≥10
minutes q12h for ≥3 weeks using 4 mg/kg diluted with saline (group 1) or
undiluted 5% solution (group 2). Clinical response firstly assessed after
3-4 weeks and treatment pursued by 3-weeks increments if cure not reached. Cure
defined as absence of cough persisting at least a week after treatment
interruption.
RESULTS: Demographic data were similar between both groups. Clinical cure at
3-4 weeks was more frequently observed with the use of undiluted solution (19/33 
vs 3/13 dogs, P = .03) in association with a shorter median duration of treatment
(4 vs 6 weeks, P = .01). Dogs from group 2 having less than 1000 cells/μL in
lavage were also more likely to be cured at 3-4 weeks than dogs with more than
1000 cells/μL [9/9 vs 10/19, P = .006] and median duration of treatment in that
subgroup of animals was reduced (3 vs 5 weeks, P = .02).
CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Aerosolized delivery of gentamicin seems
effective for inducing clinical cure in Bb infection. Clinical response appears
better using undiluted 5% solution, particularly in the subgroup of dogs having
less than 1000 cells/μL in lavage.
