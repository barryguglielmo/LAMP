CASE: We report a case of implant failure after primary 2-level M6-cervical disc 
replacement (M6-C; Spinal Kinetics) at C4-5 and C5-6. At revision surgery, a
full-thickness tear was identified in the sheath of the C5-6 implant. Histology
from periprosthetic tissue demonstrated polyethylene particles without acute
inflammation. Tissue cultures were positive for Propionibacterium acnes, but
ultrasonicate cultures were negative for both prostheses. An independent
laboratory test confirmed mechanical failure of the C5-6 prosthesis.
CONCLUSION: This is the first report of mechanical failure associated with
wear-debris osteolysis after M6-C disc arthroplasty. Therefore, continued
surveillance after CTDR is necessary.
