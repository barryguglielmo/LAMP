INTRODUCTION: Non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) can colonize the human body,
leading to opportunistic infection. This study was conducted to analyze the NTM
species composition in a primary hospital and investigate the potential features 
of the patients with different NTM species.
METHODOLOGY: Mycobacterial strains were collected from the patients admitted at
the hospital from January 2016 to May 2019. MPB64 assay was used to screen NTM
strains and confirmed by Rv0577 amplification. The species were identified by
hsp65 sequencing. The clinical records of patients with NTM were retrospectively 
reviewed.
RESULTS: Among the 122 identified NTM isolates, the most common strains were
Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC, n = 102, 83.6%), Mycobacterium abscessus (n =
9, 7.4%) and Mycobacterium lentiflavum (n = 5, 4.1%). The predominant species
among MAC were Mycobacterium chimaera (n = 57, 46.7%), followed by Mycobacterium 
intracellulare (n = 25, 20.5%) and Mycobacterium colombiense (n = 17, 13.9%). A
significantly lower percentage of positive acid-fast assay was observed in
Mycobacterium colombiense positive patients than in those with Mycobacterium
intracellulare and Mycobacterium chimaera. Mycobacterium intracellulare was more 
frequently isolated in patients from the infectious department than in other MAC 
members.
CONCLUSIONS: A predominant prevalence of Mycobacterium chimaera in Dongyang of
Zhejiang Province was different from other regions in China, indicating that its 
prevalence has been likely underestimated. The heterogeneity in clinical
features, caused by different MAC members, required an accurate species
identification of the NTM isolated in the primary hospitals.
