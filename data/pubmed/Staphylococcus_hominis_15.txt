BACKGROUND: The alarming spread of antimicrobial resistance requires the
development of novel anti-infective drugs. Despite the recent research focus on
the human microbiome and its likely value to understand and exploit
inter-bacterial inhibitory phenomena as a source for antimicrobial strategies,
the human microbiota has barely been investigated for the purpose of drug
development.
RESULTS: We performed a large screen analyzing over 3000 human skin isolates to
evaluate bacterial competition within the human skin microbiota as a basis for
the development of anti-infective therapeutics. We discovered a Staphylococcus
hominis strain with strong and broad activity against Gram-positive pathogens
that was mediated by the bacteriocin micrococcin P1 (MP1). In "probiotic"
approaches, this strain led to reduced Staphylococcus aureus infection and
accelerated closure of S. aureus-infected wounds. Furthermore, we used a
nanoparticle strategy to overcome the physico-chemical limitations often
encountered with natural substances such as MP1 and demonstrate a significant
reduction of S. aureus infection by MP1-loaded nanoparticles.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study gives examples of how analysis of bacterial interactions
in the human microbiota can be explored for the development of novel, effective
anti-infective strategies. Video Abstract.
