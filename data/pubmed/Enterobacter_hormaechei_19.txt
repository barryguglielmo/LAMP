Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) represent an urgent threat to human
health. Here we report the application of several complementary whole-genome
sequencing (WGS) technologies to characterise a hospital outbreak of blaIMP-4
carbapenemase-producing E. hormaechei. Using Illumina sequencing, we determined
that all outbreak strains were sequence type 90 (ST90) and near-identical.
Comparison to publicly available data linked all outbreak isolates to a 2013
isolate from the same ward, suggesting an environmental source in the hospital.
Using Pacific Biosciences sequencing, we resolved the complete context of the
blaIMP-4 gene on a large IncHI2 plasmid carried by all IMP-4-producing strains
across different hospitals. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of environmental
samples also found evidence of ST90 E. hormaechei and the IncHI2 plasmid within
the hospital plumbing. Finally, Oxford Nanopore sequencing rapidly resolved the
true relationship of subsequent isolates to the initial outbreak. Overall, our
strategic application of three WGS technologies provided an in-depth analysis of 
the outbreak.
