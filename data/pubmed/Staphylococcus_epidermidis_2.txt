Nanomedicine has seen a significant rise in the development of new research tools
and clinically functional devices. In this regard, significant advances and new
commercial applications are expected in the pharmaceutical and orthopedic
industries. For advanced orthopedic implant technologies, appropriate nanoscale
surface modifications are highly effective strategies and are widely studied in
the literature for improving implant performance. It is well-established that
implants with nanotubular surfaces show a drastic improvement in new bone
creation and gene expression compared to implants without nanotopography.
Nevertheless, the scientific and clinical understanding of mixed oxide nanotubes 
(MONs) and their potential applications, especially in biomedical applications
are still in the early stages of development. This review aims to establish a
credible platform for the current and future roles of MONs in nanomedicine,
particularly in advanced orthopedic implants. We first introduce the concept of
MONs and then discuss the preparation strategies. This is followed by a review of
the recent advancement of MONs in biomedical applications, including
mineralization abilities, biocompatibility, antibacterial activity, cell culture,
and animal testing, as well as clinical possibilities. To conclude, we propose
that the combination of nanotubular surface modification with incorporating
sensor allows clinicians to precisely record patient data as a critical
contributor to evidence-based medicine.
