AIM/PURPOSE OF STUDY: It is estimated that around 15 million babies are born
prematurely every year and approximately one million children die each year due
to complications of preterm birth (PTB). Many survivors face a lifetime of
disability, including learning disabilities and visual and hearing problems. The 
current study aimed to characterize Lactobacillus species isolated from vaginal
swabs and determine their antibiotic susceptibility.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 40 term and 20 preterm samples were processed by culturing 
on MRS agar and initial identification was carried out using sugar fermentation
reactions and 16S rRNA PCR. Moreover, Lactobacillus species from preterm and term
cases using paired samples, i.e. vaginal swabs and placenta tissues from 8
preterm delivering mothers were further recruited for metagenomics study to
possibly detect uncultured Lactobacillus species known to cause PTB.
RESULTS: 40% samples from preterm delivering mothers lack any Lactobacillus
species whereas in contrast vaginal microflora of all term delivering mothers
carry one or more species of Lactobacillus. L. crispatus (46% in term group and
25% preterm group) was found to be the most abundant group followed by L.
jensenii (25% in both groups) and L. gasseri (19% in term group and 10% in
preterm group). The antimicrobial susceptibility profile suggests that preterm
isolates were least resistant to linezolid (20% resistance rate) and
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (22% resistant rate) compared to term isolates
(>60% for each drug group). Furthermore, the metagenomics data for paired samples
(8 VS and 8 PT) from extreme PTB suggested that Lactobacillus Iners was the main 
difference between term and preterm deliveries. Moreover, overall lack of
lactobacillus species or presence of rogue Lactobacillus species such as L. iners
and L. vaginilis is associated with PTB. ERIC-PCR analysis using Lactobacillus
crispatus revealed that all the pre-term samples are closely related and fall in 
same cluster while all the term samples fall in different cluster.
CONCLUSION: The study not only provides a baseline data of distinct signatures of
associated lactobacillus species with the PTB which may be further transmitted to
new born infants but also developing further therapeutic interventions to better 
manage the PTB.
