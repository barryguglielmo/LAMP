BACKGROUND: In France, no previous studies have focused specifically on health
problems among medical students during internships abroad including the clinical 
symptoms suggestive of infectious diseases and the acquisition of pathogen
carriage.
METHODS: Clinical follow up and qPCR based respiratory, gastrointestinal and
vaginal pathogen carriage before and after travel were prospectively assessed in 
a cohort of medical students departing from Marseille, France.
RESULTS: 134 students were included. 73.9%, 38.8% and 5.0% of students reported
gastrointestinal, respiratory and vaginal symptoms, respectively. The acquisition
rate of Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) and Enteropathogenic E. coli
(EPEC) was 53% and 41%, respectively. The acquisition of respiratory viruses was 
low but associated with persisting symptoms, while bacterial acquisition ranged
from 3.3% for Streptococcus pyogenes to 15.0% for Haemophilus influenzae.
Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae acquisition rates were 7.7% and 14.3%
respectively. Five students (5.1%) had molecular quantification criteria for
bacterial vaginosis on return.
CONCLUSION: This preliminary study demonstrates that besides the known risk of
gastrointestinal and respiratory infections and associated changes in intestinal 
and respiratory microbiota, medical students abroad may also experience changes
in vaginal microbiota leading, in some cases, to clinical symptoms or the
acquisition of bacterial vaginosis, which may be asymptomatic.
