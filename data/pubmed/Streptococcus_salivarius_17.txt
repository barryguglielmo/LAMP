The probiotic market is increasing world-wide as well as the number of products
marketed as probiotics. Among the latter, many products contain Streptococcus
thermophilus strains at several dosages. However, the scientific evidence that
should support the probiotic status of those S. thermophilus strains is often
contradictory. This review analyses the scientific literature aimed to assess the
ability of S. thermophilus strains to survive the human gastrointestinal tract by
discussing the scientific validity of the methods applied for the bacterial
recovery and identification from stool samples. This review highlights that in
most of the intervention studies reviewed, the identification of S. thermophilus 
strains from stools was not carried out with the necessary taxonomic accuracy to 
avoid their misidentification with Streptococcus salivarius, a common human
commensal and a species phylogenetically close to S. thermophilus. Moreover, this
review highlights how critical the accurate taxonomic identification of S.
thermophilus in metagenomics-based studies can be.
