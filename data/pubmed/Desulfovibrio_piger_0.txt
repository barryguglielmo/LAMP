A comparative study of the kinetic characteristics (specific activity, initial
and maximum rate, and affinity for substrates) of key enzymes of assimilatory
sulfate reduction (APS reductase and dissimilatory sulfite reductase) in
cell-free extracts of sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) from various biotopes was 
performed. The material for the study represented different strains of SRB from
various ecotopes. Microbiological (isolation and cultivation), biochemical (free 
cell extract preparation) and chemical (enzyme activity determination) methods
served in defining kinetic characteristics of SRB enzymes. The determined
affinity data for substrates (i.e., sulfite) were 10&nbsp;times higher for SRB
strains isolated from environmental (soil) ecotopes than for strains from the
human intestine. The maximum rate of APS reductase reached 0.282-0.862
µmol/min×mg-1 of protein that is only 10 to 28% higher than similar initial
values. The maximum rate of sulfite reductase for corrosive relevant collection
strains and SRB strains isolated from heating systems were increased by 3 to 10
times. A completely different picture was found for the intestinal SRB Vmax in
the strains Desulfovibrio piger Vib-7 (0.67 µmol/min × mg-1 protein) and
Desulfomicrobium orale Rod-9 (0.45 µmol/min × mg-1 protein). The determinant in
the cluster distribution of SRB strains is the activity of the terminal enzyme of
dissimilatory sulfate reduction-sulfite reductase, but not APS reductase. The
data obtained from the activity of sulfate reduction enzymes indicated the
adaptive plasticity of SRB strains that is manifested in the change in enzymatic 
activity.
