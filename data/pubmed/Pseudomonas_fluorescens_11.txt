OBJECTIVES: Chiral 2-hydroxycarboxylic acids and 2-hydroxycarboxamides are
valuable synthons for the chemical industry.
RESULTS: The biocatalytic syntheses of (R)-mandelic acid and (R)-mandelic acid
amide by recombinant Escherichia coli clones were studied. Strains were
constructed which simultaneously expressed a (R)-specific oxynitrilase
(hydroxynitrile lyase) from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana together with the
arylacetonitrilase from the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens EBC191. In
addition, recombinant strains were constructed which expressed a previously
described acid tolerant variant of the oxynitrilase and an amide forming variant 
of the nitrilase. The whole cell catalysts which simultaneously expressed the
(R)-specific oxynitrilase and the wild-type nitrilase transformed in slightly
acidic buffer systems benzaldehyde plus cyanide preferentially to (R)-mandelic
acid with ee-values > 95%. The combination of the (R)-specific oxynitrilase with 
the amide forming nitrilase variant gave whole cell catalysts which converted at 
pH-values ≤ pH 5 benzaldehyde plus cyanide with a high degree of
enantioselectivity (ee > 90%) to (R)-mandelic acid amide. The acid and the amide 
forming catalysts also converted chlorinated benzaldehydes with cyanide to
chlorinated mandelic acid or chlorinated mandelic acid amides.
CONCLUSIONS: Efficient systems for the biocatalytic production of
(R)-2-hydroxycarboxylic acids and (R)-2-hydroxycarboxamides were generated.
