More than 3,000 isolates of fluorescent pseudomonads have been collected from
plant roots in Japan and screened for the presence of antibiotic-synthesizing
genes. In total, 927 hydrogen cyanide (HCN)-, 47 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol
(PHL)-, 6 pyoluteorin (PLT)-, 14 pyrrolnitrin (PRN)-, and 8 phenazine
(PHZ)-producing isolates have been detected. A cluster analysis (â‰¥99% identity)
identified 10 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in antibiotic biosynthesis
gene-possessing pseudomonads. OTU HLR (PHL, PLT, and PRN) contained four
antibiotics: HCN, PHL, PLT, and PRN, while OTU RZ (PRN and PHZ) contained three: 
HCN, PRN, and PHZ. OTU H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, and H7 (PHL1-7) contained two
antibiotics: HCN and PHL, while OTU H8 (PHL8) contained one: PHL. Isolates
belonging to OTU HLR and RZ suppressed damping-off disease in cabbage seedlings
caused by Rhizoctonia solani. Effective strains belonging to OTU HLR and RZ were 
related to Pseudomonas protegens and Pseudomonas chlororaphis, respectively.
Antibiotic biosynthesis gene-possessing fluorescent pseudomonads are distributed 
among different geographical sites in Japan and plant species.
