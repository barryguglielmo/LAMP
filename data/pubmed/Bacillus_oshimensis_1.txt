Genome-based reclassification of Bacillus plakortidis Borchert et al. 2007 and
Bacillus lehensis Ghosh et al. 2007 as a later heterotypic synonym of Bacillus
oshimensis Yumoto et al. 2005; Bacillus rhizosphaerae Madhaiyan et al. 2011 as a 
later heterotypic synonym of Bacillus clausii Nielsen et al. 1995.

In the present study, phylogenetic and genome-based comparison was carried out to
clarify the taxonomic positions of alkaliphilic Bacillus species, Bacillus
plakortidis, Bacillus lehensis, Bacillus oshimensis, Bacillus rhizosphaerae and
Bacillus clausii. Phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA gene sequences and
concatenated protein marker genes were constructed. Average nucleotide identity
(ANI) values were calculated to compare genetic relatedness. In phylogenetic
trees, B. plakortidis DSM 19153T, B. lehensis DSM 19099T, and B. oshimensis DSM
18940T; B. rhizosphaerae DSM 21911T and B. clausii DSM 8716T clade together. The 
average nucleotide identity (ANI) values between B. oshimensis DSM 18940T, B.
plakortidis DSM 19153T and B. lehensis DSM 19099T ranged from 98.7-98.8%, while
the ANI values between B. rhizosphaerae DSM 21911T and B. clausii DSM 8716T were 
95.2-95.5%. The ANI values were higher than the recognized threshold value for
bacterial species delineation. Based on phylogenetic and genome comparison we
propose reclassification of B. plakortidis and B. lehensis as a later heterotypic
synonym of B. oshimensis; B. rhizosphaerae as a later heterotypic synonym of B.
clausii.
