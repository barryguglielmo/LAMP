Most cervical cancer (CxCa) are related to persistent infection with high-risk
human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) in the cervical mucosa, suggesting that an
induction of mucosal cell-mediated immunity against HR-HPV oncoproteins can be a 
promising strategy to fight HPV-associated CxCa. From this perspective, many
pre-clinical and clinical trials have proved the potential of lactic acid
bacteria (LAB) genetically modified to deliver recombinant antigens to induce
mucosal, humoral and cellular immunity in the host. Altogether, the outcomes of
these studies suggest that there are several key factors to consider that may
offer guidance on improvement protein yield and improving immune response.
Overall, these findings showed that oral LAB-based mucosal HPV vaccines
expressing inducible surface-anchored antigens display a higher potential to
induce particularly specific systemic and mucosal cytotoxic cellular immune
responses. In this review, we describe all LAB-based HPV vaccine investigations
by reviewing databases from international studies between 2000 and 2020. Our aim 
is to promote the therapeutic HPV vaccines knowledge and to complete the gaps in 
this field to empower scientists worldwide to make proper decisions regarding the
best strategies for the development of therapeutic HPV vaccines.
