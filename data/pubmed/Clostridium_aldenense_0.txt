The influence of dairy on the gut microbiome has not been studied extensively. We
performed a randomized cross-over study to analyze the effect of high dairy
intake on the gut microbiome. Subjects were randomly assigned to a high-dairy
diet (HDD) (5-6 dairy portions per day) and a low-dairy diet (LDD) (â‰¤1 dairy
portion per day) for 6 weeks with a washout period of 4 weeks in between both
diets. The gut microbiome was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
Compositionality and functionality of the gut microbiome was assessed using
Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) and Phylogenetic
Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt).
Stool consistency was evaluated using the Bristol stool chart. In total, 46
healthy overweight subjects (BMI range 25-30 kg/m2) completed both intervention
periods. During the HDD, there was a significantly higher abundance of the genera
Streptococcus, Leuconostoc, and Lactococcus, and the species Streptococcus
thermophilus, Erysipelatoclostridium ramosum and Leuconostoc mesenteroides (pFDR 
< 0.10). Furthermore, during the HDD, there was a significantly lower abundance
of the genera Faecalibacterium and Bilophila, and the species Faecalibacterium
prausnitzii, Clostridium aldenense, Acetivibrio ethanolgignens, Bilophila
wadsworthia and Lactococcus lactis (pFDR < 0.10). There were eight subjects who
became constipated during the HDD and these subjects all had a lower abundance of
F. prausnitzii. This is the first cross-over study in which the effect of an HDD 
compared to an LDD on the gut microbiome has been studied. An HDD led to a
significantly different composition of the gut microbiome, with a particularly
lower abundance of F. prausnitzii and a higher abundance of S. thermophilus.
Constipation was observed in several subjects during the HDD. Predicted metabolic
pathways were not significantly altered due to an HDD.
