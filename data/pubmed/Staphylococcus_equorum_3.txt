Traditional smoked fermented sausages are highly appreciated in Portugal and are 
mostly manufactured according to traditional procedures. The aim of the present
work was to evaluate the effect of autochthonous starter cultures on the safety
and quality of a smoked fermented sausage, Painho da Beira Baixa (PBB),
preserving its sensory quality. Physicochemical parameters, namely pH and water
activity (aW), microbiological parameters, biogenic amines, colour, texture
profile and sensory attributes were assessed. Different starters were selected
based on our previous work. Staphylococcus equorum S2M7, Staphylococcus xylosus
CECT7057, Lactobacillus sakei CV3C2, Lactobacillus sakei CECT7056 and a yeast
strain (2RB4) were co-inoculated in meat batters at defined concentrations.
Starters had a significant effect on the reduction of pH. Enterobacteria and
Listeria monocytogenes were not detected in inoculated end-product sausages.
Moreover, sausages inoculated with S. equorum S2M7/L. sakei CV3C2/yeast 2RB4
showed a significant reduction in the total content of biogenic amines. No
significant differences between treatments were observed for colour and texture
parameters, except for adhesiveness. The studied starters did not compromise the 
sensory characteristics of PBB. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive
study on the quality and safety of this type of smoked fermented sausage from the
central region of Portugal.
