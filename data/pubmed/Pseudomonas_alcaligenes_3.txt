N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) is an extensively used organic solvent but is also a
potent pollutant. Certain bacterial species from genera such as Paracoccus,
Pseudomonas, and Alcaligenes have evolved to use DMF as a sole carbon and
nitrogen source for growth via degradation by a dimethylformamidase (DMFase). We 
show that DMFase from Paracoccus sp. strain DMF is a halophilic and thermostable 
enzyme comprising a multimeric complex of the α2 β2 or (α2 β2 )2 type. One of the
three domains of the large subunit and the small subunit are hitherto undescribed
protein folds of unknown evolutionary origin. The active site consists of a
mononuclear iron coordinated by two Tyr side-chain phenolates and one carboxylate
from Glu. The Fe3+ ion in the active site catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of
the amide bond in DMF. Kinetic characterization reveals that the enzyme shows
cooperativity between subunits, and mutagenesis and structural data provide clues
to the catalytic mechanism.
