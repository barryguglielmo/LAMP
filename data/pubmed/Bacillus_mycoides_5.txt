This study examined how soil mercury contamination affected the structure and
functionality of rhizobacteria communities from Aeschynomene fluminensis and
Polygonum acuminatum and how rhizobacteria mediate metal bioremediation. The
strains were isolated using culture-dependent methods, identified through 16S
rDNA gene sequencing, and characterized with respect to their functional traits
related to plant growth promotion and resistance to metals and antibiotics. The
bioremediation capacity of the rhizobacteria was determined in greenhouse using
corn plants. The isolated bacteria belonged to the phyla Actinobacteria,
Deinococcus-Thermus, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria, with great abundance of the 
species Microbacterium trichothecenolyticum. The rhizobacteria abundance,
richness, and diversity were greater in mercury-contaminated soils. Bacteria
isolated from contaminated environments had higher minimum inhibitory
concentration values, presented plasmids and the merA gene, and were
multi-resistant to metals and antibiotics. Enterobacter sp._C35 and M.
trichothecenolyticum_C34 significantly improved (Dunnett's test, p < 0.05) corn
plant growth in mercury-contaminated soil. These bacteria helped to reduce up to 
87% of the mercury content in the soil, and increased the mercury bioaccumulation
factor by up to 94%. Mercury bioremediation mitigated toxicity of the
contaminated substrate. Enterobacter sp._C35, Bacillus megaterium_C28, and
Bacillus mycoides_C1 stimulated corn plant growth and could be added to
biofertilizers produced in research and related industries.
