Background: Paranasal sinuses act as bacterial reservoirs and contribute to
transmitting bacteria to the lower airway of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). 
Also, passage of bacteria from the oral cavity to the lungs may occur.
Methods: We evaluated the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus
aureus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Serratia
marcescens in sputum and nasal lavage of 59 patients with CF, and also collected 
saliva and used toothbrushes from 38 of them. We assessed the clonal identity of 
the strains isolated from the different samples by pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis.
Results: About 80% of the patients were positive for at least one of the
bacterial species examined in nasal lavage and sputum. Among the subjects with
positive sputum, 74% presented the same species in the nasal lavage and saliva,
and 26% on their toothbrush. S. aureus was the most abundant species in all
samples. Clonal identity (≥80% similarity) of the strains isolated among the
different samples from each patient was confirmed in almost all cases.
Longitudinal observation helped to identify five patients who were colonised in
the lower airways after an initial period of nasal or oral colonisation.
Conclusion: Nasal and oral sites act as bacterial reservoirs, favouring the
transmission of potentially pathogenic microorganisms to the lower airway. The
lack of eradication from these sites might undermine the antibiotic therapy
applied to treat the lung infection, allowing the persistence of the bacteria
within the patient if colonisation of these sites is not assessed, and no
specific therapy is performed.
