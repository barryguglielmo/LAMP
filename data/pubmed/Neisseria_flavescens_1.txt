Coeliac disease (CD) is a multifactorial autoimmune disorder and gut dysbiosis
contributes to its pathogenesis. We previously profiled by 16S rRNA sequencing
duodenal and oropharyngeal microbiomes in active CD (a-CD), gluten-free diet
(GFD) patients, and controls (CO) and found significantly higher levels of
Neisseria spp., with pro-inflammatory activities, in a-CD patients than in the
other two groups. In this study, we developed a fast and simple qPCR-based method
to evaluate the abundance of the oral Neisseria spp. and the diagnostic
performances of the test in CD diagnosis. The Neisseria spp. abundances detected 
by quantitative PCR (qPCR) were: CO = 0.14, GFD = 0.15, a-CD = 2.08, showing a
similar trend to those previously measured by next generation sequencing (NGS).
In particular, Neisseria spp. values obtained by both methods were significantly 
higher (p < 0.001) in a-CD than in the other two groups GFD and CO-the latter
almost overlapping. We calculated by ROC curve analysis the threshold of 1.12
ng/Î¼L of Neisseria spp. to discriminate between CO+GFD and a-CD patients with
100% and 96.7% of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, respectively. In
conclusion, our data, if confirmed in other cohorts, suggest the q-PCR evaluation
of oral Neisseria spp. could be a fast and simple method to assess CD-associated 
dysbiosis for diagnostic purposes.
