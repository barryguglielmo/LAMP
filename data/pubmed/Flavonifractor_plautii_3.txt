The bacterium Flavonifractor plautii (FP), which is found in human feces, has
been reported to participate in catechin metabolism in the gut, but this
bacterium's effects on immune function are unclear. We assessed the effect of
oral administration of FP on the immune response in ovalbumin (OVA) -sensitized
mice. We demonstrated that the FP treatment suppressed interleukin (IL)-4 in
splenocytes and OVA-specific IgE production in serum from OVA-sensitized mice.
Moreover, oral administration of FP augmented CD4+CD25+ T cells and CD103+CD11c+ 
DCs. In animals of the FP group, the proportion of FP was increased in the
mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), as was the proportion of Deferribacteres in the
cecum. Oral administration of FP may inhibit the Th2 immune response by
incorporation into the MLNs and/or by inducing changes in the gut microbiota.
Thus, FP may be useful in alleviating antigen-induced Th2 immune responses.
