Improving the physicochemical properties of okara for various applications in
foods is of great importance. Here, okara and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC)
were atomized using a water jet (WJ) system. The WJ-treated okara and MCC
dispersed homogeneously in water, and their median sizes in particle size
distribution were 6.6 μm and 9.5 μm, respectively. The dispersions of WJ-treated 
okara and MCC showed high apparent viscosity and shear thinning behavior.
Moreover, the inhibition of α-amylase activities by WJ-treated okara was more
effective than that by untreated MCC and cellulose. Furthermore, the production
of short-chain fatty acids by 32 dominant species of human gut microbes was
determined. An increase in butyrate production by Roseburia intestinalis was
observed in the presence of WJ-treated okara, but not in untreated okara or
WJ-treated MCC. These results demonstrate that WJ system can be used on okara to 
increase inhibited α-amylase activities and butyrate production by gut
microbiota.
