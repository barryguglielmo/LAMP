In addition to the industrial and biomedical applications of lithium, information
on the tolerance of microorganisms to high Li concentrations in natural
biological systems is limited. Strain LCHXa is a novel free-living Gram-positive,
non-motile bacterium strain isolated from water samples taken at Laguna Chaxa, a 
non-industrial water body with the highest soluble Li content (33 mM LiCl) within
the Salar de Atacama basin in northern Chile. Enrichment was conducted in
Luria-Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with 1 M LiCl. Strain LCHXa was a
Novobiocin-resistant and coagulase negative Staphylococcus. Phylogenetically,
strain LCHXa belongs to the species Staphylococcus sciuri. Strain LCHXa grew
optimally in LB medium at pH 6-8 and 37 °C, and it was able to sustain growth at 
molar Li concentrations at 2 M LiCl, with a decrease in the specific growth rate 
of 85%. Osmoregulation in strain LCHXa partially involves glycine betaine and
glycerol as compatible solutes.
