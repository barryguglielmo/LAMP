Uterine infection is associated with infertility in women and dairy cows, even
after the resolution of infection. However, the mechanisms causing this
persistent infertility are unclear. Here, we hypothesized that induced
endometritis in non-lactating dairy cows would reduce the developmental
competence of oocytes. Non-lactating Holstein cows received an intrauterine
infusion of endometrial pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli and Trueperella
pyogenes; n = 12) or vehicle control (n = 11) on day 2 of the estrous cycle.
Bacterial infusion increased expression of endometrial inflammatory mediators,
and a mucopurulent discharge in the vagina confirmed the establishment of
endometritis. Oocytes were collected by transvaginal ultrasound-guided ovum
pickup on days 2, 24, 45, and 66 following infusion and subjected to in vitro
fertilization and embryo culture. Bacterial infusion resulted in fewer cleaved
oocytes developing to morulae compared to vehicle-infused controls (30.7 versus
45.0%), with the greatest effect observed in oocytes collected on day 24.
Development to morula was inversely correlated with endometrial expression of IL6
on day 6. The expression of genes associated with embryo quality did not differ
significantly between morulae from bacteria-infused and control cows. Artificial 
insemination 130 days after intrauterine infusion resulted in normal, filamentous
embryos that produced interferon tau 16 days after conception in both infusion
groups. This model of experimentally induced uterine infection successfully
resulted in endometritis and a reduction in the proportion of oocytes that
developed to morulae following in vitro fertilization. In conclusion,
endometritis reduced the capacity of oocytes to develop to morulae.
