We previously reported a protective association between single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs; rs4415345G and rs4610776A alleles) of Paneth cell
α-defensin-5 against acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). Because dysbiosis
has been associated with aGVHD, we hypothesized that these SNPs may have a gut
microbiota signature. In Lasso regression analysis of 248 healthy individuals,
rs4415345G was associated with a higher abundance of Odoribacter splanchnicus, an
anaerobic butyrogenic commensal. In multivariable analysis of data from 613
allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplant recipients, peri-engraftment presence
of O. splanchnicus was associated with ~50% lower risk for grade II-IV aGVHD
(hazard ratio 0·53, 95% confidence interval 0·28-1·00, P = 0·05). O. splanchnicus
may protect rs4415345G individuals against aGVHD.
