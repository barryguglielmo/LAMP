The flavobacterium Chryseobacterium polytrichastri was investigated for its
volatile profile by use of a closed-loop stripping apparatus (CLSA) and
subsequent GC-MS analysis. The analyses revealed a rich headspace extract with 71
identified compounds. Compound identification was based on a comparison to
library mass spectra for known compounds and on a synthesis of authentic
standards for unknowns. Important classes were phenylethyl amides and a series of
corresponding imines and pyrroles.
