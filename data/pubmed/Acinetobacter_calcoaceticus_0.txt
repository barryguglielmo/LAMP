The rising prevalence of multidrug-resistant hospital-acquired infections has
increased the need for new antibacterial agents. In this study, a library of 1586
FDA-approved drugs was screened against A. calcoaceticus, a representative of the
Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex. Three compounds were found to have
previously undiscovered antibacterial properties against A. calcoaceticus:
antifungal Miconazole, anthelminthic Dichlorophen, and Bithionol. These three
drugs were tested against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative
bacteria and confirmed to have broad-spectrum antibacterial properties.
Combinations of these three drugs were also tested against the same bacteria, and
two novel combination therapies with synergistic effects were discovered. In the 
future, antibacterial properties of these three drugs and two combination
therapies will be evaluated against pathogenic bacteria using an animal model.
