Heme oxygenase (HO)-1, a rate-limiting enzyme in heme catabolism, results in the 
formation of equivalent amounts of biliverdin (BV), carbon monoxide (CO) and
ferrous iron (Fe2+). Previous studies have revealed that HO-1 plays an important 
role in immune responses. However, the mechanism underlying the immune responses 
against bacterial infection of teleost HO-1 remains enigmatic. To decipher the
mechanisms, we have cloned and characterized the HO-1 gene of grass carp
(designated as GcHO-1) in this research. The results showed that the open reading
frame (ORF) of GcHO-1 was 819 bp, which encoded a putative protein of 272 amino
acids. The deduced amino acid sequence phylogenetically shared the highest
identity with other teleosts, and contained two domains of heme-oxygenase and a
single-pass transmembrane domain. The mRNA expressions of GcHO-1 in healthy grass
carp have widely existed in examined tissues in the following order of
spleen > head-kidney > middle
head-kidney > intestines > liver > gills > heart > muscle > brain. Besides, the
mRNA and protein transcription of GcHO-1 were both significantly up-regulated in 
the liver and head-kidney tissues after Staphylococcus aureus and Aeromonas
hydrophila infection. In addition, overexpression of GcHO-1 in kidney cell line
(CIK) cells of grass carp could reduce the expression of inﬂammatory cytokines
(IL-1β, IL-8, TNFα, CCL1 and IL-6). Herein, we demonstrate that GcHO-1 plays an
anti-inflammatory role in innate immunity. Our results shed new light on the
mechanisms underlying the antibacterial immunity of teleost.
