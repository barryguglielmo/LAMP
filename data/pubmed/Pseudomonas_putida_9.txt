A large variety of microorganisms produces biosurfactants with the potential for 
a number of diverse industrial applications. To identify suitable wild-type or
engineered production strains, efficient screening methods are needed, allowing
for rapid and reliable quantification of biosurfactants in multiple cultures,
preferably at high throughput. To this end, we have established a novel and
sensitive assay for the quantification of biosurfactants based on the dye
Victoria Pure Blue BO (VPBO). The assay allows the colorimetric assessment of
biosurfactants directly in culture supernatants and does not require extraction
or concentration procedures. Working ranges were determined for precise
quantification of different rhamnolipid biosurfactants; titers in culture
supernatants of recombinant Pseudomonas putida KT2440 calculated by this assay
were confirmed to be the same ranges detected by independent high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC)-charged aerosol detector (CAD) analyses. The assay
was successfully applied for detection of chemically different anionic or
non-ionic biosurfactants including mono- and di-rhamnolipids (glycolipids),
mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs, glycolipids), 3-(3-hydroxyalkanoyloxy) alkanoic 
acids (fatty acid conjugates), serrawettin W1 (lipopeptide), and N-acyltyrosine
(lipoamino acid). In summary, the VPBO assay offers a broad range of applications
including the comparative evaluation of different cultivation conditions and
high-throughput screening of biosurfactant-producing microbial strains.
