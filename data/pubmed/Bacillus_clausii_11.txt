Both spore and vegetative forms of Bacillus species have been used as probiotics,
and they have high stability to the surrounding atmospheric conditions such as
heat, gastric conditions, and moisture. The commercial Bacillus probiotic strains
in use are B. cereus, B. clausii, B. coagulans, B. licheniformis, B.
polyfermenticus, B. pumilus, and B. subtilis. These strains have antimicrobial,
anticancer, antioxidant, and vitamin production properties. However, Bacillus
probiotics can also produce toxins and biogenic amines and transfer antibiotic
resistance genes; therefore, their safety is a concern. Studies on the microbiome
using probiotic Bacillus strains are limited in humans. Most microbiome research 
has been conducted in chicken, mouse, and pig. Some Bacillus probiotics are used 
as fermentation starters in plant and soybean and dietary supplement of baking
foods as a probiotic carrier. This review summarizes the characterization of
Bacillus species as probiotics for human use and their safety, microbiome, and
probiotic carrier.
