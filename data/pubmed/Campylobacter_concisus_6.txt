Campylobacter concisus is an emerging bacterial pathogen that may play a role in 
the development of inflammatory bowel disease and oral inflammatory conditions
such as periodontal disease. To elucidate the role and pathogenic mechanisms of
C. concisus in contributing to oral inflammation, this study examined the
production of IL-1 family proinflammatory cytokines IL-18 and IL-1β in oral
epithelial cells induced by C. concisus strains using enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA), Western-blot and quantitative real-time PCR. C. concisus increased
the mRNA levels of IL-18 and IL-1β in oral epithelial cells. Furthermore, a large
amount of IL-18 in the supernatants of oral epithelial cells infected with
C. concisus strains was detected by ELISA, and various experiments demonstrated
that this positive signal was derived from C. concisus bacterium. The findings
that C. concisus upregulated IL-18 and IL-1β in oral epithelial cells from this
study support a role of C. concisus in oral inflammatory diseases. Furthermore,
the finding that C. concisus released a molecule that was strongly cross-reactive
to anti-human IL-18 monoclonal antibodies suggests that in future studies
examining cytokines induced by bacterial microbes, a bacterium control should be 
included.
