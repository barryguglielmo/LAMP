BACKGROUND: Soybean meal (SBM) is the most common protein source used in the
poultry and livestock industries. It has high-quality protein, an excellent amino
acid (AA) profile, and positive isoflavone properties. However, the antigen
proteins in SBM are unsuitable for young animals. The objective of this study was
to identify a Bacillus strain that can degrade soybean antigen proteins, and to
evaluate the feasibility of its application in SBM fermentation.
RESULTS: Bacillus velezensis DP-2 was isolated from Douchi, a fermented Chinese
food. It degraded 96.14% and 66.51% of glycinin and β-conglycinin, and increased 
the trichloroacetic acid-soluble protein (TCAN) content by 5.46 times in the SBM
medium. DP-2 could secrete alkaline protease and neutral protease, with
productivities of 5.85 and 5.99 U mL-1 . It had broad-spectrum, antibacterial
activities against Rhizopus nigricans HR, Fusarium oxysporum ACCC37404,
Penicillium digitatum SQ2, Aspergillus flavus C1, Aspergillus niger ACCC30005,
Trichoderma viride YZ1, Candida tropicalis CICC1630, and Salmonella sp. ZY. For
SBM fermentation, the optimal inoculum rate, temperature, and fermentation time
of DP-2 were 2.21 × 107 CFU g-1 , 37 °C, and 48 h, respectively. The fermented
soybean meal (FSBM) was cream-colored and glutinous. Its crude protein (CP),
soluble protein, and TCA-N content were improved by 13.45%, 12.53%, and 6.37
times, respectively. The glycinin and β-conglycinin content were reduced by
78.00% and 43.07%, respectively, compared with raw SBM.
CONCLUSIONS: Bacillus velezensis DP-2 has potential as a starter culture for SBM 
fermentation. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.
