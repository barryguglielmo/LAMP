BACKGROUND: Streptococcus thermophilus is an important food starter and receiving
more attention to serve as cell factories for production of high-valued
metabolites. However, the low yields of intracellular or extracellular expression
of biotechnological and biomedical proteins limit its practical applications.
RESULTS: Here, an enolase EnoM was identified from S. thermophilus CGMCC7.179
with about 94% identities to the surface-located enolases from other
Streptococcus spp. strains. The EnoM was used as an anchor to achieve surface
display in S. thermophilus using GFP as a reporter. After respectively mixing the
GFP-EnoM fusion protein or GFP with S. thermophilus cells in vitro, the relative 
fluorescence units (RFU) of the S. thermophilus cells with GFP-EnoM was 80-folds 
higher than that with purified GFP. The sharp decrease in the RFU of sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS) pretreated cells compared to those of non-pretreated cells 
demonstrated that the membrane proteins were the binding ligand of EnoM.
Furthermore, an engineered β-galactosidase (β-Gal) was also successfully
displayed on the cell surface of S. thermophilus CGMCC7.179 and the relative
activity of the immobilized β-Gal remained up to 64% after reused 8 times.
Finally, we also demonstrated that EnoM could be used as an anchor for surface
display in L. casei, L. bulgaricus, L. lactis and Leuconostoc lactis.
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, EnoM from S. thermophilus was firstly identified as
an anchor and successfully achieved surface display in LAB. The EnoM-based
surface display system provided a novel strategy for the enzyme immobilization.
