Little is known regarding the impact of immigrant acculturation on the gut
microbiome. We characterized differences in the gut microbiome between
racially/ethnically diverse US immigrant and US-born groups, and determined the
impact of dietary acculturation on the microbiome. Stool samples were collected
from 863 US residents, including US-born (315 White, 93 Black, 40 Hispanic) and
foreign-born (105 Hispanic, 264 Korean) groups. We determined dietary
acculturation from dissimilarities based on food frequency questionnaires, and
used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the microbiome. Gut microbiome
composition differed across study groups, with the largest difference between
foreign-born Koreans and US-born Whites, and significant differences also
observed between foreign-born and US-born Hispanics. Differences in
sub-operational taxonomic unit (s-OTU) abundance between foreign-born and US-born
groups tended to be distinct from differences between US-born groups. Bacteroides
plebeius, a seaweed-degrading bacterium, was strongly enriched in foreign-born
Koreans, while Prevotella copri and Bifidobacterium adolescentis were strongly
enriched in foreign-born Koreans and Hispanics, compared with US-born Whites.
Dietary acculturation in foreign-born participants was associated with specific
s-OTUs, resembling abundance in US-born Whites; e.g., a Bacteroides plebeius
s-OTU was depleted in highly diet-acculturated Koreans. In summary, we observed
that US nativity is a determinant of the gut microbiome in a US resident
population. Dietary acculturation may result in loss of native species in
immigrants, though further research is necessary to explore whether
acculturation-related microbiome alterations have consequences for immigrant
health.
