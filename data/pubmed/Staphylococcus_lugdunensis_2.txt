Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a commensal bacterium in humans and other animals
that can cause serious infections. The aim of this research was to estimate the
frequency of S. lugdunensis in pet cats and to characterize the S. lugdunensis
isolates obtained. The prevalence of S. lugdunensis was 0.77% (4/523) in healthy 
cats and 1.23% (1/81) in sick cats. The isolates (N = 5), which colonized
conjunctival sacs, nares, and the anus, were almost fully phenotypically
sensitive to antibiotics, but harbored resistance genes to four chemotherapeutic 
groups. Their sequence types (STs) included ST2, ST3, ST9, and ST15. There was
detected a far lower prevalence of S. lugdunensis in pet cats than is reported in
the human population. Nevertheless, the phenotypic and genotypic properties of S.
lugdunensis isolates found in the current study were very similar to those
described previously in isolates of human origin.
