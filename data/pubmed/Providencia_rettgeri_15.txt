Penicillin G acylase (PGA) from Providencia rettgeri PX04 (PrPGA) was utilized to
synthesize β-lactam antibiotics. Poly-lysine supported cross-linked enzyme
aggregates (PL-CLEAs) were prepared using PGA. Addition of poly-lysine
significantly increased retention of PGA activity in CLEAs, with a decrease in
the synthesis/hydrolysis (S/H) ratio. PL-CLEAs with 0.56 mg/mL poly-lysine
retained 83% of free PGA activity, and displayed a higher S/H ratio than that of 
the free enzyme. Both PL-CLEAs and CLEAs exhibited high pH and thermal
stabilities. PL-CLEAs possessed the best stability profile, and the lowest α
value [(kcat/Km)Ps/(kcat/Km)AD], and was most effective at amoxicillin synthesis.
A >94% yield of amoxicillin was achieved using a D-HPGME/6-APA ratio of 1.2:1
(240 mM, 200 mM), with fed-batch addition of D-HPGME. PL-CLEAs displayed
excellent operational stability during amoxicillin synthesis. Over 97% of initial
conversion was retained after twenty rounds of catalysis. PL-CLEAs exhibited
greater potency than CLEAs in practical catalysis, permitting a higher
concentration of reactants.
