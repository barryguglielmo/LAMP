Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a serious healthcare dilemma, associated with
specific changes in gut microbiota and circulating metabolome. Yet, the
functional capacity of CKD microbiome and its intricate relationship with the
host metabolism at different stages of disease are less understood.METHODS: Here,
shotgun sequencing of fecal samples and targeted metabolomics profiling of serum 
bile acids, short- and medium-chain fatty acids, and uremic solutes were
performed in a cohort of CKD patients with different severities and non-CKD
controls.
RESULTS: We identified that levels of 13 microbial species and 6 circulating
metabolites were significantly altered across early to advanced stages or only in
particular stage(s). Among these, Prevotella sp. 885 (decreased) was associated
with urea excretion, while caproic acid (decreased) and p-cresyl sulfate
(elevated) were positively and negatively correlated with the glomerular
filtration rate, respectively. In addition, we identified gut microbial species
linked to changes in circulating metabolites. Microbial genes related to
secondary bile acid biosynthesis were differentially abundant at the early stage,
while pathway modules related to lipid metabolism and lipopolysaccharide
biosynthesis were enriched in the CKD microbiome at the advanced stage,
suggesting that changes in microbial metabolism and host inflammation may
contribute to renal health. Further, we identified metagenomic and metabolomic
markers to discriminate cases of different severities from the controls, among
which Bacteroides eggerthii individually was of particular value in early
diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our dual-omics data reveal the connections between intestinal
microbes and circulating metabolites perturbed in CKD, which may be of
etiological and diagnostic importance.
