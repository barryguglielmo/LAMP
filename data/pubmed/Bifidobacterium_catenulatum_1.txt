Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is a major commensal bacterium in the human gut. It 
produces short-chain fatty acids that promote intestinal health. However, the
bacterium is extremely oxygen-sensitive, making it difficult to develop as a
probiotic. To facilitate practical application of F. prausnitzii, we investigated
factors that affect its growth and mammalian gut colonization. We evaluated
cross-feeding interactions between F. prausnitzii and seven Bifidobacterium
strains, and the anti-inflammatory properties of bacterial metabolites produced
in co-culture, in vitro and in vivo. Co-culture of F. prausnitzii and
Bifidobacterium catenulatum, with fructooligosaccharides as an energy source,
resulted in the greatest viable cell-count and butyrate production increases.
Further, the co-culture supernatant reduced the amount of proinflammatory
cytokines produced by HT-29 cells and RAW 264.7 macrophages, an effect that was
similar to that of butyrate. Furthermore, feeding mice both Faecalibacterium and 
Bifidobacterium enhanced F. prausnitzii gut colonization. Finally, feeding the
co-culture supernatant decreased interleukin 8 levels in the colon and increased 
butyrate levels in the cecum in the dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis mouse 
model. These observations indicate that the Faecalibacterium-Bifidobacterium
co-culture exerts an anti-inflammatory effect by promoting F. prausnitzii
survival and short-chain fatty acid production, with possible implications for
the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.
