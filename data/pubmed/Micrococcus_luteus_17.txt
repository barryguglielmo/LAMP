Two new spirotetronate natural products, lobophorin L (1) and lobophorin M (2),
together with three known lobophorin-like spirotetronate antibiotics (3-5) and
two known ansamycins (6-7), were isolated from the marine-derived Streptomyces
sp. 4506. The structures of 1 and 2 were established on the basis of HRESIMS as
well as 1D and 2D NMR datasets. Antibacterial assay showed that, compounds 1 and 
3-5 exhibited strong to moderate antibacterial activities against Micrococcus
luteus and Bacillus thuringiensis with MIC values ranging from 0.0625 to 8 μg/mL,
while compounds 3 and 6 showed weak antibacterial activities against
Staphylococcus aureus and MRSA. The antibacterial activities of the lobophorins
in this study indicated that the more substitution number of the sugar moieties
at C-9 of the lobophorin, the stronger antimicrobial properties it may deserve,
and the higher the oxidation degree of substituent group at C-3D, the better
antibacterial activities of its corresponding compound could be.
