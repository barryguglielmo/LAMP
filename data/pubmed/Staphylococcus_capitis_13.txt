BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus capitis (MRSC) NRCS-A clone
(Multi-resistant and vancomycin-non susceptible) has been recently described as
an emerging cause of nosocomial bacteremia especially in neonatal intensive-care 
units (NICUs).
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the antibiotic and
antiseptic resistance patterns, biofilm producing ability and the prevalence of
SCCmec and ACME types among MRSC isolates as well as to check the possible
presence of NRCS-A clone at Tehran's Children's Medical Center, Iran.
METHODS: A total of 256 coagulase negative Staphylococcal isolates were
collected, of which 10 S. capitis isolates were obtained and tested for
susceptibility against 13 antimicrobial and 3 antiseptic agents, as well as
biofilm production. The presence of 15 distinct resistance genes, staphylococcal 
cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec), and arginine catabolic mobile elements (ACMEs) 
were tracked.
RESULTS: Seven out of 10 S. capitis isolates were MRSC (MIC90 van=8μg/mL) and
resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, produced biofilm, (3 as strong
biofilm producers) and carried ACME types I and II. Despite the identification of
mec and ccr complexes in some isolates, all the SCCmec cassettes were untypeable 
(UT).
CONCLUSION: According to the studied features, only one isolate belonged to the
NRSC-A clone. The results indicate that MRSC with high antibiotic resistance and 
unknown SCCmec might become a serious problem in the future for the treatment of 
patients particularly children.
