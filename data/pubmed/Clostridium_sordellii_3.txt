Gas gangrene is a necrotizing infection of subcutaneous tissue and muscle that
affects mainly ruminants and horses, but also other domestic and wild mammals.
Clostridium chauvoei, C. septicum, C. novyi type A, C. perfringens type A, and C.
sordellii are the etiologic agents of this disease, acting singly or in
combination. Although a presumptive diagnosis of gas gangrene can be established 
based on clinical history, clinical signs, and gross and microscopic changes,
identification of the clostridia involved is required for confirmatory diagnosis.
Gross and microscopic lesions are, however, highly suggestive of the disease.
Although the disease has a worldwide distribution and can cause significant
economic losses, the literature is limited mostly to case reports. Thus, we have 
reviewed the current knowledge of gas gangrene in mammals.
