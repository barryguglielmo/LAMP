A 62-year-old Japanese male presented with graft infection by Staphylococcus
schleiferi 50 days after debranching of the left subclavian artery and frozen
elephant trunk repair for the entry closure of a Stanford type B aortic
dissection. The graft was removed, and the patient was successfully treated using
in situ reconstruction of the arch with omental flap coverage, removal of the
debranching graft, autologous iliac artery grafting, and longterm antibiotics.
Domino reconstruction of the infected debranching graft using autologous external
iliac artery and a Dacron graft can thus be a good option in similar cases.
