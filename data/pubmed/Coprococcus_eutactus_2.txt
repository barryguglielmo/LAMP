BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the prevailing causes of cancer
mortality in the world. A common screening test for CRC is based on the human
hemoglobin immunochemical based fecal occult blood test (iFOBT), which consists
in the detection of blood in the patient's stool. In addition to iFOBT, recent
studies support the use of the gut microbiome as a biomarker for CRC prediction. 
However, these studies did not take into account the effect of blood itself on
the microbiome composition, independently of CRC. Therefore, we investigated the 
microbiome of patients undergoing the iFOBT screening in order to determine the
effect of blood alone. Our cohort consisted of patients who had no blood in their
stools (n = 265) or did have blood but no underlying precancerous or cancerous
lesions (n = 235). We also identified bacterial taxa specifically associated with
the presence of blood in stools.
RESULTS: We observed significant differences in the intestinal bacterial
composition that could be solely caused by the presence of blood in stools. More 
precisely, we identified 12 bacterial species showing significant differences in 
abundance between both our study groups. These species, Bacteroides uniformis,
Collinsella aerofaciens, Eggerthella lenta and Clostridium symbiosum demonstrated
increased abundance in the presence of blood. In contrast, the species Prevotella
copri, Coprococcus eutactus and catus, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia
faecis, Blautia obeum, Gemmiger formicilis and Clostridium celatum showed
decreased abundance in patients with blood in their stools. Notably, we found
multiple taxa that were reported in previous studies linking microbiome
composition and diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: We show that, in the absence of disease, blood in the stools has a
major influence on the composition of the microbiome. Our data suggest that blood
itself should be taken into consideration when investigating the microbiome
signatures of intestinal diseases.
