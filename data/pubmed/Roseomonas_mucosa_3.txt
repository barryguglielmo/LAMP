Despite several methods having been described for disinfecting implants affected 
by periimplantitis, none of these are universally effective and may even alter
surfaces and mechanical properties of implants. Boron-doped diamond (BDD)
electrodes were fabricated from niobium wires and assembled as a single
instrument for implant cleaning. Chemo-mechanical debridement and air abrasion
were used as control methods. Different mono-species biofilms, formed by bacteria
and yeasts, were allowed to develop in rich medium at 37 °C for three days. In
addition, natural multi-species biofilms were treated. Implants were placed in
silicone, polyurethane foam and bovine ribs for simulating different clinical
conditions. Following treatment, the implants were rolled on blood agar plates,
which were subsequently incubated at 37 °C and microbial growth was analyzed.
Complete electrochemical disinfection of implant surfaces was achieved with a
maximum treatment time of 20 min for Candida albicans, Candida dubliniensis,
Enterococcus faecalis, Roseomonas mucosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis and
Streptococcus sanguinis, while in case of spore-forming Bacillus pumilus and
Bacillus subtilis, a number of colonies appeared after BDD electrode treatment
indicating an incomplete disinfection. Independent of the species tested,
complete disinfection was never achieved when conventional techniques were used. 
During treatment with BDD electrodes, only minor changes in temperature and pH
value were observed. The instrument used here requires optimization so that
higher charge quantities can be applied in shorter treatment times.
