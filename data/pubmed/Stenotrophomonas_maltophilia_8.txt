BACKGROUND: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia-induced pulmonary haemorrhage is
considered a fatal infection among haematological patients. The outcome can be
explained by the patients' immunity status and late diagnosis and treatment.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present the rare case of successful outcome in a
61-year-old female who developed alveolar haemorrhage and acute respiratory
distress syndrome 8 days after a chemotherapy session for her acute lymphoblastic
leukaemia, in the context of secondary bone marrow aplasia. Stenotrophomonas
maltophilia was isolated in sputum culture. The patient benefitted from early
empirical treatment with colistin followed by trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole,
according to the antibiogram. Despite a severe initial clinical presentation in
need of mechanical ventilation, neuromuscular blocking agents infusion, and
ventilation in prone position, the patient had a favourable outcome and was
discharged from intensive care after 26â€‰days.
CONCLUSIONS: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia severe pneumonia complicated with
pulmonary haemorrhage is not always fatal in haematological patients. Empirical
treatment of multidrug-resistant Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in an
immunocompromised haematological patient presenting with hemoptysis should be
taken into consideration.
