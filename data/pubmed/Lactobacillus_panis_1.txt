Anaerobic fermentation can produce valuable chemicals from food waste, such as
butyric acid, lactic acid, and ethanol. Three nano iron materials, i.e.
zero-valence iron (nZVI), ferric oxide (nFO), and magnetite (nM), were tested to 
improve food waste fermentation with mixed inoculation. nZVI and nFO enhanced the
dissolution and conversion of carbohydrate to lactate, dependent on different
mechanisms, while nM had almost no effects due to its aggregation at high doses. 
nZVI alleviated the drop of pH, kept the ORP at an anaerobic level, increased
functional enzymes, and resulted in a high hydrolysis rate of 45% and lactic acid
yield of 0.16 g/g VSfed at the dose of 500 mg/(Lfed·d). nFO increased the ORP to 
100 mV, stimulated the enrichment of Pseudomonas, and increased the abundance of 
Lactobacillus_panis, leading to hydrolysis rate of 47% and lactic acid yield of
0.19 g/gVSfed at the dose of 200 mg/(Lfed·d).
