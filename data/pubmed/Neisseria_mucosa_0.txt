Non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) pathogenesis has not been thoroughly evaluated.
Here, we assessed the response of patients with NERD to proton pump inhibitor
(PPI) therapy; changes in the microbiome and biologic marker expression in the
esophageal mucosa were also evaluated. Patients with NERD (n = 55) received
esomeprazole (20 mg) for eight weeks. The treatment response was evaluated at
baseline, week four, and week eight. Esophageal mucosal markers and oropharyngeal
and esophageal microbiomes were analyzed in patients who underwent upper
gastrointestinal endoscopy at screening (n = 18). Complete and partial response
rates at week eight were 60.0% and 32.7% for heartburn, and 61.8% and 29.1% for
regurgitation, respectively. The expressions of several inflammatory cytokines,
including IL-6, IL-8, and NF-κB, were decreased at week eight. Streptococcus,
Haemophilus, Prevotella, Veillonella, Neisseria, and Granulicatella were
prevalent regardless of the time-point (baseline vs. week eight) and organ
(oropharynx vs. esophagus). The overall composition of oropharyngeal and
esophageal microbiomes showed significant difference (P = 0.004), which
disappeared after PPI therapy. In conclusion, half-dose PPI therapy for eight
weeks could effectively control NERD symptoms. The expression of several
inflammatory cytokines was reduced in the esophagus, and oropharyngeal and
esophageal microbiomes in patients with NERD showed significant difference.
However, the microbial compositions in the oropharynx and esophagus were not
affected by PPI therapy in this study. Impact of PPI on the microbiome in
patients with NERD should be more investigated in future studies.
