The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-antigen structure of the plant pathogen Rhizobium 
radiobacter strain TT9 and its possible role in a plant-microbe interaction was
investigated. The analyses disclosed the presence of two O-antigens, named Poly1 
and Poly2. The repetitive unit of Poly2 constitutes a 4-α-l-rhamnose linked to a 
3-α-d-fucose residue. Surprisingly, Poly1 turned out to be a novel type of
biopolymer in which the repeating unit is formed by a monosaccharide and an
amino-acid derivative, so that the polymer has alternating glycosidic and amidic 
bonds joining the two units: 4-amino-4-deoxy-3-O-methyl-d-fucose and
(2'R,3'R,4'S)-N-methyl-3',4'-dihydroxy-3'-methyl-5'-oxoproline). Differently from
the O-antigens of LPSs from other pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, these two
O-antigens do not activate the oxidative burst, an early innate immune response
in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, explaining at least in part the ability 
of this R. radiobacter strain to avoid host defenses during a plant infection
process.
