A lignocellulose-degrading strain isolated from thermophilic compost was
identified as Geobacillus stearothermophilus B5, and found able to secrete
considerable amounts of enzymes at optimal temperature (60 Â°C) and pH (7.5). One 
circular contig of 3.37 Mbp was assembled from raw data, and 3371 protein-coding 
genes were predicted. Clusters of orthologous groups (COG) analysis revealed
various genes with functions in polymeric substrate degradation, especially for
Carbohydrate Active enZymes (CAZymes), such as glycoside hydrolases (GHs) and
glycosyl transferases (GTs). Furthermore, the transcriptional responses of B5 at 
different temperatures-with rice straw provided as the sole carbon source-were
analyzed. The results revealed that B5 could resist high temperature by
upregulating heat shock proteins (HSPs), enhancing protein synthesis, and
decreasing carbon catabolism. Briefly, B5 possesses the ability of lignocellulose
degradation, and might be considered a potential inoculant for improving
composting efficiency.
