Streptococcus intermedius is a β-hemolytic Gram-positive member of the
Streptococcus anginosus group (SAG). Despite being a part of the normal
microbiota, it is one of the most common pathogens associated with brain and
liver abscesses and thoracic empyema, increasing as a result the morbidity and
mortality rates in affected patients. Though there are numerous published case
reports on S. intermedius infections, it is still understudied compared to other 
SAG members. Our knowledge of the genomic factors contributing to its
dissemination to the brain and abscess development is also limited to few
characterized genes. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge on S.
intermedius identification methods, virulence factors, and insight provided by
the whole-genome and correlate patients' metadata, symptoms, and disease outcome 
with S. intermedius infections in 101 recent case reports obtained from PubMed.
This combined information highlights the gaps in our understanding of S.
intermedius pathogenesis, suggesting future research directions to unveil the
factors contributing to abscess development.
