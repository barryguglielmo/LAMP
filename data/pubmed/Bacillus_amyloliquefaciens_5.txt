The ability to recognize and respond to environmental signals is essential for
plants. In response to environmental changes, the status of a plant is
transmitted to other plants in the form of signals such as volatiles.
Root-associated bacteria trigger the release of plant volatile organic compounds 
(VOCs). However, the impact of VOCs on the rhizosphere microbial community of
neighbouring plants is not well understood. Here, we investigated the effect of
VOCs on the rhizosphere microbial community of tomato plants inoculated with a
plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain GB03 and 
that of their neighbouring plants. Interestingly, high similarity (up to 69%) was
detected in the rhizosphere microbial communities of the inoculated and
neighbouring plants. Leaves of the tomato plant treated with strain GB03-released
β-caryophyllene as a signature VOC, which elicited the release of a large amount 
of salicylic acid (SA) in the root exudates of a neighbouring tomato seedling.
The exposure of tomato leaves to β-caryophyllene resulted in the secretion of SA 
from the root. Our results demonstrate for the first time that the composition of
the rhizosphere microbiota in surrounding plants is synchronized through aerial
signals from plants.
