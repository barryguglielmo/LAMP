Combination of arylidene hydrazinyl moiety with pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-one
skeleton in compounds 7‒26 results in the output of unprecedented anti-microbial 
agents. Arylidene hydrazinyl based on Pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-one analoges 7‒26 
prepared by the treatment of [2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-ones 6a,b with various aromatic
aldehydes. The antimicrobial action for recently synthesized compounds was
considered towards gram positive bacterial species (Staphylococcus aurous ATCC-
47077; Bacillus cereus ATCC-12228), gram negative bacterial species (Escherichia 
coli ATCC-25922; Salmonella typhi ATCC-15566) and Candida albicans ATCC-10231 as 
fungal strains. The antimicrobial action expanded by expanding the electron
donating group in position 2 and 5 for Pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-one core.
Derivatives 13, 14, 15, 16 and 12; individually appeared hopeful anti-microbial
action towards all strains utilized with inhibition zone higher than that of
standard reference drug with lowest MIC.
