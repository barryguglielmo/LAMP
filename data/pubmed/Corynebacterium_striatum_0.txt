Corynebacterium striatum is emerging as an opportunistic pathogen in
immunocompromised hosts. End-stage renal disease remains an underappreciated
state of immunocompromise. We present a series of individuals with end-stage
kidney disease on hemodialysis who developed Corynebacterium striatum bacteremia,
which was initially thought to be a contaminant, but eventually recognized as the
culprit pathogen. We review the bacteriology of C. striatum, increasing
resistance, as well as known cases of C. striatum bacteremia in the setting of
end-stage renal disease. These cases highlight the importance of a high index of 
suspicion when interpreting bacterial cultures in patients with end-stage renal
disease.
