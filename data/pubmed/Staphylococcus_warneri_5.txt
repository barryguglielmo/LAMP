Toxic metal contamination in soils due industrialization is nowadays a concern to
the scientists worldwide. The current study deals with the evaluation of response
and tolerance by isolated metallophilic bacteria in different lead concentrations
(100 ppm to 1000 ppm). By taking optical densities of the isolates, the minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Pb2+ were determined.16S rRNA and MALDI-TOF MS 
were used for the identification of the bacteria. Total of 37 isolates were
observed, among them 04 (Staphylococcus equorum, Staphylococcus warneri, Bacillus
safensis and Bacillus thuringiensis), isolated were detected having efficacy of
Pb2+tolerance and sequestration at varying MIC. Furthermore, B. thuringiensis was
observed to have highest (900 ppm) tolerance for lead and lowest (500 ppm) for
Staphylococcus warneri. Moreover, the highest (65.3%) sequestration potential has
been observed for B. thuringiensis and least (52.8%) for S. warneri. The
tolerance and sequestration potential properties of these isolated species can be
utilised to exterminate heavy metals and reduce their toxicity from the
contaminated environment.
