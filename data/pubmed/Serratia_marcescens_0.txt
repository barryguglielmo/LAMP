The endotoxin lipopolysaccharides (LPS), secreted from gram-negative bacteria,
has direct effects on synaptic transmission independent of systemic secondary
cytokine responses. High concentration of LPS (500 µg/ml) from Serratia
marcescens increased synaptic efficacy at glutamatergic low-output synapses more 
than for high-output synapses. Over an hour of exposure was not toxic to the
preparation and continued to enhance synaptic transmission. A small but
significant rapid hyperpolarization of the post-synaptic cells occurred, in
addition to a slower enhancement of in the amplitude of evoked excitatory
junction potentials. LPS may promote reserve pool vesicles to the readily
releasable pool for low-output synapses. The action of LPS at the glutamatergic
synapses of the crayfish neuromuscular junction is unique in promoting synaptic
transmission as compared to other glutamatergic synapses in Drosophila and
mammals, where synaptic transmission is depressed.
