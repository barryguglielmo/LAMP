Haemophilus parainfluenzae is considered part of the normal oropharyngeal flora
but is known to occasionally cause infections. It is closely related to
Haemophilus influenzae Here, we report the genome sequence of H. parainfluenzae
COPD-014-E1 O, which was cultured from the sputum of a patient with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.
