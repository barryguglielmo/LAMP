BACKGROUND: While the physical and chemical properties of airborne particulate
matter (PM) have been extensively studied, their associated microbiome remains
largely unexplored. Here, we performed a longitudinal metagenomic survey of 106
samples of airborne PM2.5 and PM10 in Beijing over a period of 6Â months in 2012
and 2013, including those from several historically severe smog events.
RESULTS: We observed that the microbiome composition and functional potential
were conserved between PM2.5 and PM10, although considerable temporal variations 
existed. Among the airborne microorganisms, Propionibacterium acnes, Escherichia 
coli, Acinetobacter lwoffii, Lactobacillus amylovorus, and Lactobacillus reuteri 
dominated, along with several viral species. We further identified an extensive
repertoire of genes involved in antibiotic resistance and detoxification,
including transporters, transpeptidases, and thioredoxins. Sample stratification 
based on Air Quality Index (AQI) demonstrated that many microbial species,
including those associated with human, dog, and mouse feces, exhibit
AQI-dependent incidence dynamics. The phylogenetic and functional diversity of
air microbiome is comparable to those of soil and water environments, as its
composition likely derives from a wide variety of sources.
CONCLUSIONS: Airborne particulate matter accommodates rich and dynamic microbial 
communities, including a range of microbial elements that are associated with
potential health consequences.
