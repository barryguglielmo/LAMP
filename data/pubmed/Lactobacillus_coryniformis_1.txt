Background: Exopolysaccharides (EPSs) secreted from lactic acid bacteria are
carbohydrate polymers with reported biological activities. In this study, we
extracted and characterized the composition as well as antioxidant and
biofilm-inhibitory properties of EPS from Lactobacillus coryniformis NA-3
isolated from northeast Chinese sauerkraut (Suan Cai).
Methods: Lactobacillus coryniformis NA-3 was identified with 16S rDNA
amplification and Neighbor Joining (NJ) phylogenetic analysis. EPS derived from
Lactobacillus coryniformis NA-3 (EPS-NA3) was analyzed, including compositions by
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), functional groups by
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and glycosidic bond configuration
by Hydrogen-1 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR). Antioxidant activity of EPS
was evaluated with hydroxyl and superoxide radical-scavenging. Anti-biofilm
activities of EPS-NA3 were checked through inhibition and dispersion.
Results: The monosaccharide composition of EPS included α-rhamnose, α-mannose,
α-galactose, and α-glucose in a ratio of 2.6:1.0:5.0:3.3. The free
radical-scavenging abilities of EPS-NA3 were 37.77% ± 1.56% and 78.87% ± 3.07% on
hydroxyl and superoxide reactive oxygen species respectively. Moreover, EPS-NA3
attenuated the formation of Bacillus cereus and Salmonella typhimurium biofilms
by inhibition ratios of approximately 80% and 40% respectively. Additionally,
treatment with EPS-NA3 dispersed established biofilms of B. cereus and S.
typhimurium by approximately 90% and 20% respectively.
Conclusion: These results suggest that EPS-NA3 may be developed as antioxidant
and anti-biofilm agents for industrial and clinical applications due to its
capacity of scavenging free radicals, inhibition of bacterial biofilm formation, 
and dispersion of established biofilms.
