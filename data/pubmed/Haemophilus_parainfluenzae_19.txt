INTRODUCTION: While recent reports underscore the significance of the gut
microbiome (GM) in health and disease, its importance in burn outcomes remains
unclear. Moreover, aggressive intravenous (IV) fluid resuscitation of patients
may alter intestinal flora. Herein, we describe GM changes following a large burn
in swine randomized to different volumes of IV Lactated Ringers' (LR).
METHODS: Anesthetized Yorkshire swine sustained 40% total body surface area
full-thickness burns and were randomized to different volumes of IV LR: none
(n = 5), 15 mL/kg/d (low; n = 6), or 80 mL/kg/d (high; n = 6). At baseline and
days 1 and 2, fecal swabs were collected for 16s rDNA sequencing. Proximal
jejunum was collected immediately after euthanasia (day 2) for western blot,
histopathology, and cytokine analyses.
RESULTS: Burns produced significant shifts in β-diversity and non-significant
reductions in α-diversity that did not recover regardless of treatment group.
Burn-induced increases in Proteobacteria and decreases in Firmicutes were
attenuated by IV fluids in a dose-dependent manner, and also correlated with
α-diversity. IV fluids caused a dose-dependent increase in Bacteroides and
prevented a transient increase in the opportunistic pathogen Haemophilus
parainfluenzae. While high volumes of IV fluids increased intestinal Hsp70 levels
(P = 0.0464), they reduced SGLT1 (P = 0.0213) and caspase3 (P = 0.0139) levels.
IV fluids elicited a non-specific cytokine response; however, Bacteroidetes
levels correlated with intestinal IL18 levels (P = 0.0166, R = 0.4201).
CONCLUSIONS: We present the first report on the gut microbiome in a porcine burn 
model, and present data to suggest that IV fluids may influence GM and gut
functional proteins following a burn. Overall, burn-induced GM diversity shifts
may expose diagnostic and/or therapeutic targets to improve outcomes.
