OBJECTIVES: Group B Streptococcus (Streptococcus agalactiae, GBS) is a pathogen
of growing importance in adults. The objective was to describe the features of
GBS invasive infections in non-pregnant adults.
METHODS: GBS infections were reported to the national reference centre for
Streptococci. Clinical information was abstracted from questionnaires. Capsular
typing, identification of the hypervirulent CC-17 clone, and antibiotic
susceptibility testing were performed for all GBS isolates. Multi-locus sequence 
typing and assignment to clonal complexes (CCs) was performed on a representative
sample of 324 isolates.
RESULTS: A total of 1,960 GBS invasive infections was analysed from 2007 to 2019.
The median age at onset was 71 years old (range 18-103). The main manifestation
was bacteraemia without focus (54.5%). Meningitis was more frequent in patients
under 40 (26/180 (14.4%) vs. 78/1,780 (4.4%), P<0.0001). Capsular types Ia, Ib,
II, III and V accounted for 91.0% (1,786/1,960) of the cases. CC-1, 10, 17, 19
and 23 accounted for 96.3% (312/324) of the cases. Capsular type III and CC-17
were overrepresented in meningitis (38/104 (36.5%), P<0.001 and 22/104 (21.2%),
P=0.01, respectively). All isolates were susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. 
Resistance to erythromycin (32.7%) and clindamycin (26.3%) remained stable
whereas decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones increased, reaching 2.7% in 
2019 (P for trend=0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: This work highlights the susceptibility of the elderly to GBS
infections and differences in the clinical manifestations according to patients' 
age and GBS type. In agreement with worldwide reports on emerging multi-drug
resistant GBS, it reinforces the need for a continued surveillance of GBS
epidemiology.
