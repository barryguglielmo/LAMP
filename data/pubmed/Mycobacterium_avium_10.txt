Immunocompetent hosts with toxoplasmosis are usually asymptomatic. However, T.
gondii can present as an acute systemic infection. Symptomatic patients usually
have a benign, self-limited course that typically lasts from a few weeks to
months. Herein, we present a 66-year-old immunocompetent female who developed
dysphagia and new-onset cervical lymphadenopathy during pulmonary Mycobacterium
avium complex treatment.
