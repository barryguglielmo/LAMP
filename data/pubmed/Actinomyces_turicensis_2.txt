Actinomyces turicensis (A. turicensis) are normal commensals of the oral, gut,
vagina, and skin flora. Infection with these organisms is usually benign, and
bacteremia is rare. Here, we describe a case of an otherwise healthy female
patient presenting with renal calculi and life-threatening A. turicensis
bacteremia. The patient did not have any risk factors for A. turicensis
bacteremia. The patient developed multi-organ dysfunction syndrome and received a
biodegradable right ureter stent. The patient improved with urosurgical
intervention and appropriate antibiotic coverage.
