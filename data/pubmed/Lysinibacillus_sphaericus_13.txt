The natural estrogen 17β-estradiol (17β-E2) is a major endocrine disruptor.
Accordingly, due to their frequent presence in global surface waters, prolonged
exposure to estrogen-contaminated water may disrupt sexual development in
animals. It has adverse effects on wildlife and humans. To date, the most
effective strategy for estrogen removal from the environment is biodegradation
using microorganisms. To this end, we isolated a strain of Lysinibacillus
sphaericus, namely DH-B01, from a contraceptive factory in Beijing. The
experimental results revealed that the bacterium has a high capacity to degrade
estrogen, with a 17β-E2 degradation rate of about 97%, and produces the secondary
metabolite estrone. In addition, a series of genes involved in steroid metabolism
and stress response in L. sphaericus sp. DH-B01 were predicted, and several key
genes with high similarity to those of other strains were subjected to sequence
alignment to find their conserved regions. This is the first study of the ability
of L. sphaericus strains to degrade estrogens and the degradation mechanism
involved. This work advances the genomic study of estrogen-degrading strains and 
the study of bacterial estrogen degradation mechanisms. In this paper, a novel
bacterial strain capable of degrading 17β-E2 was studied. L. sphaericus sp.
DH-B01 can effectively degrade 17β-E2. During the degradation process, 17β-E2 can
be gradually metabolized to a substance without estrogen activity. By analyzing
the enzymatic reactions in the metabolic process, we found genes with high
similarity to reported 17β-HSD. L. sphaericus sp. DH-B01 was found to degrade
17β-E2. There are many types of bacteria that are currently being studied for the
degradation of estrogen, but L. sphaericus sp. DH-B01 is the only strain of L.
sphaericus that has been shown to degrade estrogen. This work advances the
genomic study of estrogen-degrading bacterial strains and the study of bacterial 
estrogen degradation mechanisms. Additionally, it explores the correlation
between different L. sphaericus strains. The differences play an important role
and further enrich the functionality and diversity of L. sphaericus strains. In
subsequent studies, the specificity of L. sphaericus sp. DH-B01 can be applied to
different environments for future environmental restoration.
