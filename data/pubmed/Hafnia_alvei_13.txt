OBJECTIVE: This study aims to detect the predominant bacteria in acute periapical
abscesses of primary teeth using culture-independent molecular methods based on
16S ribosomal DNA cloning.
METHODS: Purulent material was collected from nine children diagnosed with
abscesses of endodontic origin. DNA was extracted and the 16S rRNA gene amplified
with universal primer pairs 27F and 1492R. Amplified genes were cloned, sequenced
by Applied Biosystems, and identified by comparison with known 16S rRNA gene
sequences.
RESULTS: Bacterial DNA was present in all nine purulence samples. A total of 681 
clones were classified into 8 phyla, 78 genera, and 125 species/phylotypes. The
phyla were Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, Bacteroidetes,
Actinobacteria, Tenericutes, Deinococcus-Thermus, and Spirochaetes. The most
dominant genera were Streptococcus (13.3%), Fusobacterium (11.8%), Parvimonas
(7.8%), Prevotella (6.7%), Sphingomonas (5.8%), and Hafnia (5.2%). Fusobacterium 
nucleatum (11.5%), Parvimonas micra (7.8%), Streptococcus intermedius (6.6%),
Sphingomonas echinoides (5.3%), Hafnia alvei (5.2%), and Citrobacter freundii
(4.9%) were the most common species/phylotypes. Among these species/phylotypes,
F.nucleatum was the most prevalent (7/9). C. freundii, Carnobacterium
maltaromaticum, and H. alvei were seldom detected species in acute periapical
abscesses but had relatively high abundance and prevalence.
CONCLUSION: Acute periapical abscesses are polymicrobial with certain prevalent
bacteria, especially anaerobic bacterium. The most predominant and prevalent
bacteria of acute periapical abscesses in children was F. nucleatum.
