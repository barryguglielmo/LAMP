Kefir grains are a microbial consortium of different genera of bacteria and
yeasts. In this study, the performance of Tunisian Kefir grains during the
biological treatment of a mixture of Gouda cheese whey and white wastewaters
(GCW) in ratio 1:1 with very high organic matter concentration is investigated.
The biological process was evaluated and optimized through the response surface
methodology. Under the optimum conditions, Kefir grains concentration of 1.02%,
temperature at 36.68 °C, and incubation time of 5.14 days, the removal
efficiencies of COD, PO43-, and NO3- were 87, 37.48, and 39.5%, respectively.
Interestingly, the reusability tests of the grains proved not only their high
resistance to harsh environmental conditions but also their great potential for
more practical applications. Particularly, different strains were isolated from
the grains and identified as Kluyveromyces marxianus, Lactoccocus lactis,
Lactobacillus kefiri, and Bacillus spp. using 16S rDNA sequence analysis and
rep-PCR fingerprinting. At the biological level, the raw GCW (RGCW) has a
negative impact on the Hordeum vulgare both on seed germination, and on the
growth parameters of seedlings. Interestingly, after Kefir grains treatment, the 
treated GCW (TGCW) allow a seedlings growth and germination rate similar to those
soaked in water.
