This study investigated the antibacterial and in vitro antidementia effects of
aronia (Aronia melanocarpa) leaf extracts from 3 cultivars (Nero, Viking, and
McKenzie) collected at three different stages of maturity (young, harvest, and
old). Bacillus cereus was susceptible to the old leaves of cultivars McKenzie and
Nero, whereas Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Listeria
innocua were not inhibited by any of the extracts. Growth of B. cereus was
inhibited by cv. McKenzie, resulting in increased lag time, whereas Nero had both
an inhibitory and an inactivation effect. Except for cv. Viking at harvest stage,
the acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory activity of aronia 
leaf extracts were about 60-70 and 70-80%, respectively. Therefore, aronia leaf
is a natural resource with a potentially potent antidementia effect, besides
antibacterial activity.
