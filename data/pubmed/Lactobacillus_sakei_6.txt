This study investigated the effect of heat-killed Lactobacillus sakei HS-1 (HK-LS
HS-1) on the health and fecal bacteriological change of suckling Japanese Black
calves as a supplement in milk replacers. Twelve calves were separated from dams 
to calf-hatch after calving for milk replacers feeding. They were randomly
assigned to an HK-LS HS-1 supplement or a control without HK-LS HS-1 group in
milk replacers. HK-LS HS-1 was administered from separation day to 3 weeks. Blood
and fecal samples were examined. Two calves with a haptoglobin concentration of
>500 μg/ml on day 0 were excluded from the experiment, and 10 calves were finally
included. Glucose and vitamin A levels on day 7 were significantly higher
(P<0.05) in the supplement group than in the control group. No significant
differences were observed in haptoglobin or serum amyloid A between the groups.
The number of Escherichia coli in feces was lower in the control group than in
the supplement group on day 21 (P=0.06). No difference was observed in the number
of bifidobacteria, but that of lactic acid bacteria was significantly higher
(P<0.05) in the supplement group on day 21. The number of medications
administered was significantly lower (P<0.05) in the supplement group (5.2 ± 3.9)
than in the control group (10.6 ± 5.9) during the experimental period. The
results indicated that HK-LS HS-1 is potentially beneficial for improving
intestinal microbes and reducing the number of medical treatments.
