Longitudinal Changes in Skin Microbiome Associated with Change in Skin Status in 
Patients with Psoriasis.

Wang H, Chan WMM, Chan HH, Pang H.

The aim of this study was to identify key microbes associated with change in skin
status (lesional vs normal). Longitudinal changes in the skin microbiome between 
patients with psoriasis and healthy family controls living in the same household 
were studied using whole genome metagenomic shotgun sequencing at 4 time-points. 
There were significant changes in abundance of the pathogen Campylobacter jejuni 
and its higher taxonomic levels when the skin status of patients with psoriasis
changed. There were significant longitudinal variations in alpha diveristy
(p < 0.001) and beta diversity (p < 0.05) of the skin microbiome in patients with
psoriasis, but not in the healthy control group, which indicated composition of
skin microbiome in patients with psoriasis was different from health control and 
was dynamically less stable. This study will serve as the basis for future
temporal studies of the skin microbiome and probiotic therapeutics.
