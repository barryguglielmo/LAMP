BACKGROUND: Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis physiopathology likely involves
disturbed interactions between gut microbes and the host during the early
neonatal period. Our objective was to create a neonatal porcine model of
iatrogenic aganglionosis to evaluate the impact of the enteric nervous system
(ENS) on microbiota and intestinal barrier postnatal development.
METHODS: Under general anesthesia, the rectosigmoid serosa of 5-day-old suckling 
piglets was exposed to 0.5% benzalkonium chloride solution (BAC, n = 7) or saline
(SHAM, n = 5) for 1 h. After surgery, animals returned to their home-cage with
the sow and littermates and were studied 21 days later.
RESULTS: BAC treatment induced partial aganglionosis with absence of myenteric
plexus and reduced surface area of submucosal plexus ganglia (-58%, P < 0.05) in 
one third of the rectosigmoid circumference. Epithelial permeability of this zone
was increased (conductance +63%, FITC-dextran flux +386%, horseradish-peroxidase 
flux +563%, P < 0.05). Tight junction protein remodeling was observed with
decreased ZO-1 (-95%, P < 0.05) and increased claudin-3 and e-cadherin
expressions (+197% and 61%, P < 0.05 and P = 0.06, respectively). BAC piglets
harbored greater abundance of proinflammatory bacteria (Bilophila, Fusobacterium)
compared to SHAM in the rectosigmoid lumen.
CONCLUSIONS: This large animal model demonstrates that hypoganglionosis is
associated with dramatic defects of gut barrier function and establishment of
proinflammatory bacteria.
