Enzymes and protein's immobilization on magnetic nano supports is emerging as a
promising candidate in the food, medical field, and areas of environmental
studies. This work presents a study on purified Bacillus thermoamylovorans lipase
(BTL) by utilizing tetraethoxysilane (TEOS)-modified magnesium nano ferrite
(MgNF) of 20 nm size. Its structural and morphological studies were investigated 
by powder X-ray diffractometry, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy,
etc. Binding of BTL with MgNF was supported by using Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy. Magnetic behavior was examined by the vibrational sample
magnetometer and Mössbauer spectrometer graphs. The enzymatic activity of BTL
before and after immobilization was studied at different temperatures and
reaction time. As per the Lineweaver-Burk plot, immobilized lipase has more
biological affinity for fatty acids in comparison to the free lipase, and Kmax
values of immobilized and free BTL were computed as 6.6 and 7.5 mM respectively, 
with excellent reusability(> 50%) even till 13 consecutive assay runs. Graphical
