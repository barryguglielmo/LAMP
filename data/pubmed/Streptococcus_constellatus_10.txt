Objective: To clarify the clinical characteristics of chest infections caused by 
streptococcus anginosus group (SAG). Methods: A total of 26 patients diagnosed in
Affiliated Hospital of Jining Medical University from January 2014 to October
2019 were enrolled. The analyzed clinical data included baseline data, clinical
symptoms, imaging manifestations, therapies, and outcomes. The microbiological
diagnosis was established based on the specimens collected by lung needle biopsy,
bronchoscopy, artificial airway aspiration, thoracentesis or thoracoscopy.
Results: Among the 26 patients, there were 23 (88.5%) males and 3 (11.5%) females
aged (63.0±12.5) years, and 21 cases (80.8%) had potential diseases. The
distribution of clinical manifestations included 21 cases (80.8%) with fever, 13 
cases (50.0%) with pectoralgia, 13 cases (50.0%) with cough, and 13 cases (50.0%)
with expectoration. Chest CT displayed 18 cases (69.2%) with nodules, 18 cases
(69.2%) with pleural effusion, 17 cases (65.4%) with patchy shadows, 12 cases
(46.2%) with consolidation, 4 cases (15.4%) with cavity, 3 cases (11.5%) with
spontaneous pneumothorax. 13 cases (50.0%) of Streptococcus constellatus, 12
cases (46.2%) of Streptococcus anginosus and 1 case (3.8%) of Streptococcus
intermadius were observed through the bacterial culture. After anti-infection
treatment and invasive operation (including tracheoscopy, thoracoscopy, lung
puncture, and thoracic puncture drainage), the prognosis of 24 cases (92.3%)
became satisfactory, and 2 (7.7%) died. Conclusion: Pulmonary infection caused by
SAG is mainly seen in male patients with underlying diseases. No specificity is
displayed in clinical manifestations. CT manifestations usually show
intrapulmonary nodules, patchy shadows, consolidation and pleural effusion.

Publisher: 目的： 总结肺咽峡炎链球菌群致感染患者的临床特征。 方法：
回顾性分析2014年1月至2019年10月在济宁医学院附属医院26例确诊为咽峡炎链球菌群致肺部感染患者的临床资料，包括一般资料、临床症状、辅助检查、治疗及转归。微
生物学标本基于胸穿刺活检、支气管镜、人工气道吸引、胸腔穿刺术或胸腔镜检查时收集的。 结果：
26例患者中男23例（88.5%），女3例（11.5%），年龄（63.0±12.5）岁，有21例（80.8%）存在潜在疾病。临床主要表现为发热21例（80.8%）
、胸痛13例（50.0%）、咳嗽13例（50.0%）、咳痰13例（50.0%）。胸部CT主要表现为结节18例（69.2%）、胸腔积液18例（69.2%）、斑片影1
7例（65.4%）、实变影12例（46.2%）、空洞4例（15.4%）、气胸3例（11.5%）。微生物培养结果：星座链球菌13例（50.0%）、咽峡炎链球菌12例
（46.2%）、中间链球菌1例（3.8%）。患者经过抗感染及有创操作（包括气管镜、胸腔镜、肺穿刺及胸腔穿刺置管引流）治疗，24例（92.3%）预后良好，死亡2例（
7.7%）。 结论： 肺咽峡炎链球菌群感染患者主要见于患有基础疾病的男性患者，临床表现无特异性，CT显示常有以下征象：肺内结节、斑片、实变影及胸腔积液。.
