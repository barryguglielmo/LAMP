The objective of this study was to explore the correlation between bacterial
communities and volatile compounds in traditional dry sausages from different
regions in Northeast China. The bacterial community structure of dry sausages
from five different regions as determined by high-throughput sequencing
technology demonstrated that Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were the predominant
phyla; Lactobacillus, Staphylococcus, Leuconostoc, Lactococcus and Weissella were
the predominant genera; and Staphylococcus xylosus, Lactobacillus sakei,
Weissella hellenica, Leuconostoc citreum, Lactococcus raffinolactis and
Lactobacillus plantarum were the predominant species. Meanwhile, a total of 120
volatile compounds were detected in sausages from five different regions and
mainly included alcohols, acids, aldehydes, ketones, esters and terpenes.
Furthermore, the potential correlations between the core bacteria and major
volatile compounds (64) were explored based on Spearman's correlation analysis.
Positive correlations were found between W. hellenica, Lb. sakei, Lactococcus
lactis, Lactobacillus alimentarius, Lb. plantarum and carboxylic acids and
alcohols. Lc. lactis, Lb. alimentarius and Lb. plantarum were associated with the
production of most esters, aldehydes and ketones. This study provides a deep
insight into the relationship between the bacterial community and the volatile
flavour profile of dry sausages, which may be helpful for the production of
fermented dry sausages.
