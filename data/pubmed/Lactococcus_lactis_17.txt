It is well known that consumers are keen to try fermented milk products with
different flavors and starter cultures are important in determining the resulting
fermented dairy products. Here, we present the phenome of 227 Lactococcus lactis 
subsp. lactis isolates from traditionally fermented dairy products and the
selection of potential starter strains. Large-scale phenotyping revealed
significant technological diversity in fermentation characteristics amongst the
isolates including variation in fermentation time, viscosity, water holding
capacity (WHC) and free amino nitrogen (FAN) production. The 16 isolates with the
best fermentation characteristics were compared, in a sensory evaluation, with
the commercial starter Chr. Hansen R-704 as excellent fermentation
characteristics to identify potential starter isolates and find the isolate which
can product good flavors. From these, and from solid phase micro extraction
(SPME) - gas chromatography (GC)-mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, we identified
IMAU11823 and IMAU11919 as producing 3-methyl butanal and 3-methyl-2-butanone
which contribute to the malt aroma. This study expands the characterization of L.
lactis subsp. lactis phenotypic dataset and technological diversity and
identified isolates with potential culture starter in the fermentation industry.
