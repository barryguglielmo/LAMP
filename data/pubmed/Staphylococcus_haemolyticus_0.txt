Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered a promising new class of
anti-infectious agents. This study reports new antimicrobial peptides derived
from the Hirudo medicinalis microbiome identified by a computational analysis
method applied to the H. medicinalis metagenome. The identified AMPs possess a
strong antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria
(MIC range: 5.3 to 22.4 μM), including Staphylococcus haemolyticus, an
opportunistic coagulase-negative pathogen. The secondary structure analysis of
peptides via CD spectroscopy showed that all the AMPs except pept_352 have mostly
disordered structures that do not change under different conditions. For peptide 
pept_352, the α-helical content increases in the membrane environment. The
examination of the mechanism of action of peptides suggests that peptide pept_352
exhibits a direct membranolytic activity. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity assay
demonstrated that the nontoxic peptide pept_1545 is a promising candidate for
drug development. Overall, the analysis method implemented in the study may serve
as an effective tool for the identification of new AMPs.
