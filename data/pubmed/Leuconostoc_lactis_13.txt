Rebaudioside A was modified via glucosylation by recombinant dextransucrase of
Leuconostoc lactis EG001 in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), forming single
O-α-D-glucosyl-(1″→6') rebaudioside A with yield of 86%. O-α-D-glucosyl-(1″→6')
rebaudioside A was purified using HPLC and Diaion HP-20 and its properties were
characterized for possible use as a food ingredient. Almost 98% of
O-α-D-glucosyl-(1″→6') rebaudioside A was dissolved after 15 days of storage at
room temperature, compared to only 11% for rebaudioside A. Compared to
rebaudioside A, O-α-D-glucosyl-(1″→6') rebaudioside A showed similar or improved 
acidic or thermal stability in commercial drinks. Thus, O-α-D-glucosyl-(1″→6')
rebaudioside A could be used as a highly pure and improved sweetener with high
stability in commercial drinks. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The proposed method can be
used to generate glucosyl rebaudioside A by enzymatic glucosylation. Simple
glucosyl rebaudioside A exhibited high acid/thermal stability and improved
sweetener in commercialized drinks. This method can be applied to obtain high
value-added bioactive compounds by enzymatic modification.
