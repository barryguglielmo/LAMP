BACKGROUND: The composition of the bile acid (BA) pool is closely associated with
obesity and is modified by gut microbiota. Perturbations of gut microbiota shape 
the BA composition, which, in turn, may alter important BA signaling and affect
host metabolism.
METHODS: We investigated BA composition of high BMI subjects from a human cohort 
study and a high fat diet (HFD) obesity prone (HF-OP) / HFD obesity resistant
(HF-OR) mice model. Gut microbiota was analysed by metagenomics sequencing. GLP-1
secretion and gene regulation studies involved ELISA, qPCR, Western blot,
Immunohistochemistry, and Immunofluorescence staining.
FINDINGS: We found that the proportion of non-12-OH BAs was significantly
decreased in the unhealthy high BMI subjects. The HF-OR mice had an enhanced
level of non-12-OH BAs. Non-12-OH BAs including ursodeoxycholate (UDCA),
chenodeoxycholate (CDCA), and lithocholate (LCA) were decreased in the HF-OP mice
and associated with altered gut microbiota. Clostridium scindens was decreased in
HF-OP mice and had a positive correlation with UDCA and LCA. Gavage of
Clostridium scindens in mice increased the levels of hepatic non-12-OH BAs,
accompanied by elevated serum 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) levels. In HF-OP 
mice, altered BA composition was associated with significantly downregulated
expression of GLP-1 in ileum and PGC1α, UCP1 in brown adipose tissue. In
addition, we identified that UDCA attenuated the high fat diet-induced obesity
via enhancing levels of non-12-OH BAs.
INTERPRETATION: Our study highlights that dysregulated BA signaling mediated by
gut microbiota contributes to obesity susceptibility, suggesting modulation of
BAs could be a promising strategy for obesity therapy.
