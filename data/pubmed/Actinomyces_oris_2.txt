Adhesive pili in Gram-positive bacteria represent a variety of extracellular
multiprotein polymers that mediate bacterial colonization of specific host
tissues and associated pathogenesis. Pili are assembled in two distinct but
coupled steps, an orderly crosslinking of pilin monomers and subsequent anchoring
of the polymer to peptidoglycan, catalyzed by two transpeptidase enzymes - the
pilus-specific sortase and the housekeeping sortase. Here, we review this
biphasic assembly mechanism based on studies of two prototypical models, the
heterotrimeric pili in Corynebacterium diphtheriae and the heterodimeric pili in 
Actinomyces oris, highlighting some newly emerged basic paradigms. The disparate 
mechanisms of protein ligation mediated by the pilus-specific sortase and the
spatial positioning of adhesive pili on the cell surface modulated by the
housekeeping sortase are among the notable highlights.
