Weissella cibaria appears to have broad-spectrum health benefits. Here, we report
the genome sequence of Weissella cibaria strain BM2, which was isolated from
homemade kimchi; it consists of one circular chromosome of 2,462,443 bp and one
plasmid of 11,067 bp. A total of 2,337 coding sequences were predicted, including
2,117 protein-coding sequences and a G+C content of 45.06%.
