Introduction: There is increasing evidence linking periodontal infections to
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Saliva sampling can reveal information about the host
and pathogen interactions that can inform about physiological and pathological
brain states.
Methods: A cross-sectional cohort of age-matched participants (78) was segmented 
according to their chemosensory (University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification 
Test; UPSIT) and cognitive scores (Mini-Mental State Exam; MMSE and clinical
dementia rating; CDR). Mid-morning saliva was sampled from each participant and
processed for microbiome composition and cytokine analysis. Linear discriminant
analysis (LDA) was used to unravel specific changes in microbial and
immunological signatures and logistic regression analysis (LRA) was employed to
identify taxa that varied in abundance among patient groups.
Results: Using olfaction we distinguish in the cognitively normal population a
segment with high chemosensory scores (CNh, 27) and another segment with
chemosensory scores (CNr, 16) as low as mild cognitive impairment (MCI, 21) but
higher than the AD group (17). We could identify stage-specific microbial
signatures changes but no clearly distinct cytokine profiles. Periodontal
pathogen species as Filifactor villosus decline with the increasing severity of
AD, whereas opportunistic oral bacteria such as Leptotrichia wadei show a
significant enrichment in MCI.
Conclusions: The salivary microbiome indicates stage-dependent changes in oral
bacteria favoring opportunistic species at the expense of periodontal bacteria,
whereas the inflammatory profiles remain mainly unchanged in the sampled
population.
