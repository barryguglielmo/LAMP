Lactobacillus fermentum is found in food products and is generally considered
safe. L. fermentum AGR1485 promotes barrier integrity in Caco-2 cells and has
genetic similarities to other known probiotic L. fermentum strains. L. fermentum 
AGR1485 has potential as a probiotic and was sequenced to explore these probiotic
properties. The genome is a 2.2-Mbp circular chromosome with no plasmids and a GC
content of 51.15%.
