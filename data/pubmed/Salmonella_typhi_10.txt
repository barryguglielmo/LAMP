Background: Typhoid and paratyphoid fever remain a global public health burden,
yet annual estimates of prevalence vary. Estimates have ranged between 9.9 and
24.2 million cases annually. Similar differences in estimates are seen within
countries but point to a serious health challenge. In Ghana, for instance,
typhoid fever has been ranked among the top twenty causes of outpatient morbidity
and constituted 1.2%, 1.7% and 1.3% of hospital admissions in 2017, 2016 and 2015
respectively.
Objective: The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of
Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi in the Hohoe Municipality.
Methods: Data on all reported cases of typhoid fever in the Hohoe municipality as
entered into the District Health Information Management System 2 (DHIMS 2)
database between January 2012 and December 2016 were extracted. A time-trend
analysis was conducted to establish the relationship between typhoid fever
prevalence and factors such as age, gender, and season. Stata was used to analyse
data and to measure rates, associations, and their significance.
Findings: The results showed that a total of 6282 individuals suffered from
typhoid fever during the five-year period. Of these numbers, 2080 (33.1%) were
males, and 4202 (66.9%) were females, representing a P-value 0.0222, and 95% CI. 
The 25-29 age group were the most affected. High prevalence was observed during
the wet months, although cases occurred throughout the year. Trend analysis
showed growing cases of typhoid over the period. Prevalence for the various years
were found as follows: 2012 - 148 per 100,000, 2013 - 135 per 100,000, 2014 - 396
per 100,000 and in 2015 - 943 per 100,000.
Conclusions: Typhoid fever remains and continues to be a major public health
challenge in the municipality. This calls for health authorities and service
providers to educate the public about the disease if the challenge is to be
addressed.
