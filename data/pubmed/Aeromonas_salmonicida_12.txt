Growing global concerns about antibiotic resistance have generated a considerable
interest in the search for alternative environmental-friendly approaches. This
study was aimed to assess the antimicrobial activity of a multi-citrus
extract-based feed additive (Biocitro®) against some fish pathogens, as well as
evaluate its capacity to protect rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to
lactococcosis. A broth dilution method was used to determine the minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Biocitro®, and the results showed a strong
antibacterial activity against Aeromonas salmonicida, Lactococcus garvieae and
Yersinia ruckeri with MIC values of 2.0 µg/mL. Afterwards, rainbow trout
juveniles were fed a Biocitro®-enriched diet (750 mg/kg feed) at a daily rate of 
1.5% body weight for 4 weeks, then they were challenged with L. garvieae by the
cohabitation method. At the end of the experimental period, fish treated with
Biocitro® showed significantly (P < 0.001) improved protection against L.
garvieae compared to control fish. Although further studies are needed to
understand how Biocitro® increases rainbow trout resistance to L. garvieae, this 
feed additive could be considered as a useful alternative to chemotherapeutic
treatment in aquaculture.
