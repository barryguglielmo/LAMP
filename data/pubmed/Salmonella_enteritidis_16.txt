As a facultative intracellular pathogen, Salmonella Enteritidis must develop an
effective oxidative stress response to survive exposure to reactive oxygen
species within the host. To study this defense mechanism, we carried out a series
of oxidative stress assays in parallel with a comparative transcriptome analyses 
using a next generation sequencing approach. It was shown that the expression of 
45% of the genome was significantly altered upon exposure to H2O2. Quantitatively
the most significant (â‰¥100 fold) gene expression alterations were observed among 
genes encoding the sulfur utilization factor of Fe-S cluster formation and iron
homeostasis. Our data point out the multifaceted nature of the oxidative stress
response. It includes not only numerous mechanisms of DNA and protein repair and 
redox homeostasis, but also the key genes associated with osmotic stress,
multidrug efflux, stringent stress, decrease influx of small molecules, manganese
and phosphate starvation stress responses. Importantly, this study revealed that 
oxidatively stressed S. Enteritidis cells simultaneously repressed key motility
encoding genes and induced a wide range of adhesin- and salmonellae-essential
virulence-encoding genes, that are critical for the biofilm formation and
intracellular survival, respectively. This finding indicates a potential
intrinsic link between oxidative stress and pathogenicity in non-typhoidal
Salmonella that needs to be empirically evaluated.
