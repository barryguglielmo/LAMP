Halophiles are extremophilic microorganisms that grow optimally at high salt
concentrations by producing a myriad of equally halotolerant enzymes. Structural 
haloadaptation of these enzymes adept to thriving under high-salt environments,
though are not fully understood. Herein, the study attempts an in silico
investigation to identify and comprehend the evolutionary structural adaptation
of a halotolerant dehalogenase, DehHX (GenBank accession number: KR297065) of the
halotolerant Pseudomonas halophila, over its non-halotolerant counterpart, DehMX1
(GenBank accession number KY129692) produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. GC
content of the halotolerant DehHX DNA sequence was distinctively higher (58.9%)
than the non-halotolerant dehalogenases (55% average GC). Its acidic residues,
Asp and Glu were 8.27% and 12.06%, respectively, compared to an average 5.5% Asp 
and 7% Glu, in the latter; but lower contents of basic and hydrophobic residues
in the DehHX. The secondary structure of DehHX interestingly revealed a lower
incidence of Î±-helix forming regions (29%) and a higher percentage of coils
(57%), compared to 49% and 29% in the non-halotolerant homologues, respectively. 
Simulation models showed the DehHX is stable under a highly saline environment
(25% w/v) by adopting a highly negative-charged surface with a concomitant weakly
interacting hydrophobic core. The study thus, established that a halotolerant
dehalogenase undergoes notable evolutionary structural changes related to GC
content over its non-halotolerant counterpart, in order to adapt and thrive under
highly saline environments.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.
