Bacterial 5' untranslated regions of mRNA (UTR) involve in a complex regulation
of gene expression; however, the exact sequence features contributing to gene
regulation are not yet fully understood. In this study, we report the design of a
novel 5' UTR, dual UTR, utilizing the transcriptional and translational
characteristics of 5' UTRs in a single expression cassette. The dual UTR consists
of two 5' UTRs, each separately leading to either increase in transcription or
translation of the reporter, that are separated by a spacer region, enabling de
novo translation initiation. We rationally create dual UTRs with a wide range of 
expression profiles and demonstrate the functionality of the novel design concept
in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida using different promoter systems and
coding sequences. Overall, we demonstrate the application potential of dual UTR
design concept in various synthetic biology applications ranging from fine-tuning
of gene expression to maximization of protein production.
