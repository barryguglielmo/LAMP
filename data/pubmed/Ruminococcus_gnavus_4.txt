Paneth cells are the primary source of C-type lysozyme, a
β-1,4-N-acetylmuramoylhydrolase that enzymatically processes bacterial cell
walls. Paneth cells are normally present in human cecum and ascending colon, but 
are rarely found in descending colon and rectum; Paneth cell metaplasia in this
region and aberrant lysozyme production are hallmarks of inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD) pathology. Here, we examined the impact of aberrant lysozyme
production in colonic inflammation. Targeted disruption of Paneth cell lysozyme
(Lyz1) protected mice from experimental colitis. Lyz1-deficiency diminished
intestinal immune responses to bacterial molecular patterns and resulted in the
expansion of lysozyme-sensitive mucolytic bacteria, including Ruminococcus
gnavus, a Crohn's disease-associated pathobiont. Ectopic lysozyme production in
colonic epithelium suppressed lysozyme-sensitive bacteria and exacerbated
colitis. Transfer of R. gnavus into Lyz1-/- hosts elicited a type 2 immune
response, causing epithelial reprograming and enhanced anti-colitogenic capacity.
In contrast, in lysozyme-intact hosts, processed R. gnavus drove pro-inflammatory
responses. Thus, Paneth cell lysozyme balances intestinal anti- and
pro-inflammatory responses, with implications for IBD.
