Eggerthella lenta is an emerging and uncommon human pathogen that has been under 
recognized due to the limitations of phenotypic identification. Here we describe 
two cases of bacteremia caused by E. lenta and summarize the results of
antimicrobial susceptibility testing according to some previous literatures,
which illustrate the importance of identification and treatment of unusual
organisms. The most reliable antibiotic treatment options to E. lenta appear to
be metronidazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, carbapenems, vancomycin, cefoxitin,
chloramphenicol and clindamycin.
