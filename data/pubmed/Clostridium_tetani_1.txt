Tetanus is a disease caused by tetanotoxin produced in necrotic wounds by
Clostridium tetani. It is a very rare disease in Czechia due to successful and
effective population-wide vaccination programme, despite the fact that spores of 
C. tetani are permanently present in the environment. Groups with the highest
risk of clinical tetanus include elderly people, immunocompromised individuals,
residents of foreign origin with unclear vaccination history, and unvaccinated
children. We present four case studies of severe and mild form of tetanus, wound 
infection with the presence of C. tetani without the development of clinical
tetanus in a fully vaccinated individual, and unexpected risk of tetanus in an
unvaccinated child. Due to the rare occurrence of tetanus in Czechia, the
clinical awareness of the risk of tetanus decreases as well as the clinical
experience with diagnosis of early or mild forms of tetanus. Communication skills
during the management of contaminated wounds play a critical role in the decision
who should get tetanus anatoxin only and who should get antitetanus
immunoglobulin along with the active immunization by tetanus anatoxin. Key words:
etanus, Clostridium tetani, vaccination, postexposure prophylaxis, vaccine
hesitancy, contaminated wounds.
