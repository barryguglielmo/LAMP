Clostridium perfringens (Cp.) is the cause of human foodborne desease. Meat and
poultry products are identified as the main source of infection for humans. Cp.
can be found in poultry litter, feces, soil, dust, and healthy birds' intestinal 
contents. Cp. strains are known to secrete over 20 identified toxins and enzymes 
that could potentially be the principal virulence factors, capable of degrading
mucin, affecting enterocytes, and the small intestine epithelium, involved in
necrotic enteritis (NE) pathophysiology, also leading to immunological responses,
microbiota modification and anatomical changes. Different environmental and
dietary factors can determine the colonization of this microorganism. It has been
observed that the incidence of Cp-associated to NE in broilers has increased in
countries that have stopped using antibiotic growth promoters. Since the banning 
of such antibiotic growth promoters, several strategies for Cp. control have been
proposed, including dietary modifications, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics,
phytogenics, organic acids, and vaccines. However, there are aspects of the
pathology that still need to be clarified to establish better actions to control 
and prevention. This paper reviews the current knowledge about Cp. as foodborne
pathogen, the pathophysiology of NE, and recent findings on potential strategies 
for its control.
