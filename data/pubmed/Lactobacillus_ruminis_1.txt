Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is a major challenge in low-income countries and 
gut microbiota (GM) dysbiosis may play a role in its etiology. Here, we
determined the GM evolution during rehabilitation from SAM and the impact of
probiotics (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis
BB-12) supplementation. The GM (16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing) of children
admitted to hospital with SAM showed distinct composition over admission (e.g.
Klebsiella spp., and Enterobacteriaceae spp.), discharge (e.g. Clostridiaceae
spp., Veilonella dispar) and follow-up (e.g. Lactobacillus ruminis, Blautia spp.,
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii), reaching similar β- and α-diversity as healthy
individuals. Children with diarrhea had reduced distribution of Bacteroidaceae,
Lachnospiraceae, increased Enterobacteriaceae and Moraxellaceae, and lower
α-diversity. Children suffering from edematous SAM had diminished proportion of
Prevotellaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Ruminoccaceae and a higher α-diversity when
compared to non-edematous SAM. Supplementation of probiotics did not influence
β-diversity upon discharge or follow-up, but it increased (p < .05) the number of
observed species [SE: > 4.5]. Children where the probiotic species were detected 
had lower cumulative incidence (p < .001) of diarrhea during the follow-up period
compared to children receiving placebo and children receiving probiotics, but
where the probiotics were not detected. The GM of children with non-edematous and
edematous SAM differ in composition, which might have implications for future GM 
targeted treatments. Probiotics treatment reduced the cumulative incidence of
diarrhea during the outpatient phase, with the strongest effect in children where
the administered probiotics could be detected in the GM.
