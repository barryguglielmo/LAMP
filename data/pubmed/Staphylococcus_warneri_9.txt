Coagulase negative Staphylococci often grow in cultures and form one of the most 
abundant flora among skin microbiome. It is important and challenging to identify
and treat clinically significant infections caused by these organisms. Prosthetic
devices, catheters and conditions causing immunocompromised states are the risk
factors for such infections. We describe a case of clinically significant and
symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) in a 65-year-old man with liver
cirrhosis caused by Staphylococcus warneri which forms <1% of Staphylococcal skin
flora. He was treated successfully with fluoroquinolone antibiotic based on
culture results. It is important to understand potential of this organism to
cause serious infections which warrant culture-directed antibiotic therapy.
