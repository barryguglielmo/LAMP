CRISPR enzymes require a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) near the target
cleavage site, constraining the sequences accessible for editing. In the present 
study, we combine protein motifs from several orthologs to engineer two variants 
of Streptococcus canis Cas9-Sc++ and a higher-fidelity mutant HiFi-Sc++-that have
simultaneously broad 5'-NNG-3' PAM compatibility, robust DNA-cleavage activity
and minimal off-target activity. Sc++ and HiFi-Sc++ extend the use of CRISPR
editing for diverse applications.
