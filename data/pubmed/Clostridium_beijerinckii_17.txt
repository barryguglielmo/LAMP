Synthetic microbial communities have become a focus of biotechnological research 
since they can overcome several of the limitations of single-specie cultures. A
paradigmatic example is Clostridium cellulovorans DSM 743B, which can decompose
lignocellulose but cannot produce butanol. Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052
however, is unable to use lignocellulose but can produce high amounts of butanol 
from simple sugars. In our previous studies, both organisms were cocultured to
produce butanol by consolidated bioprocessing. However, such consolidated
bioprocessing implementation strongly depends on pH regulation. Since low pH (pH 
4.5-5.5) is required for butanol fermentation, C. cellulovorans cannot grow well 
and saccharify sufficient lignocellulose to feed both strains at a pH below 6.4. 
To overcome this bottleneck, this study engineered C. cellulovorans by adaptive
laboratory evolution, inactivating cell wall lyases genes (Clocel_0798 and
Clocel_2169), and overexpressing agmatine deiminase genes (augA, encoded by
Cbei_1922) from C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052. The generated strain WZQ36:
743B*6.0*3△lyt0798△lyt2169-(pXY1-Pthl -augA) can tolerate a pH of 5.5. Finally,
the alcohol aldehyde dehydrogenase gene adhE1 from Clostridium acetobutylicum
ATCC 824 was introduced into the strain to enable butanol production at low pH,
in coordination with solvent fermentation of C. beijerinckii in consortium. The
engineered consortium produced 3.94 g/L butanol without pH control within 83 hr, 
which is more than 5-fold of the level achieved by wild consortia under the same 
conditions. This exploration represents a proof of concept on how to combine
metabolic and evolutionary engineering to coordinate coculture of a synthetic
microbial community.
