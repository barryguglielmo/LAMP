This study aimed at determining the mechanisms of linezolid resistance and the
molecular characteristics of clinical Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2) and
coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 15) isolates obtained from four Spanish
hospitals. The detection of linezolid resistance mechanisms (mutations and
acquisition of resistance genes) was performed by PCR/sequencing. The
antimicrobial resistance and virulence profile was determined, and the isolates
were typed by different molecular techniques. Moreover, the genetic environment
of the cfr gene was determined by whole-genome sequencing. The cfr gene was
detected in one methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) that also displayed the
amino acid change Val118Ala in the ribosomal protein L4. The second S. aureus
isolate was methicillin susceptible and showed different alterations in the
ribosomal protein L4. All remaining linezolid-resistant Staphylococcus
epidermidis (n = 14) and Staphylococcus hominis isolates (n = 1) showed the
mutation G2576T (n = 14) or C2534T (n = 1) in the 23S rRNA. Moreover, different
amino acid changes were detected in the ribosomal proteins L3 and L4 in S.
epidermidis isolates. All S. epidermidis isolates belonged to the multilocus
sequence type ST2. Linezolid-resistant staphylococci (LRS) showed a
multiresistance phenotype, including methicillin resistance that was detected in 
all isolates but one, and was mediated by the mecA gene. The cfr gene in the MRSA
isolate was located together with the fexA gene on a conjugative 38,864 bp
plasmid. Linezolid- and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis ST2 showing
mutations in the 23S rRNA and in the ribosomal proteins L3 and L4 are spread
among Spanish hospitals, whereas LRS carrying acquired linezolid resistance genes
are rarely detected.
