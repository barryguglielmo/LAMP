Bitter gourd fruits contain high amounts of charantin, stigmasterol glucoside and
β-sitosterol glucoside, which have been shown to provide health benefits for
humans. However, the bitterness of the fruit means they are rarely consumed. This
study aimed to assess the effects of Lactobacillus plantarum fermentation, which 
has previously been reported to effectively reduce bitterness, on the contents of
these compounds. The current results suggest that Lactobacillus plantarum
fermentation should be considered as a potential approach to enhance the levels
of these compounds in bitter gourd juice.
