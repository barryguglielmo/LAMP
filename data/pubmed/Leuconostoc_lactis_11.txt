Glycosyltransferase-producing Leuconostoc lactis CCK940 produces CCK-
oligosaccharides, gluco-oligosaccharide molecules, using sucrose and maltose as
donor and acceptor molecules, respectively. In this study, the immunostimulatory 
activities of CCK-oligosaccharides on RAW264.7 macrophages and BALB/c mice were
evaluated. CCK-oligosaccharides induced the expression of phosphorylated-p38,
extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)
and upregulation of phagocytic activity in RAW264.7 macrophages, suggesting their
involvement in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and
phagocytosis. When CCK-oligosaccharides were administered to mice
intraperitoneally injected with cyclophosphamide (CY), spleen indices and
expressions of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-Î± increased, 
compared with those in only CY-treated group. These findings suggest that
CCK-oligosaccharides can be used as an effective immunostimulating agent.
