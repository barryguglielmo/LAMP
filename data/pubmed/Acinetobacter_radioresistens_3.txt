The effect of competition between isolated petroleum-degrading bacteria (PDB) and
indigenous compost microorganisms (ICM) on the efficiency of composting process
in bioremediation of petroleum waste sludge (PWS) was investigated. After
isolating two native PDB (Acinetobacter radioresistens strain KA5 and
Enterobacter hormaechei strain KA6) from PWS, their ability for growth and crude 
oil degradation was examined in the mineral-based culture (MBC). Then, the PDB
isolate were inoculated into the composting experiments and operated for 12
weeks. The results showed that the PDB degraded 21.65-68.73% of crude oil (1-5%) 
in the MBC after 7 days. The PDB removed 84.30% of total petroleum hydrocarbon
(TPHs) in the composting bioreactor containing the initial TPH level of
20 g kg-1. Removal of petroleum hydrocarbons (PHCs) in the composting experiments
proceeded according to the first-order kinetics. The computed values of
degradation rate constants and half-lives showed a better performance of the PDB 
than ICM for TPHs removal. This finding suggests that simultaneous application of
the PDB and ICM in the composting reactors resulted in a decline in the
effectiveness of the PDB which is due to competition between them. The study also
verified that the capability of PDB in degrading PHCs can be successfully
scaled-up from MBC to composting process.
