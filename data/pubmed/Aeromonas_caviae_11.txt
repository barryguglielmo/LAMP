BACKGROUND: Members of the genus Aeromonas are Gram-negative bacilli, belonging
to family Aeromonadaceae, and are widely found in various aquatic environments.
The most common species associated with human infections are A. hydrophila, A.
caviae, and A. veronii biovar sobria. Aeromonas species are recognized as
emerging opportunistic pathogens in humans mainly causing gastrointestinal
infections and wound infections with or without progression to septicaemia.
Aeromonas organisms rarely cause urinary tract infection (UTI) and are not known 
uropathogens.
CASE: We report a series of UTI due to Aeromonas species in three adult patients,
specifically identified as A. veronii biovar sobria in two patients and A.
hydrophila in one patient. Two patients had history of occupational exposure to
aquatic environment.
CONCLUSIONS: The cases highlight another expanded range of infections caused by
Aeromonas spp. that can be encountered in a community setting and indicate that
infections with Aeromonas spp. should be kept in mind while investigating for the
etiology of UTI, especially in adult patients with occupational exposure to
aquatic ecosystems.
