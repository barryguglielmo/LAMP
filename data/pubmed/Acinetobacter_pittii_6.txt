Surgical site infection is a relatively common and devastating complication
following pediatric orthopedic surgery. Many infections have been determined to
be the result of settled airborne particles on surgical equipment and the sterile
field. Fiberglass casts are commonly used orthopedic fixation devices before and 
after surgery; however, fiberglass casting material is expelled during the
removal process and represents an uninvestigated area for the possibility of cast
saw dust as a source of airborne bacterial contamination in an operating room
setting. This study evaluates the prevalence and distribution of microbiota on 90
pediatric casts by collecting and culturing fiberglass cast material from 90
pediatric casts. Bacterial identification was performed using a Bruker Biotyper
Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry
device. 81 out of 90 casts (90%) showed evidence of microbial contamination.
Isolated species were very diverse and ranged from normal skin flora to
opportunistic pathogens. The 5 most commonly isolated organisms were
Acinetobacter pittii, Enterobacter cloacae, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus
epidermidis, and Staphylococcus hominis. Further investigation is required to
determine if casting material is truly a cause of surgical site infection.
