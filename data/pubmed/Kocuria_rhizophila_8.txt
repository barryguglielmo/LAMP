Two-component systems (TCSs) are highly conserved in prokaryotes, endowing cells 
with multiple physiological functions to respond to changes in the ambient
environment. The signaling pathway of a typical TCS consists of a sensory
histidine kinase and a response regulator. The TCSs of Kocuria rhizophila, which 
is usually used as a target strain for various antibiotics and other adverse
factors, have captured our interest due to their potential roles in bacterial
adaptation for survival. Herein, the distribution and putative biological
functions of the TCSs of K. rhizophila DC2201 were analyzed by using
bioinformatics, and a preliminary TCS regulatory network was constructed. A
representative and important TCS (i.e., HK8700-RR8701 system), which is
homologous to the LiaS-LiaR system previously discovered in Bacillus subtilis,
was identified and characterized through yeast two-hybrid screening and
phosphorylation assays. Detailed information of TCSs is expected to offer novel
insights into the adaptation mechanism of K. rhizophila and thus boost its
application.
