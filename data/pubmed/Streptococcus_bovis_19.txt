Streptococcus spp. cause a wide range of diseases in animals and humans. A
Streptococcus strain (FMD1) was isolated from forest musk deer lung. To identify 
the bacterium at the species level and investigate its pathogenicity, whole
genome sequencing and experimental infections of mice were performed. The genome 
had 97.63% average nucleotide identity with the S. equinus strain. Through
virulence gene analysis, a beta-hemolysin/cytolysin genome island was found in
the FMD1 genome, which contained 12 beta-hemolysin/cytolysin-related genes.
Hemolytic reaction and histopathological analysis established the strain's
pathogenicity in mice. This is the first report of a beta-hemolytic S. equinus
strain in forest musk deer identified based on phenotypic and genotypic analyzes;
this strategy could be useful for analyzing pathogens affecting rare animals.
