It is now abundantly clear that our microbiota (commensals) are critical for many
physiological and developmental processes. They have also been shown to inhibit
pathogen colonization, through a variety of means including nutrient competition 
and secretion of microbicidal or biofilm-inhibiting proteins/peptides. Our recent
study, Kim et al., (2019), adds a new dimension to the concept of commensal
protection. It shows that commensal Neisseria kill the closely related pathogen
N. gonorrhoeae through an unexpected mechanism, one that involves genetic
competence, DNA methylation state and recombination. This microreview summarizes 
the report and discusses questions and lines of research arising from the study. 
Further investigation into this DNA-based killing mechanism will provide a better
understanding of Neisseria biology and commensal-pathogen interactions on the
mucosa, and identify strategies for preventing pathogenic Neisseria transmission.
