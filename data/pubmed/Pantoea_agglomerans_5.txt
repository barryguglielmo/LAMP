Linalool is a monoterpene alcohol, which imparts floral scents to a variety of
plants and is extensively used in various kinds of products, such as processed
foods and beverages for fragrances and flavors. However, linalool from natural
resources is racemate, and production of linalool enantiomers is difficult. To
produce stereospecific linalool, we evaluated linalool synthase genes (LINS) from
plants, such as Actinidia arguta (AaLINS) and Coriandrum sativum (CsLINS) for
(S)-specific LINS and a gram-positive bacterium Streptomyces clavuligerus
(ScLINS) for (R)-specific LINS, with Pantoea ananatis strain as the host. Among
the 16 LINS examined, AaLINS and ScLINS showed the best (S)-linalool production
and (R)-linalool production, respectively, with 100 % enantio excess.
Co-expression of the mutated farnesyl diphosphate synthase gene, ispA* (S80 F),
from Escherichia coli along with the LINS genes also improved linalool
production. In order to prevent volatilization and cell toxicity of linalool,
two-phase cultivation with isopropyl myristate was done, which had positive
effects on linalool production. The carbon flux to the MVA pathway from glucose
was increased by inactivating a membrane-bound glucose dehydrogenase. Overall,
5.60 g/L (S)-linalool and 3.71 g/L (R)-linalool were produced from 60.0 g/L
glucose by introduction of AaLINS-ispA* and ScLINS-ispA* in P. ananatis,
respectively.
