BACKGROUND: The present study examines the antimicrobial activity of nasturtium
herb (Tropaeoli maji herba) and horseradish root (Armoraciae rusticanae radix)
against clinically important oral bacterial pathogens involved in periodontitis, 
gingivitis, pulpitis, implantitis and other infectious diseases.
METHODS: A total of 15 oral pathogens, including members of the genera
Campylobacter, Fusobacterium, Prevotella, Parvimonas, Porphyromonas, Tanerella,
Veillonella, and HACEK organisms, were exposed to [1] a combination of herbal
nasturtium and horseradish using a standardized gas test and [2] a mixture of
synthetic Isothiocyantes (ITCs) using an agardilution test. Headspace gas
chromatography mass spectrometry was employed to quantify the amount of allyl-,
benzyl-, and 2- phenyl- ethyl-ITC.
RESULTS: With exception of Veillonella parvula, all tested species were highly
susceptible to herbal nasturtium and horseradish in the gas test with minimal
inhibitory concentrations (MICs) between 50/20 mg and 200/80 mg and to synthetic 
ITCs in the agardilution with MICs between 0.0025 and 0.08 mg ITC/mL,
respectively. Minimal bactericidal concentrations extended from 0.005 mg ITC/mL
to 0.34 mg ITC/mL.
CONCLUSIONS: ITCs may be considered an interesting alternative to antibiotics for
prevention and treatment of oropharyngeal infections, periodontitis and related
diseases. Furthermore, the suitability of ITCs for endocarditis prophylaxis in
dental procedures might be worth further investigation.
