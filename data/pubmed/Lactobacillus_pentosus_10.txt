This research determined the concentration of trehalose, xylose and l-citrulline 
in fresh and fermented cucumbers and their utilization by Lactobacillus pentosus,
Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis and Lactobacillus buchneri.
Targeted compounds were measured by HPLC and the ability of the lactobacilli to
utilize them was scrutinized in fermented cucumber juice. Fresh cucumber juice
was supplemented with trehalose, xylose and l-citrulline to observed mixed
culture fermentations. Changes in the biochemistry, pH and colony counts during
fermentations were monitored. Trehalose, xylose and l-citrulline were detected in
fermentations to15.51 ± 1.68 mM, a fresh cucumber sample at 36.05 mM and in fresh
and fermented cucumber samples at 1.05 ± 0.63 mM, respectively. Most of the LAB
tested utilized trehalose and xylose in FCJM at pH 4.7. l-citrulline was utilized
by L. buchneri and produced by other LAB. l-citrulline (12.43 ± 2.3 mM) was
converted to ammonia (14.54 ± 3.60 mM) and the biogenic amine ornithine
(14.19 ± 1.07 mM) by L. buchneri at pH 4.7 in the presence of 0.5 ± 0.2 mM
glucose enhancing growth by 0.5 log CFU/mL. The use of a mixed starter culture
containing L. buchneri aided in the removal of l-citrulline and enhanced the
fermentation stability. The utilization of l-citrulline by L. buchneri may be a
cause of concern for the stability of cucumber fermentations at pH 3.7 or above. 
This study identifies the use of a tripartite starter culture as an enhancer of
microbial stability for fermented cucumbers.
