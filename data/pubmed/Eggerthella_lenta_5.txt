Despite the remarkable microbial diversity found within humans, our ability to
link genes to phenotypes is based upon a handful of model microorganisms. We
report a comparative genomics platform for Eggerthella lenta and other
Coriobacteriia, a neglected taxon broadly relevant to human health and disease.
We uncover extensive genetic and metabolic diversity and validate a tool for
mapping phenotypes to genes and sequence variants. We also present a tool for the
quantification of strains from metagenomic sequencing data, enabling the
identification of genes that predict bacterial fitness. Competitive growth is
reproducible under laboratory conditions and attributable to intrinsic growth
rates and resource utilization. Unique signatures of in vivo competition
in gnotobiotic mice include an adhesin enriched in poor colonizers. Together,
these computational and experimental resources represent a strong foundation for 
the continued mechanistic dissection of the Coriobacteriia and a template that
can be applied to study other genetically intractable taxa.
