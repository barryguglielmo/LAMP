Inflammatory responses stimulated by Propionibacterium acnes have been shown to
be major etiological factors in the pathogenesis of acne. Scutellaria
baicalensis, a popular traditional Chinese medicine, has been widely shown to
have anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, primary component analysis and
primary effective component analysis were conducted. The results showed that
wogonin (1.15 mg/g S. baicalensis extract) possessed better anti-acne effects
than wogonoside (8.71 mg/g S. baicalensis extract) in inhibiting the
up-regulation of IL-1β and IL-8 level caused by P. acnes via inactivation of the 
MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways. To enhance the anti-acne effects of
S. baicalensis extract, an environmentally friendly and healthy plant
fermentation strategy was used to efficiently convert glycoside-type constituents
into bioactive aglycone. S. baicalensis extract was fermented by symbiotic fungus
Penicillium decumbens f3-1 to transform wogonoside into wogonin with a conversion
rate of 91.0% after 4 days. Fermented S. baicalensis extract (FSE) showed higher 
potential anti-acne effects than non-fermented S. baicalensis extract (NSE) by
inhibiting the up-regulation of IL-1β and IL-8. Thus, P. decumbens-fermented
S. baicalensis Extract may be used for developing new anti-acne cosmetic
ingredients.
