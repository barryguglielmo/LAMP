Acetobacter pasteurianus 386B is a candidate functional starter culture for the
cocoa bean fermentation process. To allow in silico simulations of its related
metabolism in response to different environmental conditions, a genome-scale
metabolic model for A. pasteurianus 386B was reconstructed. This is the first
genome-scale metabolic model reconstruction for a member of the genus
Acetobacter. The metabolic network reconstruction process was based on extensive 
genome re-annotation and comparative genomics analyses. The information content
related to the functional annotation of metabolic enzymes and transporters was
placed in a metabolic context by exploring and curating a Pathway/Genome Database
of A. pasteurianus 386B using the Pathway Tools software. Metabolic reactions and
curated gene-protein-reaction associations were bundled into a genome-scale
metabolic model of A. pasteurianus 386B, named iAp386B454, containing 454 genes, 
322 reactions, and 296 metabolites embedded in two cellular compartments. The
reconstructed model was validated by performing growth experiments in a defined
medium, which revealed that lactic acid as the sole carbon source could sustain
growth of this strain. Further, the reconstruction of the A. pasteurianus 386B
genome-scale metabolic model revealed knowledge gaps concerning the metabolism of
this strain, especially related to the biosynthesis of its cell envelope and the 
presence or absence of metabolite transporters.
