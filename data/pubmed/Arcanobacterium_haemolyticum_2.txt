We report the case of a twenty-year-old immunocompetent male patient presenting
to the emergency room with pharyngitis and fever. Blood cultures were drawn and
Arcanobacterium haemolyticum (rough biotype) was recovered. The presence of the
arcanolysin gene was investigated at the molecular level and the upstream region 
was amplified and sequenced in order to correlate it with the smooth or rough
biotype. Although the isolate was susceptible to penicillin, vancomycin and
gentamicin, empirical treatments first with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (1g/12h) 
and then with ceftriaxone (1g/12h) failed and the infection evolved to sepsis.
Finally, treatment with vancomycin (1g/12h) plus piperacillin/tazobactam
(4.5g/8h) was effective. Lemierre's syndrome was ruled out. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first case of bacteremia by A. haemolyticum reported in
Argentina.
