BACKGROUND: Hospital drains may be an important reservoir for
carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE).
AIM: To determine prevalence of CPE in hospital drains exposed to in-patients
with CPE, relatedness of drain and patient CPE, and risk factors for drain
contamination.
METHODS: We cultured sink and shower drains in patient rooms and communal shower 
rooms exposed to 310 in-patients with CPE colonization/infection at 10 hospitals.
Using short- and long-read whole-genome sequencing, in-patient and corresponding 
drain CPE were compared. Risk factors for drain contamination were assessed using
multi-level modelling.
FINDINGS: Of 1,209 exposed patient room and communal shower room drains, 53 (4%) 
yielded 62 CPE isolates in 7 (70%) hospitals. Of 49 CPE isolates in patient room 
drains, 4 (8%) were linked to prior room occupants. Linked drain/room occupant
pairs included Citrobacter freundii ST18 isolates separated by 8 single
nucleotide variants (SNVs), related blaKPC-containing IncN3-type plasmids
(different species), related blaKPC-3-containing IncN-type plasmids (different
species), and related blaOXA-48-containing IncL/M-type plasmids (different
species). In one hospital, drain isolates from 8 rooms on 2 units were
Enterobacter hormaechei separated by 0-6 SNVs. Shower drains were more likely to 
be CPE-contaminated than hand hygiene (OR 3.45, 95%CI 1.66-7.16) or patient use
(OR 13.0, 95%CI 4.29-39.1) sink drains. Hand hygiene sink drains were more likely
to be CPE-contaminated than patient use sink drains (OR 3.75, 95%CI 1.17-12.0).
CONCLUSION: Drain contamination was uncommon but widely dispersed. Drain CPE
unrelated to patient exposure suggests contamination by undetected colonized
patients or retrograde (drain-to-drain) contamination. Drain types had different 
contamination risks.
