In the present study, a novel extracellular laccase isolated from Geobacillus
stearothermophilus ATCC 10149 was entrapped in a bionanocomposite matrix
consisting of copper alginate (Cu-alginate) supplemented with the nanoclay
bentonite. After optimization, this nanobiocatalyst was able to degrade up to 90%
of Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR) without the addition of redox mediators and
retained 70% of its initial activity for at least 1440 h, equivalent to more than
288 uses. The incorporation of nanoclay allowed alginate beads to be used in
alkaline pH and strengthened its mechanical properties. Besides, this
thermophilic laccase was able to decolorize other structurally different
synthetic dyes such as Methyl Orange, Malachite Green and Indigo Carmine. These
preliminary results suggested that the nanobiocatalyst could be a suitable option
for dye decolorization and be further developed for large scale bioremediation of
toxic dyes.
