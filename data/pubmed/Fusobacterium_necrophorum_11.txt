BACKGROUND: Infectious mononucleosis (IM) develops after primary infection with
Epstein-Barr virus. We report a case of septic shock from pelvic inflammatory
disease caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum in an adolescent after sexual
intercourse during recovery from IM.
CASE: A 17-year-old girl with a 7-day history of fever was diagnosed with IM.
During follow-up, she developed lower abdominal pain and high fever after sexual 
intercourse and was transferred to our hospital. She was in shock and had a right
ovarian abscess. Emergency laparotomy, drainage, and right adnexectomy were
performed. F necrophorum was subsequently detected in blood and abscess cultures.
