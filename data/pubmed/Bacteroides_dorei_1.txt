A beneficial gut Bacteroides-folate-liver pathway regulating lipid metabolism is 
demonstrated. Oral administration of a Ganoderma meroterpene derivative (GMD)
ameliorates nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis in the liver of fa/fa rats by reducing
endotoxemia, enhancing lipid oxidation, decreasing de novo lipogenesis, and
suppressing lipid export from the liver. An altered gut microbiota with an
increase of butyrate and folate plays a causative role in the effects of GMD. The
commensal bacteria Bacteroides xylanisolvens, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron,
Bacteroides dorei, and Bacteroides uniformis, which are enriched by GMD, are
major contributors to the increased gut folate. Administration of live
B. xylanisolvens reduces hepatic steatosis and enhances the folate-mediated
signaling pathways in mice. Knockout of the folate biosynthetic folp gene in
B. xylanisolvens blocks its folate production and beneficial effects. This work
confirms the therapeutic potential of GMD and B. xylanisolvens in alleviating
nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis and provides evidence for benefits of the gut
Bacteroides-folate-liver pathway.
