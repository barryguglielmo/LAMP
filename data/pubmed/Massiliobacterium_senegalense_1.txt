Laparoscopic port-site infections, though infrequent, undermine the advantages
provided by minimally invasive surgeries. Persistent nonhealing discharging
sinuses, not responding to conventional antibiotic therapy, pose diagnostic and
therapeutic challenges. Sizeable number of these infections is caused by rapidly 
growing nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), and diagnosing these requires a high
index of suspicion. We present a case of a nonhealing laparoscopic
cholecystectomy umbilical port-site infection caused by Mycobacterium
senegalense, a rare NTM. The patient recovered completely after 6 months of
combination therapy with clarithromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and
levofloxacin.
