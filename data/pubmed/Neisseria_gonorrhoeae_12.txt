We report the case of an 18-year-old male patient who presented for the
evaluation of bilateral conjunctivitis, blurry vision of the left eye, penile
lesions, and dysuria. The patient was admitted to the hospital due to widespread 
mucosal lesions and signs of disseminated infection. Laboratory studies revealed 
a leukocytosis of 17.41K/µL (normal: 4K/µL - 11K/µL) with a neutrophilic
predominance of 82.7%. Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), antinuclear antibody (ANA), hepatitis, human
leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27), and pathergy test for Behcet's were all
negative. Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM and IgG, herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) IgG
and IgM, and HSV-2 IgG were all positive. It was determined that the cause for
his lesions was likely Mycoplasma mucositis. He was treated with ceftriaxone,
azithromycin, acyclovir, and methylprednisolone. After five days of treatment,
complete resolution of symptoms was achieved and he was discharged home.
