Whole genome sequences of four bacterial strains Dietzia maris SST1, Pseudomonas 
zhaodongensis SST2, Pseudomonas sp. SST3 and Halomonas sulfidaeris SST4,
recovered from the South Shetland Trench sediment in Antarctica were analyzed
using Ion Torrent sequencing technology. The respective sizes of their genomes
(3.88, 4.99, 5.60 and 4.25 Mb) and GC contents (70.0, 60.3, 59.9 and 53.8%) are
in agreement with these values of other strains of the species. The bacterial
strains displayed promising antimicrobial activity against a number of pathogenic
bacterial and fungal species. Whole genomes have been assembled and biosynthetic 
gene clusters (BGCs) have been identified using the antibiotics and Secondary
Metabolite Analysis Shell (antiSMASH) web platform. Comparative analysis of the
genome sequences revealed that the strains host abundant BGCs encoding for
terpenes, siderophores, arylpolyene, bacteriocins, and lassopeptides.
Furthermore, the key stress-related genes were identified and their distribution 
provided an insight into how these isolates adapt to key marine environmental
conditions. This comprehensive study is a contribution to understanding the
nature of life on the deep-sea environments.
