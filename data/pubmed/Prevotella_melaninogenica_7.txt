Co-infection between Helicobacter pylori (Hp) and groups of periodontal pathogens
may alter the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and all-cause dementia. We
examined the interactive associations among Hp sero-positivity, periodontal
disease (Pd), and infections with incident AD and all-cause dementia, among older
adults (â‰¥65 years at baseline). Up to 1431 participants from phase 1 of the
National Health and Nutrition Survey III (1988-1991) had complete data till
January 1st, 2014 on Hp sero-positivity with a mean follow-up of 10-11 years for 
AD and all-cause dementia incidence. Exposures consisted of 19 periodontal
pathogens, constructed factors and clusters, and two Pd markers- probing depth
and clinical attachment loss (CAL). Cox proportional hazards models were
performed. Around 55% of the selected sample was Hp+. We found that Prevotella
intermedia, Campylobacter Rectus, Factor 2 (Pi/Prevotella nigrescens/Prevotella
melaninogenica), and the Orange-Red cluster interacted synergistically with Hp
sero-positivity, particularly with respect to AD incidence. The presence of
higher levels of Actinomyces Naeslundii (An) enhanced the effect of being Hp+ on 
both AD and all-cause dementia incidence. In contrast, Fusobacterim nucleatum
(Fn), and Factor 1 (which included Fn), exhibited an antagonistic interaction
with Hp in relation to all-cause dementia. Both probing depth and CAL had direct 
associations with all-cause dementia among Hp+ individuals, despite
nonsignificant interaction. Selected periodontal pathogen titers, factors, and
clusters interacted mostly synergistically, with Hp sero-positivity, to alter the
risk of AD and all-cause dementia. Ultimately, a randomized controlled trial is
needed, examining effects of co-eradication of Hp and select periodontal
pathogens on neurodegenerative disease.
