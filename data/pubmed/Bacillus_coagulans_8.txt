Obesity is a worldwide epidemic characterized by excessive fat accumulation,
associated with multiple comorbidities and complications. Emerging evidence
points to gut microbiome as a driving force in the pathogenesis of obesity.
Vinegar intake, a traditional remedy source of exogenous acetate, has been shown 
to improve glycemic control and to have anti-obesity effects. New functional
foods may be developed by supplementing traditional food with probiotics. B.
coagulans is a suitable choice because of its resistance to high temperatures. To
analyze the possible synergic effect of Vinegar and B. coagulans against the
metabolic alterations induced by a high fat diet (HFD), we fed twelve-week-old
C57BL/6 mice with HFD for 5 weeks after 2 weeks of acclimation on a normal diet. 
Then, food intake, body weight, blood biochemical parameters, histology and liver
inflammatory markers were analyzed. Although vinegar drink, either alone or
supplemented with B. coagulans, reduced food intake, attenuated body weight gain 
and enhanced glucose tolerance, only the supplemented drink improved the lipid
serum profile and prevented hepatic HFD-induced overexpression of CD36, IL-1β,
IL-6, LXR and SREBP, thus reducing lipid deposition in the liver. The beneficial 
properties of the B. coagulans-supplemented vinegar appear to be mediated by a
reduction in insulin and leptin circulating levels.
