Pectin exists in significant amounts in vegetables and fruits as a component of
the plant cell wall. In human diet, pectin is not degraded by the human digestive
enzymes due to its complex structure; only gut bacteria degrade pectin in the
large intestine. To date, although pectin is one of the most important sources of
dietary fiber in human diet, there have been only few reports on human
gut-originated pectinolytic bacteria. In this study, the strain Enterococcus
mundtii Pe103, a bacterium with pectin-degrading activity, was isolated from the 
feces of a healthy Korean adult female. Culture experiments revealed that it
could grow on pectin as the sole carbon source by degrading pectin to
approximately 35% within 13Â h. We report the complete genome data of human gut E.
mundtii Pe103. It consists of a circular chromosome (3,084,146 bps) and two
plasmids (63,713 and 56,223 bps). Genomic analysis suggested that at least nine
putative enzymes related to pectin degradation are present in E. mundtii Pe103.
These enzymes may be involved in the degradation of pectin. The whole genome
information of E. mundtii Pe103 could improve the understanding of the mechanism 
underlying the degradation of pectin by human gut microbiota.
