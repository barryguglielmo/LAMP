In this study, the effect of sustainable probiotics on Campylobacter jejuni
colonization and gut microbiome composition was evaluated using chicken as a
model organism. Chickens were given Lactobacillus casei over-expressing
myosin-cross-reactive antigen (LC+mcra). LC+mcra can generate bioactive compounds
in larger quantity including conjugated linoleic acid. A total of 120 chickens
were used in duplicate trials to investigate the effectiveness of LC+mcra in
decreasing C. jejuni colonization by means of kanamycin resistant strain compared
to the control group. We observed that LC+mcra can efficiently colonize various
parts of the chicken gut and competitively reduce colonization of natural and
challenged C. jejuni and natural Salmonella enterica. LC+mcra was found to reduce
C. jejuni colonization in cecum, ileum and jejunum, by more than one log CFU/g
when compared to the no-probiotic control group. Furthermore, 16S rRNA
compositional analysis revealed lower abundance of Proteobacteria, higher
abundance of Firmicutes, along with enriched bacterial genus diversity in gut of 
LC+mcra fed chicken. Decreased contamination of drinking water by C. jejuni and
S. enterica was also observed, suggesting a potential function of reducing
horizontal transfer of enteric bacteria in poultry. Outcomes of this study reveal
high potential of LC+mcra as sustainable approach to decrease colonization of C. 
jejuni and S. enterica in poultry gut along with other beneficial attributes.
