Since the publication of the 2014 European Society for Paediatric
Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition Working Group (WG) on Probiotics and 
Prebiotics guidelines for the management of acute gastroenteritis (AGE), new
evidence concerning the efficacy of probiotics has become available. This
document provides updated recommendations on the use of probiotics for the
treatment of AGE in previously presumed healthy infants and children. A
systematic literature search was performed. All pooled analyses were explicitly
performed for the current report. The WG graded the recommendations and assessed 
the certainty of the supporting evidence using the Grading of Recommendations,
Assessment Development, and Evaluations tool. The recommendations were formulated
if at least 2 randomized controlled trials that used a given probiotic were
available. Despite the large number of identified trials, the WG could not
identify 2 randomized controlled trial of high quality for any strain that
provided benefit when used for treating AGE. The WG made weak recommendations for
(in descending order in terms of the number of trials evaluating any given
strain): Saccharomyces boulardii (low to very low certainty of evidence);
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (very low certainty of evidence); L reuteri DSM 17938 
(low to very low certainty of evidence); and L rhamnosus 19070-2 and L reuteri
DSM 12246 (very low certainty of evidence). The WG made a strong recommendation
against L helveticus R0052 and L rhamnosus R0011 (moderate certainty of evidence)
and a weak recommendation against Bacillus clausii strains O/C, SIN, N/R, and T
(very low certainty of evidence).
