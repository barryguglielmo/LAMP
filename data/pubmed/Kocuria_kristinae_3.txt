BACKGROUND: Adult retropharyngeal abscess (RPA) is extremely rare, and most cases
reported in the literature were related to tuberculous infection. We present a
case of RPA with acute airway obstruction as the main manifestation in a
66-year-old woman that was considered to be non-tubercular suppurative
inflammation in the retropharyngeal space.
CASE SUMMARY: A 66-year-old woman complaining of chills and fever was admitted to
our hospital. She was initially diagnosed with an acute upper respiratory tract
infection. She lost consciousness twice during hospitalization. She regained
consciousness immediately upon emergency tracheal intubation. Acute upper airway 
obstruction was suspected as arterial blood gas analysis showed obvious acute
retention of carbon dioxide before the second tracheal intubation. The diagnosis 
of RPA was confirmed by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.
Kocuria kristinae was isolated from blood samples taken from both hands. The
patient recovered and was subsequently discharged after receiving antibiotic
therapy together with surgical incision and drainage of the abscess.
CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of RPA in patients with
acute airway obstruction. Surgical incision and drainage is an effective
treatment for RPA.
