The first documented nosocomial outbreak caused by Serratia marcescens in Spain
occurred in 1969 at the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of the tertiary La
Paz Children's Hospital in Madrid, Spain, and based on the available phenotyping 
techniques at this time, it was considered as a monoclonal outbreak. Only 47
years later, another S. marcescens outbreak of an equivalent dimension occurred
at the same NICU. The aim of the present study was to study isolates from these
historical and contemporary outbreaks by phenotypic analysis and whole-genome
sequencing techniques and to position these strains along with 444 publicly
available S. marcescens genomes, separately comparing core genome and accessory
genome contents. Clades inferred by both approaches showed high correlation,
indicating that core and accessory genomes seem to evolve in the same manner for 
S. marcescens. Nine S. marcescens clusters were identified, and isolates were
grouped in two of them according to sampling year. One exception was isolate
13F-69, the most genetically distant strain, located in a different cluster.
Categorical functions in the annotated accessory genes of both collections were
preserved among all isolates. No significant differences in frequency of
insertion sequences in historical (0.18-0.20)-excluding the outlier strain-versus
contemporary isolates (0.11-0.19) were found despite the expected resting effect.
The most dissimilar isolate, 13F-69, contains a highly preserved plasmid
previously described in Bordetella bronchiseptica. This strain exhibited a few
antibiotic resistance genes not resulting in a resistant phenotype, suggesting
the value of gene down expression in adaptation to long-term starvation.
