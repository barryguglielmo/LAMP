Chitinase and chitin-oligosaccaride can be used in multiple field, so it is
important to develop a high-yield chitinase producing strain. Here, a recombinant
Pichia pastoris with 4 copies of ChiA gene from Bacillus licheniformis and
co-expression of molecular chaperon HAC1 was constructed. The amount of
recombinant ChiA in the supernatant of high-cell-density fermentation reaches a
maximum of 12.7 mg/mL, which is 24-fold higher than that reported in the previous
study. The recombinant ChiA can hydrolyze 30% collodidal chitin with 74%
conversion ratio, and GlcNAc is the most abundant hydrolysis product, followed by
N, N'-diacetylchitobiose. Combined with BsNagZ, the hydrolysate of ChiA can be
further transformed into GlcNAc with 88% conversion ratio. Additionally, the
hydrolysate of ChiA can obviously accelerate the germination growth of rice and
wheat, increasing the seedling height and root length by at least 1.6 folds
within 10 days.
