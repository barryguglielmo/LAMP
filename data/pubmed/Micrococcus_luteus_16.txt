In the present study, we report the design and synthesis of new derivatives of
the β-keto-enol grafted on pyridine and furan moieties (L 1 -L 11 ). Structures
of compounds were fully confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FT-IR), 1H NMR, 13C NMR, electrospray ionization/liquid chromatography-mass
spectrometry (ESI/LC-MS), and elemental analysis. The compounds were screened for
antifungal and antibacterial activities (Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and
Micrococcus luteus). In vitro evaluation showed significant fungicidal activity
for L 1 , L 4 , and L 5 against fungal strains (Fusarium oxysporum f.sp
albedinis) compared to the reference standard. Especially, the exceptional
activity has been demonstrated for L 1 with IC50 = 12.83 μg/mL. This compound and
the reference benomyl molecule also showed a correlation between experimental
antifungal activity and theoretical predictions by Petra/Osiris/Molinspiration
(POM) calculations and molecular coupling against the Fgb1 protein. The highest
inhibition of bacterial growth for L 1 is due to its strongest binding to the
target protein. This report may stimulate the further synthesis of examples of
this substance class for the development of new drugs.
