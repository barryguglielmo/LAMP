Purpose: Fluoroquinolone-resistant Shigella is considered a serious public health
problem and has been put on the WHO global priority list of antibiotic-resistant 
bacteria. This study was aimed to investigate the fluoroquinolone resistance in
Shigella and its relevant genetic mechanisms.
Materials and Methods: Shigella isolates that were isolated from diarrheal
patient's feces in Ningbo China from 2011 to 2018 were tested for susceptibility 
to ampicillin, gentamicin, tetracycline, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, and
cefotaxime. Genes related to quinolone resistance were amplified by PCR.
Results: A total of 118 Shigella isolates were collected, including 76 S.
flexneri isolates, 40 S. sonnei isolates, and 2 S. boydii isolates. Ciprofloxacin
susceptibility test identified 10 (9%) susceptible, 65 (55%) intermediate, and 43
(36%) resistant isolates. Of 76 S. flexneri isolates, 37 were ciprofloxacin
resistant, a prevalence significantly higher than 6 of 40 S. sonnei isolates
(P=0.01). The isolates collected during 2014-2018 displayed a significant
increase in the prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistance (P=0.05) than those
collected during 2011-2013. All the ciprofloxacin-intermediate and resistant
isolates had mutations of gyrA(S83L) and parC (S80I), whereas only the
ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates had gyrA (D87N) mutation and qnrB gene.
Additionally, 30% of the ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates were positive for
aac(6´)-Ib-cr gene.
Conclusion: This study shows the currently increasing prevalence of ciprofloxacin
resistance. The reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility is highly associated with 
gyrA (S83L) and parC (S80I) mutations, while the fluoroquinolone resistance is
highly associated with gyrA (D87N) mutation, qnrB gene and perhaps aac(6´)-Ib-cr 
gene.
