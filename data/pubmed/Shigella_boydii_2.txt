Recently, green synthesis of silver/silver chloride nanoparticles (Ag/AgCl-NPs)
has gained a lot of interest because of the usage of natural resources,
rapidness, eco-friendliness, and benignancy. Several researchers reported that
silver-based biogenic NPs have both antimicrobial and anticancer properties. In
the present study, Ag/AgCl-NPs were synthesized from Zizyphus mauritiana fruit
extract, and their antibacterial, antifungal, and antiproliferative mechanisms
against human MCF-7 cell lines were evaluated. Synthesis of Ag/AgCl-NPs from the 
Z. mauritiana fruit extract was confirmed by the changes of color and a peak of
the UV-visible spectrum at 428 nm. The nanoparticles were characterized by
transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray, X-ray powder
diffraction, thermal gravimetric analysis, atomic force microscope, and Fourier
transform infrared. Antibacterial activity was checked against four pathogenic
bacteria and two fungi. Cytotoxicity was checked against human breast cancer cell
line (MCF-7) and mice Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) cells by MTS assay and
clonogenicity assay. Cell morphology of the control and nanoparticle-treated
MCF-7 cells were checked by Hoechst 33342, YF488-Annexin V, and caspase-3
substrates. The level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was studied by using
2',7'-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate staining. Real-time polymerase chain reaction
was used for gene expression. Synthesized nanoparticles were heat stable cubic
crystals with an average size of 16 nm that contain silver and chlorine with
various functional groups. The synthesized Ag/AgCl-NPs inhibited the growth of
three pathogenic bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Shigella boydii, and Escherichia
coli) and two fungi (Aspergillus niger and Trichoderma spp.). Ag/AgCl-NPs
inhibited the growth of MCF-7 and EAC cells with the IC50 values of 28 and 84
μg/mL, respectively. No colony was formed in MCF-7 cells in the presence of these
nanoparticles as compared with control. Ag/AgCl-NPs induced apoptosis and
generated ROS in MCF-7 cells. The expression level of FAS, FADD, and caspase-8
genes increased several folds with the decrease of PARP gene expression. These
results demonstrated that the anti-proliferation activity of Ag/AgCl-NPs against 
MCF-7 cells resulted through ROS generation and induction of apoptosis through
the Fas-mediated pathway.
