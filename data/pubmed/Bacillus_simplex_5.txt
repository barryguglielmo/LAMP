Rehabilitation of heavy metals contaminated soils using association between
legumes and beneficial rhizospheric microorganisms such as plant growth-promoting
bacteria (PGPR) is a major challenge in agronomy. The present study focuses on
assessing the impact of field inoculation with I1 (Rhizobium leguminosarum
(M5) + Bacillus simplex + Luteibacter sp. + Variovorax sp.) and I5 (R.
leguminosarum (M5) + Pseudomonas fluorescens (K23) + Luteibacter sp. + Variovorax
sp.) on growth and phytoremediation potential of Lathyrus sativus plants as well 
as soil quality and fertility. The experimentation was carried out in mine
tailings of northern Tunisia. Obtained Results indicated that the in situ
inoculation with I1 and I5 significantly increased the shoots (47% and 22%) and
roots dry weights (22% and 29%), as well as nodules number (48% and 31%),
respectively, compared to uninoculated plants. The maximum Pb accumulation in the
above-ground tissue was recorded in plants inoculated with I5 (1180.85 mg kg-1
DW). At the same time, we noticed a reduction in total Pb and Cd in the
rhizosphere of inoculated plots mainly in those inoculated with I5 reaching 46%
and 61%, respectively, compared to uninoculated plots. Likewise, I5 inoculum
significantly enhanced soil total nitrogen (35%) and available phosphorus (100%),
as well as β-glucosidase (16%), urease (32%) and alkaline phosphatase (12%)
activities. Here we demonstrate the usefulness of L. sativus inoculated with I5
inoculum formed by mixing efficient and heavy metals resistant PGPR to boost an
efficient reclamation of Cd and Pb contaminated soils and, ultimately, to improve
their quality and fertility.
