AIMS: The main objective of the present work was to evaluate plant
growth-promoting abilities of bacterial strains from the rhizosphere of
halophytes and their effect on maize growth under salinity stress.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Halophilic bacteria were identified using 16S rRNA sequence 
analysis and their plant growth-promoting abilities were characterized.
Phylogenetic analysis showed that bacterial strains belonging to Bacillus,
Halobacillus and Pseudomonas were dominant in the rhizosphere of halophytes. More
than 93% strains showed P-solubilization activity and IAA production. About 54%
strains were able to produce ACC deaminase, 29% strains showed positive results
for nitrogen fixation, 41 and 21% strains showed siderophores and HCN production 
ability respectively. More than 90% strains showed antifungal activity against
more than two fungal pathogens and production of different hydrolytic enzymes. To
study the plant growth-promoting effect on maize, five bacterial strains Bacillus
safensis HL1HP11 and Bacillus pumilus HL3RS14, Kocuria rosea HL1RP8, Enterobacter
aerogenes AT1HP4 and Aeromonas veronii AT1RP10 were used as inoculants; in the
form of seed coat and enriched soil-based phosphate biofertilizers. All bacterial
strains positively affected the maize growth as compared to non-inoculated
control + NaCl plants. Plants inoculated with Bacillus HL3RS14-based soil
biofertilizers showed maximum increase in dry weights of root (48-124%) and shoot
(52-131%) as compared to control + NaCl (soil + rock phosphate, no inoculum).
PGPR inoculations under salinity stress conditions showed high concentrations of 
proline, glycine betaine and malondialdehyde.
CONCLUSION: These results indicated that under saline soil conditions, halophilic
PGPR strains combined with carrier materials are promising candidates as
biofertilizers.
