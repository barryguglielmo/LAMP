The aim of this work was to report the detection of a putative novel Ehrlichia
strain associated with the tick Amblyomma triste. Free-living adult ticks
determined as A. triste were collected by drag-sampling in Argentina and Uruguay.
Molecular detection of Ehrlichia agents was performed targeting three different
loci: 16S rRNA gene, dsb gene and a fragment of groESL heat shock operon. In
total, 164 adults of A. triste (38 from INTA E.E.A Delta del Paraná in Argentina 
and 126 from Toledo Chico in Uruguay) were analyzed. One tick (0.6%) collected in
INTA E.E.A. Delta del Paraná (Argentina) was positive. The phylogenetic analyses 
show that the Ehrlichia strain found in this study (named Ehrlichia sp. strain
Delta) represents an independent lineage within the genus Ehrlichia, close to E. 
chaffeensis and E. muris. This is also the first report of an Ehrlichia agent
infecting the tick A. triste. The medical and veterinary significance of
Ehrlichia sp. strain Delta remains to be demonstrated. However, it is important
to mention that adults of A. triste are aggressive to humans and domestic
mammals. Therefore, the potential role of A. triste in the transmission of
Ehrlichia agents to humans or domestic animals across its distributional range
should be highlighted, even more considering that Ehrlichia sp. strain Delta is
phylogenetically related to the zoonotic E. chaffeensis, which is recognized as
pathogenic to both humans and animals.
