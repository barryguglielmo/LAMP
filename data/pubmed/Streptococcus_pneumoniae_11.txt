BACKGROUND: Introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) has shown a
marked reduction in the disease caused by vaccine serotypes in children providing
herd protection to the elderly group. However, the emergence of non-vaccine
serotypes is of great concern worldwide.
METHODS: This study includes national laboratory data from invasive pneumococcal 
disease (IPD) cases affecting pediatric and adult population during 2009-2019.
The impact of implementing different vaccine strategies for immunocompetent
adults comparing Spanish regions using PCV13 vs regions using PPV23 vaccine was
also analyzed for 2017-2019.
RESULTS: The overall reductions of IPD cases by PCV13 serotypes in children and
adults were 88% and 59% respectively during 2009-2019 with a constant increase of
serotype 8 in adults since 2015. IPD cases by additional serotypes covered by
PPV23 increased from 20% in 2009 to 52% in 2019. In children, serotype 24F was
the most frequent in 2019 whereas in adults, serotypes 3 and 8 accounted for 36% 
of IPD cases. Introduction of PCV13 or PPV23 in the adult calendar of certain
Spanish regions reduced up to 25% and 11% respectively the IPD cases by PCV13
serotypes, showing a decrease of serotype 3 when PCV13 was used.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of PCV13 in children has shown a clear impact in pneumococcal
epidemiology reducing the burden of IPD in children but also in adults by herd
protection although the increase of serotype 8 in adults is worrisome.
Vaccination with PCV13 in immunocompetent adults seems to control IPD cases by
PCV13 serotypes including serotype 3.
