Intensive horizontal gene transfer may generate diversity and heterogeneity
within the genus Gardnerella. Restriction-modification (R-M) systems and
CRISPR-Cas are the principal defense tools against foreign DNA in bacteria.
Nearly half of the tested Gardnerella spp. isolates harbored the CRISPR-Cas
system. Several putative R-M systems of Gardnerella spp. strains were identified 
in the REBASE database. However, there was no experimental evidence for
restriction endonuclease (REase) activity in the isolates. We showed that G.
vaginalis strain ATCC 14018 contains the REase R.Gva14018I, which recognizes GGCC
and most probably generates blunt ends on cleavage. Bioinformatics evidence and
the activity of recombinant methyltransferase M.Gva14018I in vivo indicate that
ATCC 14018 possesses a HaeIII-like R-M system. The truncated R.Gva14018I-4
lacking the C-terminal region was expressed in Escherichia coli and displayed
wild-type REase specificity. Polyclonal antibodies against R.Gva14018I-4 detected
the wild-type REase in the cell lysate of ATCC 14018. The cofactor requirements
for activity and bioinformatics analysis indicated that R.Gva14018I belongs to
the PD-(D/E)XK family of REases. The REase-like activity was observed in 5 of 31 
tested Gardnerella spp. strains, although none of these matched the DNA digestion
pattern of R.Gva14018I.
