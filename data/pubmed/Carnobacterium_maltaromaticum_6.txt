Carnobacterium maltaromaticum, Brochothrix thermosphacta and Serratia
liquefaciens are common spoilage organisms found within the microbiome of
refrigerated vacuum-packaged (VP) beef. Extending and predicting VP beef
shelf-life requires knowledge about how spoilage bacteria growth is influenced by
environmental extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Multifactorial effects of pH,
lactic acid (LA) and glucose on growth kinetics were quantified for C.
maltaromaticum, B. thermosphacta and S. liquefaciens within a heat shrink-wrapped
VP commercial film containing a simulated beef medium. LA, pH, and undissociated 
lactic acid (UDLA) significantly affected bacterial growth rate (p < 0.001),
whereas 5.55 mM glucose produced a marginal effect. At 1.12 mM UDLA, growth rate 
and maximum population density decreased 20.9 and 3.5%, 56 and 7%, and 11 and 2% 
for C. maltaromaticum, B. thermosphacta, and S. liquefaciens, respectively.
