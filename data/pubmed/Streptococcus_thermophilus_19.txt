The ability to genetically engineer pathogenic mycobacteria has increased
significantly over the last decades due to the generation of new molecular tools.
Recently, the application of the Streptococcus pyogenes and the Streptococcus
thermophilus CRISPR-Cas9 systems in mycobacteria has enabled gene editing and
efficient CRISPR interference-mediated transcriptional regulation. Here, we
converted CRISPR interference into an efficient genome editing tool for
mycobacteria. We demonstrate that the Streptococcus thermophilus CRISPR1-Cas9
(Sth1Cas9) is functional in Mycobacterium marinum and Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
enabling highly efficient and precise DNA breaks and indel formation, without any
off-target effects. In addition, with dual sgRNAs this system can be used to
generate two indels simultaneously or to create specific deletions. The ability
to use the power of the CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing toolbox in M.
tuberculosis with a single step will accelerate research into this deadly
pathogen.
