Electronic waste is an evolving source of harmful pollutants in our surrounding
environments and considered to be perilous as it contains toxic metals such as
chromium, cadmium, lead, mercury, zinc, and nickel in huge quantities. Heavy
metals are harmful contaminants and accumulated in the environment due to various
anthropogenic activities. The present study was conducted to isolate and
characterize different heavy metal tolerant bacterial species, based on molecular
techniques from soil contaminated by electronic waste. The contaminated soil
samples were analyzed for various physicochemical properties such as pH,
electrical conductivity, soil moisture, water holding capacity, organic carbon,
organic matter, available phosphorus, total nitrogen, and potassium using
standard procedures. The soil samples were found to contain a higher amount of
different heavy metals such as copper, chromium, lead, iron, cadmium, and nickel.
Serial dilution and spread plate techniques have been used for bacterial
isolation. The identification and molecular characterization of isolated
bacterial species were done by biochemical tests and 16S rRNA gene sequencing
technique. The 16S rRNA sequencing analysis confirmed the presence of different
bacterial species as, Micrococcus aloeverae, Kocuria turfanensis, Bacillus
licheniformis, Bacillus jeotgali, Bacillus velezensis, and Bacillus haikouensis. 
The findings indicated that the e-waste dumping sites are the storehouse of elite
bacterial species. The present research study offers a platform for systematic
analysis of e-waste sites by microbial profiling that may help in the innovation 
of novel microorganisms of scientific importance and better biotechnological
potential.
