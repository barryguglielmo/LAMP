Background: This study was conducted aimed at evaluating the antibacterial
property of the recombinant peptide of bacteriocin entrocin P (EnP), the
essential oil of Cuminum cyminum, and the extract of Ferulago angulata on some
oral pathogens. Besides, the cytotoxicity of EnP was evaluated.
Material and Methods: The antimicrobial property was tested on streptococcus
mutans (ATCC 35668), streptococcus salivarius (ATCC 9222), streptococcus oralis
(ATCC 35037), and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), using the microbroth
dilution method. The 0.2% Chlorhexidin (CHX) mouthwash was used as the control
group. Besides, the cytotoxicity analysis was done on gingival fibroblasts by the
MTT colorimetric method. The data were reported using descriptive methods, and
analyzed by one-way ANOVA, and Tukey's HSD test.
Results: The strongest bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects of C. cyminum and 
F. angulata were observed for S.mutans and S. oralis, respectively (with the MIC 
and MBC value being 62.5 μg/mL). The antibacterial properties of EnP were
comparable to those of CHX, being several times stronger than medicinal plants
(1-14 μg/mL). Based on the cytotoxicity evaluation, there was no statistically
significant difference observed between the cytotoxicity of the control group and
that of Enp for three evaluations, except after 72 hours when the cell viability 
at the concentration of 3.75 µg/ml was significantly lower than that of the
control group (P=0.05). However, no concentration of EnP was observed to be over 
50% of the growth inhibition (IC50) of the fibroblasts for the three evaluations.
Conclusions: EnP could be utilized in dental materials as a natural and safe
antimicrobial agent against oral streptococci and E. faecalis, being as effective
as CHX mouthwash. Key words:Antimicrobial peptide, Bacteriocin Entrocin P,
Chlorhexidine, Cuminum cyminum, Enterococcus faecalis, Ferulago angulata.
