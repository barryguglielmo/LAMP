Acetobacter pasteurianus, a member of Alphaproteobacteria, is an acetic
acid-producing bacterium present on sugar-rich substrates such as such as fruits,
flowers and vegetables and traditionally used in the production of fermented
food. The preferred living habitat associated to acid conditions makes the
structure of the bacterial cell wall interesting to study, due to expectable
uncommon features. We here used a combination of chemical, analytical and NMR
spectroscopy approaches to define the complete structure of the core
oligosaccharide from Acetobacter pasteurianus CIP103108 LPS. Interestingly, the
core oligosaccharide displays a high concentration of negatively charged groups, 
structural features that might contribute to reinforce the bacterial membrane.
