The draft genome sequence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa LMG 1272, isolated from
mushroom, is reported here. This strain triggers formation of a precipitate
("white line") when cocultured with Pseudomonas tolaasii However, LMG 1272 lacks 
the capacity to produce a cyclic lipopeptide that is typically associated with
white line formation, suggesting the involvement of a different diffusible
factor.
