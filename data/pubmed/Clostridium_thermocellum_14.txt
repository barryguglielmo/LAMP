Assessment of combination of pretreatment of Sorghum durra stalk and production
of chimeric enzyme (β-glucosidase and endo β-1,4 glucanase, CtGH1-L1-CtGH5-F194A)
and cellobiohydrolase (CtCBH5A) for saccharification to produce bioethanol.

Optimization of pretreatment and saccharification of Sorghum durra stalk (Sds)
was carried out. The chimeric enzyme (CtGH1-L1-CtGH5-F194A) having β-glucosidase 
(CtGH1) and endo β-1,4 glucanase activity (CtGH5-F194A) and cellobiohydrolase
(CtCBH5A) from Clostridium thermocellum were used for saccharification. Chimeric 
enzyme will save production cost of two enzymes, individually. Stage 2
pretreatment by 1% (w/v) NaOH assisted autoclaving + 1.5% (v/v) dilute H2SO4
assisted oven heating gave lower total sugar yield (366.6 mg/g of pretreated Sds)
and total glucose yield (195 mg/g of pretreated Sds) in pretreated hydrolysate
with highest crystallinity index 55.6% than the other stage 2 pretreatments.
Optimized parameters for saccharification of above stage 2 pretreated biomass
were 3% (w/v) biomass concentration, enzyme (chimera: cellobiohydrolase) ratio,
2:3 (U/g) of biomass, total enzyme loading (350 U/g of pretreated biomass), 24 h 
and 30 °C. Best stage 2 pretreated Sds under optimized enzyme saccharification
conditions gave maximum total reducing sugar yield 417 mg/g and glucose yield
285 mg/g pretreated biomass in hydrolysate. Best stage 2 pretreated Sds showed
significantly higher cellulose, 71.3% and lower lignin, 2.0% and hemicellulose,
12.2% (w/w) content suggesting the effectiveness of method. This hydrolysate upon
SHF using Saccharomyces cerevisiae under unoptimized conditions produced ethanol 
yield, 0.12 g/g of glucose. Abbreviation: Ct-Clostridium thermocellum,
