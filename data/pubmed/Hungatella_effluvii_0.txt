Hungatella spp. are anaerobic bacteria, are known members of the gut microbiome
and very rarely cause human infection. Hungatella effluvii was isolated from an
effluent treatment plant in 2014. We report a case of bacteremia due to
H. effluvii that occurred after hematochezia in a patient with prostate cancer.
It was misidentified by the VITEK 2 system (bioMérieux, France) and
matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry
(MALDI-TOF MS) and was correctly identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
