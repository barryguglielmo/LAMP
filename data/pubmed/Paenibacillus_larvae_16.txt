The Paenibacillus larvae infecting phage API480 (vB_PlaP_API480) is the first
reported podovirus for this bacterial species, with an 58 nm icosahedral capsid
and a 12 × 8 nm short, non-contractile tail. API480 encodes 77 coding sequences
(CDSs) on its 45,026 bp dsDNA genome, of which 47 were confirmed using mass
spectrometry. This phage has got very limited genomic and proteomic similarity to
any other known ones registered in public databases, including P. larvae phages. 
Comparative genomics indicates API480 is a new species as it's a singleton with
28 unique proteins. Interestingly, the lysis module is highly conserved among P. 
larvae phages, containing a predicted endolysin and two putative holins. The well
kept overall genomic organisation (from the structural and morphogenetic modules 
to the host lysis, DNA replication and metabolism related proteins) confirms a
common evolutionary ancestor among P. larvae infecting phages. API480 is able to 
infect 69% of the 61 field strains with an ERIC I genotype, as well as ERIC II
strains. Furthermore, this phage is very stable when exposed to high glucose
concentrations and to larval gastrointestinal conditions. This highly-specific
phage, with its broad lytic activity and stability in hive conditions, might
potentially be used in the biocontrol of American Foulbrood (AFB).
