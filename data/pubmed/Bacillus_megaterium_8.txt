In spore forming microbes, germination protease (GPR) plays a key role in the
initiation of the germination process. A critical step during germination is the 
degradation of small acid-soluble proteins (SASPs), which protect spore DNA from 
external stresses (UV, heat, low temperature, etc.). Inactive zymogen GPR can be 
activated by autoprocessing of the N-terminal pro-sequence domain. Activated GPR 
initiates the degradation of SASPs; however, the detailed mechanisms underlying
the activation, catalysis, regulation, and substrate recognition of GPR remain
elusive. In this study, we determined the crystal structure of GPR from
Paenisporosarcina sp. TG-20 (PaGPR) in its inactive form at a resolution of 2.5
A. Structural analysis showed that the active site of PaGPR is sterically
occluded by an inhibitory loop region (residues 202-216). The N-terminal region
interacts directly with the self-inhibitory loop region, suggesting that the
removal of the N-terminal pro-sequence induces conformational changes, which lead
to the release of the self-inhibitory loop region from the active site. In
addition, comparative sequence and structural analyses revealed that PaGPR
contains two highly conserved Asp residues (D123 and D182) in the active site,
similar to the putative aspartic acid protease GPR from Bacillus megaterium. The 
catalytic domain structure of PaGPR also shares similarities with the
sequentially non-homologous proteins HycI and HybD. HycI and HybD are
metal-loproteases that also contain two Asp (or Glu) residues in their active
site, playing a role in metal binding. In summary, our results provide useful
insights into the activation process of PaGPR and its active conformation.
