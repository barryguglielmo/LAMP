Propionibacterium freudenreichii is a beneficial bacterium with documented
effects on the gut microbiota and on inflammation. Its presence within the animal
and human intestinal microbiota was correlated with immunomodulatory effects,
mediated by both propionibacterial surface components and by secreted
metabolites. It is widely implemented, both in the manufacture of fermented dairy
products such as Swiss-type cheeses, and in the production of probiotic food
complements, under the form of freeze-dried powders. The bottleneck of this
drying process consists in the limited survival of bacteria during drying and
storage. Protective pre-treatments have been applied to other bacteria and may,
in a strain-dependent manner, confer enhanced resistance. However, very little
information was yet published on P. freudenreichii adaptation to freeze-drying.
In this report, an immunomodulatory strain of this probiotic bacterium was
cultured under hyperosmotic constraint in order to trigger osmoadaptation. This
adaptation was then combined with acid or thermal pre-treatment. Such combination
led to accumulation of key stress proteins, of intracellular compatible solute
glycine betaine, to modulation of the propionibacterial membrane composition, and
to enhanced survival upon freeze-drying. This work opens new perspectives for
efficient production of live and active probiotic propionibacteria.
