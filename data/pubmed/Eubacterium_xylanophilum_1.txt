Our pre-experiments found that the brain circRNA sequence profiles and gut
microbiota in AD-like mice were changed, as circNF1-419 could enhance autophagy
to ameliorate senile dementia in AD-like mice, so we conclude that there might
some connections between circRNA and gut microbiome. Therefore, we use the
over-expressed circNF1-419 adeno-associated virus (AAV) animal system with the
aim of identifying possible connections. Our results showed that over-expression 
of circNF1-419 in brain not only influenced the cholinergic system of brain, but 
also changed the gut microbiota composition as the Candidatus Arthromitus,
Lachnospiraceae FCS020 group, Lachnospiraceae UCG-006, and [Eubacterium]
xylanophilum group, and the intestinal homeostasis and physiology, and even the
gut microbiota trajectory in new born mice. These findings demonstrate a link
between circRNA and gut microbiome, enlarge the 'microbiome- transcriptome'
linkage library and provide more information on gut-brain axis.
