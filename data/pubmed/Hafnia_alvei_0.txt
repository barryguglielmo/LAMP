This study was undertaken to improve the detection accuracy for coliform
bacteria, by analyzing biochemical properties of false positive and false
negative colonies isolated from two dry rehydratable film methods, 3 M™
Petrifilm™ E. coli/Coliform count (PCC) and MC-Media Pad coliform count (MCC).
The detection accuracy of PCC and MCC was determined to be 99.4% and 97.9%,
respectively, with the detection error being 0.6% and 2.1%, respectively. False
positive colonies (red colony without gas) on PCC were identified as Hafnia alvei
and Enterobacter cloacae. All false positive colonies on MCC were identified as
Aeromonas caviae; this organism gives a positive oxidase test, whereas coliform
bacteria are oxidase negative. In conclusion, we propose that for improving
detection accuracy of coliform bacteria, the incubation time of PCC should be
modified and increased from 24 h to 48 h, and the oxidase test of MCC isolates
should be included in the Korea Food Code.
