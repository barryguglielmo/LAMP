BACKGROUND: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are a group of opportunistic 
pathogens, which are widely spread in the environment. Animal breeding is an
important source of pathogen spreading. However, the concentration and
characteristics of CoNS in the bioaerosols of henhouses are unclear.
RESULTS: In this study, we showed that CoNS were significantly increased in
bioaerosols of henhouses during the first 60 days, and reached 2.0 × 106 CFU/m3, 
which account for 75.4% of total bacteria. One hundred and two CoNS isolates from
bioaerosols and nasal swabs of farmers were further identified, covering seven
species. Among these, 41.2% isolates were Staphylococcus sciuri, which was the
predominant species, followed by S. equorum, S. saprophyticus, S. haemolyticus,
S. xylosus, S. arlettae and S. gallinarum. There were high rates of resistance to
oxacillin in CoNS (49.0%), which were defined as Methicillin-Resistant CoNS
(MRCoNS), and 36.3% isolates contained resistance gene mecA. Bioaerosol infection
models showed that, chickens exposed to aerosolized S. sciuri had significant
induction of inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 at 
5 days post-infection (dpi) in lungs and at 7 dpi in spleens.
CONCLUSIONS: We reported a high concentration of CoNS in henhouses, and S. sciuri
was the preponderant CoNS species. Antibiotic resistance analysis and bioaerosols
infection of CoNS further highlighted its hazards on resistance and immunological
challenge. These results suggested that, CoNS in bioaerosols could be one serious
factor in the henhouses for not only poultry industry but also public health.
