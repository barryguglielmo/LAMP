Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis remains the most prevalent serotype
causing human salmonellosis through the consumption of contaminated foods,
especially poultry products. The development of a subunit vaccine against S.
Enteritidis can not only protect chickens against Salmonella infection in the
poultry industry but also cut the transmission sources. In this study, both the
expressed recombinant outer membrane protein F (rOmpF) and extracted outer
membrane vesicles (OMVs) were developed as subunit vaccines against S.
Enteritidis challenge in chickens. Immunization with the subunit vaccine could
induce not only antibody production but also strong cell-mediated immune
response. Both rOmpF plus QuilA adjuvant and OMVs alone had highly protective
efficacy against S. Enteritidis challenge and rapidly decreased the colonization 
of bacteria in chicken. These findings revealed the potential application of
rOmpF and OMVs as subunit vaccines in the poultry industry.
