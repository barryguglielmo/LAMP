BACKGROUND: The human colon is colonised by a dense microbial community whose
species composition and metabolism are linked to health and disease. The main
energy sources for colonic bacteria are dietary polysaccharides and
oligosaccharides. These play a major role in modulating gut microbial composition
and metabolism, which in turn can impact on health outcomes.
RESULTS: We investigated the influence of wheat bran arabinoxylan
oligosaccharides (AXOS) and maltodextrin supplements in modulating the
composition of the colonic microbiota and metabolites in healthy adults over the 
age of 60. Male and female volunteers, (n = 21, mean BMI 25.2 ± 0.7 kg/m2)
participated in the double-blind, cross over supplement study. Faecal samples
were collected for analysis of microbiota, short chain fatty acids levels and
calprotectin. Blood samples were collected to measure glucose, cholesterol and
triglycerides levels. There was no change in these markers nor in calprotectin
levels in response to the supplements. Both supplements were well-tolerated by
the volunteers. Microbiota analysis across the whole volunteer cohort revealed a 
significant increase in the proportional abundance of faecal Bifidobacterium
species (P ≤ 0.01) in response to AXOS, but not maltodextrin, supplementation.
There was considerable inter-individual variation in the other bacterial taxa
that responded, with a clear stratification of volunteers as either
Prevotella-plus (n = 8; > 0.1% proportional abundance) or Prevotella-minus
(n = 13; ≤0.1% proportional abundance) subjects founded on baseline sample
profiles. There was a significant increase in the proportional abundance of both 
faecal Bifidobacterium (P ≤ 0.01) and Prevotella species (P ≤ 0.01) in
Prevotella-plus volunteers during AXOS supplementation, while Prevotella and
Bacteroides relative abundances showed an inverse relationship. Proportional
abundance of 26 OTUs, including bifidobacteria and Anaerostipes hadrus, differed 
significantly between baseline samples of Prevotella-plus compared to
Prevotella-minus individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: The wheat bran AXOS supplementation was bifidogenic and resulted in 
changes in human gut microbiota composition that depended on the initial
microbiota profile, specifically the presence or absence of Prevotella spp. as a 
major component of the microbiota. Our data therefore suggest that initial
profiling of individuals through gut microbiota analysis should be considered
important when contemplating nutritional interventions that rely on prebiotics.
