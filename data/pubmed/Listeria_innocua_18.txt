Chitosan films loaded with bacteriocin were examined by FTIR spectroscopy, tested
for color, puncture strength, water vapor permeability, and as antimicrobials of 
Listeria innocua HPB13. Divergicin M35, a bacteriocin produced by Carnobacterium 
divergens, was incorporated into films made with chitosan of molecular mass
2 kDa, 20 kDa, or 100 kDa and de-acetylated either 87% or 95%. Only 100 kDa
chitosan yielded films that could be peeled and handled easily. The higher degree
of de-acetylation increased the total color factor (ΔE) of bacteriocin-loaded
films, their permeability, and puncture strength. Incorporation of divergicin M35
into the films increased amide I peak intensity but otherwise did not induce
significant structural change. The FTIR spectra of divergicin M35 shed from the
films did not differ from those of the original free bacteriocin, except in
overall peak intensity. The release of active divergicin M35 from the film was
faster into the buffer than into tryptic soy broth and peaked at 10-12 h in both 
cases. Chitosan 95% de-acetylated and loaded with divergicin M35 was the most
active, producing a six-log drop in Listeria innocua HPB13 viable count within
24 h. These results suggest that the biocompatible and biodegradable films
developed here have the potential for application as antimicrobials of Listeria
spp. in foods, especially ready-to-eat, minimally processed products.
