Chryseobacterium indologenes are aerobic, Gram negative, nonfermentative rods
that are intrinsically multi-drug resistant. Reported infections include
bacteremia, pneumonia, meningitis, myositis, keratitis, and indwelling devices.
We present the clinical course of a 52-year-old African male with a medical
history of end stage renal disease (ESRD) in hemodialysis with multiple episodes 
of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) presenting with
symptoms of chills, malaise, and localized erythema on insertion site of
permacath. Blood cultures obtained from catheter showed C. indologenes.
Successful response was obtained with piperacillin/tazobactam based on
sensitivity and removal of indwelling catheter. Given the increase in the number 
of cases reported in the literature, guidelines for the management of this
pathogen should be considered.
