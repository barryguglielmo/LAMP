Tetanus is a serious and potentially fatal systemic disease, caused by the
bacterium Clostridium tetani. It is estimated that 1 million cases occur
worldwide annually. Immunization programs have drastically decreased tetanus in
developed countries, and the sporadic cases have been linked to injecting drug
users (IDUs), immunosuppressed individuals, or those older than 65 without
complete vaccination. Regrettably, it is still endemic in under-developed
countries. In Spain, an average of 10 cases are notified each year, especially
affecting those older than 65. The present article describes a case of a
48-year-old Spanish woman, an ex-convict and IDU with infection antecedents of
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C (HCV), who was admitted to the
Emergency Department of a University Hospital with cervical rigidity and trismus.
In a few hours, a neurological and respiratory deterioration was observed,
resulting in admittance to the intensive care unit under the suspicion of a
generalized tetanus infection. The treatment included hemodynamic support and
respiratory therapy, antibiotics, muscle relaxants, sedatives, and tetanus
immunoglobulin. Her stay in the ICU lasted 47 days. The clinical suspicion, the
antecedents of risk, and the verification of the vaccination records should
provide early guidance for diagnostics and the establishment of a treatment in
these cases.
