As being a rapidly developing area, the production of nondairy-based functional
beverages continues to accelerate considerably. In the present study, the
probiotification of a mixture of the juices of Jerusalem artichoke, pineapple,
pumpkin, spinach, and cucumber has been utilized for the development of probiotic
fruit-vegetable juice. Lactic acid fermentation was comparatively performed by
Lactobacillus acidophilus DSM13241, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei
ATCC 55544, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus ATCC53103, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum
DSMZ 20174, and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 at 37 °C for 24 h.
Following, the fermented products were kept at 8 °C for 45 days, and viability of
the strains were tested during the storage period, which refers 15th, 30th, and
45th days. During fermentation, the number of viable probiotic cells increased up
to 9.42 log CFU/mL. Consequently, at the end of storage, all strains exhibited an
acceptable amount of viability along with L. rhamnosus ATCC 53103 with the
highest value reaching 9.30 log CFU/mL. The beverage was successfully scaled up
in a bioreactor followed by a sensory evaluation. Statistical analysis revealed
that there is a significant difference (p < 0.05) on how much the product was
enjoyed between all tested samples with an average score of 3.8 out of 7.0. Thus,
flavor and consumer acceptability of the beverage was improved with the addition 
of 30% of apple juice. The results affirm that the proposed novel fermented
mixture of Jerusalem artichoke, pineapple, pumpkin, spinach, and cucumber stands 
as a promising functional product to be placed in the beverage market.
