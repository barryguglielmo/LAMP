The present investigation gives an insight on the potential of food and kitchen
waste as a suitable feed stock for the production of biopolymer, biofuels,
enzymes and chemicals. Media engineering improved poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB)
production from 0.91 g/L to 5.132 g/L. There is a five-fold increase in PHB
production. The food and kitchen waste was also evaluated for the production of
bioethanol, 2, 3 - butanediol, and pectinase. Saccharomyces cerevisiae produced
0.316 g of bioethanol, Bacillus sonorensis MPTD1 produced 2.47 (µM/mL)/min of
pectinase and Enterobacter cloacae SG1 produced 3 g/L of 2, 3-butanediol with a
productivity of 0.03 g/L/h using food and kitchen waste as carbon source.
Targeting on multiple value added products will improve the overall process
economics.
