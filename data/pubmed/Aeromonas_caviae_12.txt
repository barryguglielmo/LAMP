Two arsenic (As) hyper-tolerant bacterial strains NM01 Paracoccus versutus and
NM04 Aeromonas caviae were isolated from As polluted site of West Bengal, India. 
The strains not only possess the potential to tolerate up to 20,000 mgl-1 As(V)
and 10,000 mgl-1 As(III) but also possess plant growth promoting (PGP) traits
like phosphate solubilization, siderophore production, IAA production. Greenhouse
pot experiments were conducted to assess the effect of rhizospheric inoculation
of both the strains individually and in consortia in As accumulation by Adiantum 
capillus-veneries. It was observed that the microbial inoculation significantly
(p < 0.05) increased the synthesis of thiolic compounds and thus, enhanced As
accumulation with translocation factor (TF) > 1. The strains regulated endogenous
phytohormone up to 90% and 77.9% increase in auxin of consortia inoculated root
and shoot, respectively. Interestingly, inoculation of the isolated strains
augmented rhizospheric microbial diversity which was negatively affected by heavy
metal. The results of high-throughput Illumina MiSeq sequencing technique to
observe the composition of the bacterial community revealed 11,536 unique
bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from As + S (non-inoculated),
whereas 11,884 from Consortia As + S (inoculated) rhizospheric soil samples.
Inoculated soil displayed higher bacterial diversity indices (ACE and Chao 1)
with the dominant bacterial phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. 
Our results highlight the innate PGP abilities of the strains and its potential
to facilitate phytoextraction by enhancing As accumulation in the shoot.
