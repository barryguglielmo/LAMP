Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS) is a highly contagious pathogen which not only can
cause neonatal meningitis, pneumonia, and septicemia but is also considered to be
a major cause of bovine mastitis (BM), leading to large economic losses to the
dairy industry worldwide. Like many other pathogenic bacteria, GBS also has the
capacity to form a biofilm structure in the host to cause persistent infection.
Tea saponin (TS), is one of the main active agents extracted from tea ash powder,
and it has good antioxidant and antibacterial activities. In this study, we
confirmed that TS has a slight antibacterial activity against a Streptococcus
agalactiae strain isolated from dairy cow with mastitis and inhibits its biofilm 
formation. By performing scanning electron microscopy (SEM) experiments, we
observed that with addition of TS, the biofilm formed by this GBS strain
exhibited looser structure and lower density. In addition, the results of
real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments
showed that TS inhibited biofilm formation by down-regulating the transcription
of the biofilm-associated genes including srtA, fbsC, neuA, and cpsE.
