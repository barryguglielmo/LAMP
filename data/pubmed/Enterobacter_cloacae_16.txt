Cefiderocol for Infections Caused by Multidrug-Resistant Gram-Negative Bacteria.

Weaver K, Stallworth K, Blakely KK.

In 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved cefiderocol, a new
treatment option for individuals with complicated urinary tract infections.
Cefiderocol is a cephalosporin antibiotic indicated for use in adults 18 years or
older who have minimal treatment options due to resistance for complicated
urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae,
Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter cloacae complex. The 
recommended dose of cefiderocol is 2 g intravenously every 8 hours infused over 3
hours. The dose is adjusted for individuals with creatinine clearance of less
than 60 ml/min or greater than 120 ml/min. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as
diarrhea and constipation are the most common adverse events reported by
individuals taking cefiderocol.
