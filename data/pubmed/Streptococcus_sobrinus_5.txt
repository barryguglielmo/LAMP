OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine and compare the anti-caries effects of
citrus lemon oil (CLO) and limonene in rats.
METHODS: The minimal inhibitory concentrations of CLO and limonene were measured 
using the disk diffusion method. The rats were infected with Streptococcus
sobrinus and assigned into four groups: (1) Chlorhexidine, (2) CLO, (3) limonene,
and (4) distilled water (H2O). The total cultivable microbiota and Streptococcus 
sobrinus in the mouth of the rats were counted, and the caries lesions were
measured by Keyes' scoring and DIAGNOdent examination.
RESULTS: The minimal inhibitory concentrations of CLO and limonene against
Streptococcus sobrinus were 4.50 and 21.00 mg/mL, respectively. The chlorhexidine
group had the lowest total microbiota counts (p < 0.05), while there were no
significant differences among the CLO, limonene and H2O groups (p > 0.05). The
proliferation of Streptococcus sobrinus was remarkably inhibited by
chlorhexidine, limonene and CLO (p < 0.05). The Keyes' scoring and DIAGNOdent
results indicated that the caries lesions were reduced in the CLO and limonene
groups compared to that of the vehicle control group (p < 0.05). There was no
significant difference between CLO and limonene (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Limonene and CLO have similar anti-caries abilities in a
bacteriostatic manner in vivo.
