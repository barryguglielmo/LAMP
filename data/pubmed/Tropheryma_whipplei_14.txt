Joint complaints, most commonly intermittent arthritis, are the initial
manifestation in about three-fourths of Whipple's disease cases. We herein report
on two cases wherein Whipple's disease manifested itself as chronic bursitis and 
tenosynovitis at several sites. A 42 year-old man had bilateral olecranon
bursitis, a right patellar bursitis and an extensor tenosynovitis on the left
wrist and a 54 year-old man had extensor tenosynovitis at both wrists and a
bilateral tenosynovitis of the extensors at both ankle. Methotrexate in both
patients and etanercept in one of them were not effective. Polymerase chain
reaction testing revealed Tropheryma whipplei on feces, bursitis and articular
fluid samples. Duodenal biopsy proved to be normal. Doxycycline and
hydroxychloroquine were rapidly effective. Chronic bursitis and tenosynovitis
must be added to the list of rheumatologic manifestations that may evoke the
diagnosis of Whipple disease.
