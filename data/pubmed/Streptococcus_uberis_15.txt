A series of substituted sulfonamide bioisosteres of 8-hydroxyquinoline were
evaluated for their antibacterial activity against the common mastitis causative 
pathogens Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, both 
in the presence and absence of supplementary zinc. Compounds 9a-e, 10a-c, 11a-e, 
12 and 13 were demonstrated to have MICs of 0.0625 µg/mL against S. uberis in the
presence of 50 µM ZnSO4. Against S. aureus compounds 9g (MIC 4 µg/mL) and 11d
(MIC 8 µg/mL) showed the greatest activity, whereas all compounds were found to
be inactive against E. coli (MIC > 256 µg/mL); again in the presence of 50 µM
ZnSO4. All compounds were demonstrated to be significantly less active in the
absence of supplementary zinc. Compound 9g was subsequently confirmed to be
bactericidal, with an MBC (≥3log10 cfu/mL reduction) of 0.125 µg/mL against S.
uberis in the presence of 50 µM ZnSO4. To validate the sanitising activity of
compound 9g in the presence of supplementary zinc, a quantitative suspension
disinfection (sanitizer) test was performed. In this preliminary test, sanitizing
activity (>5log10 reduction of CFU/mL in 5 min) was observed against S. uberis
for compound 9g at concentrations as low as 1 mg/mL, validating the potential of 
this compound to function as a topical sanitizer against the major environmental 
mastitis-causing microorganism S. uberis.
