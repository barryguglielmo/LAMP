Background: Whipple's disease is caused by Tropheryma whipplei and causes a
self-limiting gastrointestinal infection. The majority of the population is an
asymptomatic carrier, however, in some patients, it causes an invasive infection 
with for example arthritis, endocarditis, or involvement of the eyes.
Case summary: This case describes a man with long-lasting complaints of
progressive dyspnoea caused by heart failure due to total destruction of the
aortic and mitral valve as a result of T. whipplei endocarditis, diagnosed with
serum polymerase chain reaction. The patient was treated with ceftriaxone and
prolonged co-trimoxazole therapy and surgical replacement of the aortic and
mitral valve. He was discharged to a rehabilitation centre.
Discussion: Tropheryma whipplei is one of the possible microorganisms classified 
as causing blood culture-negative endocarditis, with predominantly afebrile
patients that do not fulfil the Dukes criteria, which makes it difficult to
diagnose. Polymerase chain reaction is the cornerstone of the diagnosis. It
requires long-term antibiotic treatment up to 12 months. It is recommended by the
European Society of Cardiology to discuss treatment in an Endocarditis Team
because Whipple's endocarditis has only rarely been described in the literature
previously. Whipple's endocarditis has high mortality and relapse rates.
