Food-borne disease is a widespread and escalating public health problem globally.
About a quarter of the microorganisms isolated from cockroaches are food-borne
pathogens including Escherichia coli O157:H7, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus
cereus, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhi, 
Rotavirus, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Cryptosporidium parvum. Thus, cockroaches
could be an important reservoir and mechanical vector of food-borne pathogens.
Generally, the role of cockroaches in human infections is poorly understood and
has been an issue of debate for several years. This article aims to elucidate the
possible role of cockroaches in food-borne infections by reviewing the relevant
research publications.
