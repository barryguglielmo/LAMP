Among the biotic constraints of common mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) production,
bacterial blotch is considered the most important mushroom disease in terms of
global prevalence and economic impact. Etiology and management of bacterial
blotch has been a major concern since its original description in 1915. Although 
Pseudomonas tolaasii is thought to be the main causal agent, various Pseudomonas 
species, as well as organisms from other genera have been reported to cause
blotch symptoms on mushroom caps. In this review, we provide an updated overview 
on the etiology, epidemiology, and management strategies of bacterial blotch
disease. First, diversity of the causal agent(s) and utility of high throughput
sequencing-based approaches in the precise characterization and identification of
blotch pathogen(s) is explained. Further, due to the limited options for use of
conventional pesticides in mushroom farms against blotch pathogen(s), we
highlight the role of balanced threshold of relative humidity and temperature in 
mushroom farms to combat the disease in organic and conventional production.
Additionally, we discuss the possibility of the use of biological control agents 
(either antagonistic mushroom-associated bacterial strains or bacteriophages) for
blotch management as one of the sustainable approaches for 21st century
agriculture. Finally, we aim to elucidate the association of mushroom microbiome 
in cap development and productivity on one hand, and blotch incidence/outbreaks
on the other hand.
