Using culturomics methods, three strains were isolated, identified and
characterized following the taxonogenomics concept. Clostridium cagae strain
Marseille-P4344T (=CSURP4344), Clostridium rectalis strain Marseille-P4200T
(=CSURP4200) and Hathewaya massiliensis strain Marseille-P3545T (=CSURP3545) were
isolated from human stool samples. The phylogenetic reconstruction, phenotypic
criteria and genomic analyses were carried out and demonstrated that these three 
bacteria are different from previously known bacterial species with standing in
nomenclature and were classified as new members of the Clostridiaceae family.
