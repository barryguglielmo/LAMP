The characterization of cytochrome P450 CYP125A13 from Streptomyces peucetius was
conducted using cholesterol as the sole substrate. The in vitro enzymatic assay
utilizing putidaredoxin and putidaredoxin reductase from Pseudomonas putida
revealed that CYP125A13 bound cholesterol and hydroxylated it. The calculated KD 
value, catalytic conversion rates, and Km value were 56.92 ± 11.28 μM, 1.95 nmol 
min-1 nmol-1, and 11.3 ± 2.8 μM, respectively. Gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis showed that carbon 27 of the cholesterol side-chain
was hydroxylated, characterizing CYP125A13 as steroid C27-hydroxylase. The
homology modeling and docking results also revealed the binding of cholesterol to
the active site, facilitated by the hydrophobic amino acids and position of the
C27-methyl group near heme. This orientation was favorable for the hydroxylation 
of the C27-methyl group, supporting the in vitro analysis. This was the first
reported case of the hydroxylation of cholesterol at the C-27 position by
Streptomyces P450. This study also established the catalytic function of
CYP125A13 and provides a solid basis for further studies related to the catabolic
potential of Streptomyces species.
