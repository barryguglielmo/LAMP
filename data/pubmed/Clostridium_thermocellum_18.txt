The fiber in corn kernels, currently unutilized in the corn to ethanol process,
represents an opportunity for introduction of cellulose conversion technology. We
report here that Clostridium thermocellum can solubilize over 90% of the
carbohydrate in autoclaved corn fiber, including its hemicellulose component
glucuronoarabinoxylan (GAX). However, Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum
or several other described hemicellulose-fermenting thermophilic bacteria can
only partially utilize this GAX. We describe the isolation of a previously
undescribed organism, Herbinix spp. strain LL1355, from a thermophilic microbiome
that can consume 85% of the recalcitrant GAX. We sequence its genome, and based
on structural analysis of the GAX, identify six enzymes that hydrolyze GAX
linkages. Combinations of up to four enzymes are successfully expressed in T.
thermosaccharolyticum. Supplementation with these enzymes allows T.
thermosaccharolyticum to consume 78% of the GAX compared to 53% by the parent
strain and increases ethanol yield from corn fiber by 24%.
