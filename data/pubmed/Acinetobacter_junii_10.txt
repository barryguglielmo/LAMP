Lipopeptide biosurfactants (LPBs) are amphiphilic compounds produced by
microorganisms exhibiting various biological activities. The main aim of the
present study was to assess the in vitro antimicrobial, anti-biofilm, and
cytotoxic effects of LPB produced by Acinetobacter junii (AjL). We determined AjL
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against both Gram-positive and
Gram-negative bacteria as well as two fungal strains. Also, the anti-biofilm
activity of AjL against the biofilm produced by clinically isolated bacterial
strains was investigated. The AjL non-selectively showed activity against both
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. The obtained results of the
present study exhibited that the AjL in concentrations nearly below critical
micelle concentration (CMC) has an effective antibacterial activity. It was found
that the MIC values of AjL were lower than standard antifungal and it exhibited
nearly 100% inhibition against Candida utilis. The attained results of the
biofilm formation revealed that AjL disrupted the biofilm of Proteus mirabilis,
Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1250 μg/ml and 2500 μg/ml
concentrations. The attained results of cytotoxic effect (determined by WST-1
assay) of the AjL revealed IC50 of 7.8 ± 0.4 mg/ml, 2.4 ± 0.5 mg/ml, and
5.7 ± 0.1 mg/ml, against U87, KB, and HUVEC cell lines, respectively. The results
indicated that AjL has a potential application in the relatively new field of
biomedicine.
