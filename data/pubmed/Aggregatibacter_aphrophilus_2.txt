A 48-year-old man presented with a sustained fever. Abdominal computed tomography
revealed multilocular liver abscesses. He underwent percutaneous needle
aspiration, yielding straw-colored pus. Gram staining revealed Gram-negative
coccobacilli. The organism grew only on chocolate II agar in a 7% carbon dioxide 
atmosphere. Identification of Aggregatibacter aphrophilus was confirmed using
mass spectrometry and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. He was successfully treated with 
antibiotics. Liver abscess caused by A. aphrophilus is extremely rare. We herein 
report the first such case in Japan. Even fastidious organisms, such as A.
aphrophilus, should be correctly identified using mass spectrometry or 16S rRNA
gene sequencing for adequate treatment.
