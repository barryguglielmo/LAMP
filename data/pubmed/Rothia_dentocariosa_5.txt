OBJECTIVES: Plaque causes oral diseases and aspiration-pneumonia in the elderly. 
It is not known whether pellicle-like attached salivary proteins and microbiota
on dental materials are identical to those on teeth. The purpose of this study
was to determine the properties of salivary proteins and microbiota that attach
to dental materials.
METHODS: Eight subjects wore removable oral splints with pieces of pure-titanium,
cobalt-chromium alloy, silver-palladium-copper-gold-alloy, denture-base-resin,
and hydroxyapatite for 24 h. The bacteria that adhered to each material were
analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing simultaneously. Each material sample was then 
immersed in pooled saliva, and the attached proteins were collected. Salivary
proteins were analyzed using MALDI-TOF/MS, and high molecular weight proteins
were identified using peptide mass fingerprinting.
RESULTS: Among the dental materials, the α- and β-diversity of adherent flora
were similar. The bacterial species that adhered easily to materials were
Streptococcus sp. oral taxon 058, Neisseria mucosa, Gemella haemolysans, and
Rothia dentocariosa. Regardless of material, the peaks or spots of attached
salivary proteins had similar patterns, containing functioning proteins such as
anchoring receptors for early colonizers.
CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences in microbiota and protein
adherence in hydroxyapatite compared to the dental materials. Therefore, similar 
microbiota was determined to have formed on the similar pellicle-like proteins.
In our study, the characteristics of plaque adhesion on both hydroxyapatite and
dental materials were clarified. Based on this study, the creation of new methods
of inhibiting plaque adhesion to prevent aspiration-pneumonia and oral infections
can be undertaken.
