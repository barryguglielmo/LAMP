Here, we report the draft genome sequences of Acinetobacter sp. strain EKM10A,
Enterobacter hormaechei EKM10E, and Enterobacter hormaechei EKM11E, containing
3,978,352, 4,760,222, and 4,758,163 bp, respectively. These seed
biogel-associated endophytes were previously isolated from the seed wash of
Echinocystis lobata (wild cucumber) and tested in vitro for antagonism against
soilborne fungal/oomycete pathogens.
