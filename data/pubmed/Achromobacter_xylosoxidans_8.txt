A 79-year-old man presented to a tertiary referral center from the Dominican
Republic with an opaque corneal graft and a diagnosis of chronic, recurrent
culture-positive Achromobacter xylosoxidans endophthalmitis of the left eye. The 
patient had a history of penetrating keratoplasty for Fuchs' dystrophy and had
undergone multiple intraocular surgeries including pars plana vitrectomy and
anterior chamber wash out for the diagnosis and management of chronic
endophthalmitis. After being referred, the patient underwent a third PKP, removal
of his intraocular lens (IOL), capsulectomy, and injection of intravitreal
antibiotics. All surgical specimens demonstrated the growth of A. xylosoxidans.
Five months after surgery, the graft remained clear without evidence of infection
and best-corrected visual acuity was 20/350.
