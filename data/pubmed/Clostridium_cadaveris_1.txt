Clostridium cadaveris, named following its identification in human corpses, is an
unusual pathogen. We report the first case of C. cadaveris osteomyelitis. This
case highlights the importance of deep tissue sampling and appropriate culture to
correctly identify causative pathogens and guide targeted antimicrobial therapy
in difficult-to-treat infections like chronic osteomyelitis.
