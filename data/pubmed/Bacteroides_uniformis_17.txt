A slow fermentation rate of dietary fiber could result in a steady metabolite
production release and even distribution in the entire colon, increasing the
likelihood of meeting the energy requirements of the distal colon. In the present
study, we modulated the fermentation rate in an in vitro human fecal fermentation
model by applying chemical cross-linking modification to a type 2 resistant
starch [i.e., high-amylose maize starch (HAMS)]. Cross-linking modification
decreased the gas production (an indicator of the fermentation rate) of HAMS
throughout the whole fermentation progress. The butyrate production rate of
cross-linked starches decreased gradually with the increase of the cross-linking 
degree. Certain beneficial gut microbiota such as genera of Blautia and
Clostridiales members were remarkably promoted by starches with low and medium
cross-linking degrees, whereas HAMS with a high cross-linking degree obviously
promoted the abundance of Bacteroides uniformis and Ruminococcus bromii. This
finding reveals that cross-linking modification effectively controls the
fermentation rate and highlights the modulation metabolite profiles and gut
microbiota composition through chemical modification.
