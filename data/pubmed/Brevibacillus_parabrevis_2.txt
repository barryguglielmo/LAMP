Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are biosynthetic enzymes that synthesize
natural product therapeutics using a modular synthetic logic, whereby each module
adds one aminoacyl substrate to the nascent peptide. We have determined five
x-ray crystal structures of large constructs of the NRPS linear gramicidin
synthetase, including a structure of a full core dimodule in conformations
organized for the condensation reaction and intermodular peptidyl substrate
delivery. The structures reveal differences in the relative positions of adjacent
modules, which are not strictly coupled to the catalytic cycle and are consistent
with small-angle x-ray scattering data. The structures and covariation analysis
of homologs allowed us to create mutants that improve the yield of a peptide from
a module-swapped dimodular NRPS.
