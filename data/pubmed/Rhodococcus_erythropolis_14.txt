Quantification of polyamines, including putrescine, is generally performed using 
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or gas chromatography. However,
these methods are time-consuming because of sample derivatization and analytical 
reagent preparation. In this study, we developed a simple and high-throughput
putrescine quantification method on a 96-well microtiter plate using putrescine
oxidase from Rhodococcus erythropolis NCIMB 11540, peroxidase, 4-aminoantipyrine,
and N-ethyl-N-(3-sulfopropyl)-3-methylaniline sodium salt. The developed method
(named as PuO-POD-4AA-TOPS method) was applicable to bacterial culture
supernatants. Furthermore, putrescine concentrations determined by the developed 
method roughly corresponded to the concentrations determined by HPLC.
