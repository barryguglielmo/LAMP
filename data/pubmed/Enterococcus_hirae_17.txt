AIMS: This study was conducted to early detect the negative culture bacterial
pathogens causing subclinical mastitis for the fast diagnosis of the disease and 
the reduction of some milk-transmitted pathogenic bacteria to human consumers.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 171 positive California mastitis test (CMT) milk 
samples collected from asymptomatic dairy cows in Sharkia Governorate, Egypt were
examined by conventional bacteriological methods. The obtained results revealed
that Streptococcus species (77·2%), followed by Staphylococcus species (48·6%)
and Escherichia coli (25·7%) were the most predominant bacterial pathogens
isolated from positive culture milk samples, whereas Enterobacter and Pseudomonas
species were the lowest ones (1·2%, for each). Herein, 13 (7.6%) negative culture
milk samples were subjected to propidium monoazide (PMA) conventional PCR assay, 
followed by DNA sequencing of purified PCR amplicons. Sequence analysis
identified seven different types of negative culture bacterial pathogens
comprising as following; 4 Enterococcus hirae, 2 Bacillus cereus, 2
Staphylococcus aureus, 1 Bacillus mycoides, 1 Bacillus subtilis, 1 Enterococcus
faecium and 1 Escherichia coli.
CONCLUSIONS: All the detected negative culture bacterial pathogens by PMA-PCR
assay, followed by DNA sequencing were incriminated in causing subclinical
mastitis disease and had serious implications on human public health through
consumption of milk contaminated with those recovered bacterial pathogens.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The used methods could be useful in the
routine detection of negative culture bacterial pathogens present in milk and
consequently, it will help in the rapid diagnosis of subclinical mastitis disease
and the reduction of many milk-transmitted diseases to human.
