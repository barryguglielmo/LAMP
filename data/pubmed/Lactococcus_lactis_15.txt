We announce the draft genome sequences of six strains of Lactococcus lactis
(EKM101L, EKM102L, EKM201L, EKM203L, EKM501L, and EKM502L). These candidate plant
probiotics were isolated from surface-sterilized seeds of Cucumis sativus L.
(cucumber), Cucumis melo L. (cantaloupe), and Cucurbita pepo var. turbinate
(acorn squash). They display beneficial activities, including biocontrol.
