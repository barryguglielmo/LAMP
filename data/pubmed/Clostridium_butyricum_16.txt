Gut dysbiosis caused by antibiotics impairs response to immune checkpoint
blockade (ICB). Gut microbiota is becoming an attractive therapeutic target for
cancer. The Clostridium butyricum MIYAIRI 588 strain is a probiotic therapy used 
to improve symptoms related to antibiotic-induced dysbiosis in Japan. We
hypothesized that probiotic Clostridium butyricum therapy (CBT) may affect the
therapeutic efficacy of ICBs. We retrospectively evaluated 118 patients with
advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with ICBs at Kumamoto University
Hospital (Kumamoto-shi, Kumamoto, Japan). Survival analysis comparing patients
given CBT before and/or after ICB was conducted using univariate analyses and Cox
proportional hazards regression models using propensity score. Propensity score
analyses confirmed that probiotic CBT significantly prolonged progression-free
survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Probiotic CBT significantly associated 
with longer PFS and OS even in patients who received antibiotic therapy. This
study suggests that probiotic CBT may have a positive impact on therapeutic
efficacy of ICB in patients with cancer.See articles by Hakozaki et al., p. 1243,
