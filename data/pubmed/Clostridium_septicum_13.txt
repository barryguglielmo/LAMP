BACKGROUND: Clostridium septicum aortitis is a lethal infection. C. septicum has 
a strong association with an underlying malignancy, most commonly in the colon.
AIM: Early identification methods and management strategies of C. Septicum
infection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present a 64-year-old man with aortic aneurysm and C.
septicum bacteremia with unknown malignancy who passed away on the fourth day of 
hospitalization despite emergent endovascular intervention. Computed tomography
showed periaortic gas which is the hallmark of infection.
DISCUSSION: This case report highlights the need of prompt surgical treatment and
its different modalities along with the early use of appropriate antibiotics due 
to the rapid spread of infection associated with high fatality. The authors also 
discuss the association of C. septicum aortitis with underlying occult
malignancies.
CONCLUSION: Delay in identification and treatment of C. Septicum is associated
with very high mortality rates.
