BACKGROUND: The Streptococcus anginosus group (SAG, S. anginosus, S. intermedius 
and S. constellatus) are often associated with severe disease and abscess
formation. In our institution, we observed an apparent increase in frequency of
intraorbital and intracranial infections resulting from SAG at Texas Children's
Hospital. We undertook a retrospective review to describe the frequency and
clinical features of these infections.
METHODS: We reviewed the database of the microbiology laboratory at Texas
Children's Hospital from 2011 to 2018 for SAG-positive cultures. Cases included
were those associated with (1) either otitis media or sinusitis and (2) Pott's
puffy tumor, orbital abscesses, mastoiditis, epidural abscesses, subdural
empyema, brain parenchymal abscesses or dural enhancement by imaging. The number 
of overall diagnoses were determined using diagnostic codes and used to estimate 
the proportion of disease caused by SAG.
RESULTS: Ninety-five cases were identified meeting inclusion criteria. The median
age of patients was 11.4 years, and 75.8% were previously healthy. S. intermedius
was most commonly isolated (80%) followed by S. constellatus (12.6%) and S.
anginosus (7.4%); 50.5% of cases were polymicrobial. Among polymicrobial cases,
Staphylococcus aureus was most frequently isolated. All patients underwent
surgical intervention. 8.4% of patients experienced persistent neurologic
deficits. We observed a significant increase in disease incidence during the
study period; in addition, the overall proportion of all intracranial infections 
caused by SAG increased.
CONCLUSIONS: Complications of otitis media and sinusitis caused by SAG are
associated with substantial morbidity. These infections are becoming increasingly
common at our center although the precise reason for this temporal trend is
unclear.
