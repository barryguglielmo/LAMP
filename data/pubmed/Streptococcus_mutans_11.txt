The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of sodium
trimetaphosphate (TMP), associated or not with fluoride (F), on the
concentrations of F, calcium (Ca), and phosphorus (P) and on the pH of mixed
biofilms of Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans, before and after exposure 
to sucrose. The biofilms received three treatments (72, 78, and 96 h after the
beginning of their formation), at three TMP concentrations (0.25, 0.5, or 1%),
with or without F at 500 ppm. Solutions containing 500 and 1,100 ppm F as well as
artificial saliva were also tested as controls. Biofilm pH was measured and the
concentrations of F, Ca, and P were determined (solid and fluid phases). In a
parallel experiment, after the third treatment (96 h), the biofilms were exposed 
to a 20% sucrose solution to simulate a cariogenic challenge and the pH of the
medium, F, Ca, P, and TMP were determined. The data were submitted by two-way
ANOVA, followed by Fisher's least significant difference test (p < 0.05).
Treatment with TMP and 500 ppm F led to higher F concentration in the biofilm
fluid. Although TMP did not affect Ca concentrations, biofilms treated with TMP
alone presented higher P concentrations. Treatment with 1% TMP and F led to the
highest pH values of the biofilm, both before and after the cariogenic challenge.
It was concluded that TMP increases F and P in the biofilm and that its presence 
promotes an increase in the pH of the medium, even after the cariogenic
challenge.
