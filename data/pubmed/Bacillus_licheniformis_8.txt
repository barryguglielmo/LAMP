In this study soluble soybean polysaccharide‑iron(III) (SSPS-Fe(III)) was
synthesized to investigate the effects on the growth of Escherichia coli,
Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus licheniformis. Two new detection methods of
real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and
microcalorimetry were used to evaluate the effects of different concentrations of
SSPS-Fe(III) on the growth of three bacteria. The copy numbers of three bacteria 
showed that SSPS-Fe(III) had different impacts on the growth of E. coli, S.
aureus and B. licheniformis. E. coli growth was inhibited by SSPS-Fe(III) in the 
higher concentration range and S. aureus growth was inhibited at any
concentration, however B. licheniformis growth was promoted. The thermogenic
curves for growth metabolism of E. coli and S. aureus presented peak shapes while
those of B. licheniformis did platform shapes. As SSPS-Fe(III) concentration
increased, the peak heights lowered for E. coli and S. aureus, and the time
reaching stationary phase advanced for B. licheniformis. These findings
demonstrate that SSPS-Fe(III) has an inhibitory effect on the foodborne pathogens
of E. coli and S. aureus, and an enhancement on the probiotics of B.
licheniformis.
