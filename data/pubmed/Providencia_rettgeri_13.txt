We report the case of a 74-year-old male, with a medical history of cor
triatriatum, admitted with a 10-day history of intermittent fever. Three sets of 
blood cultures were positive for Providencia rettgeri. Transthoracic and
transesophageal echocardiogram excluded infective endocarditis, but revealed a
congenital accessory tissue adhering to the mitral valve, causing supravalvular
mitral stenosis. Cor triatriatum sinistrum is a rare congenital cardiac anomaly, 
even more uncommon in adults, and quite exceptional when associated with mitral
valve disease. Because the patient had no symptoms related to the heart valve
disease, no surgical indication was given and he was managed conservatively.
