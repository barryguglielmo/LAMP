BACKGROUND: Eubacterium rectale is one of the most prevalent human gut bacteria, 
but its diversity and population genetics are not well understood because
large-scale whole-genome investigations of this microbe have not been carried
out.
RESULTS: Here, we leverage metagenomic assembly followed by a reference-based
binning strategy to screen over 6500 gut metagenomes spanning geography and
lifestyle and reconstruct over 1300 E. rectale high-quality genomes from
metagenomes. We extend previous results of biogeographic stratification,
identifying a new subspecies predominantly found in African individuals and
showing that closely related non-human primates do not harbor E. rectale.
Comparison of pairwise genetic and geographic distances between subspecies
suggests that isolation by distance and co-dispersal with human populations might
have contributed to shaping the contemporary population structure of E. rectale. 
We confirm that a relatively recently diverged E. rectale subspecies specific to 
Europe consistently lacks motility operons and that it is immotile in vitro,
probably due to ancestral genetic loss. The same subspecies exhibits expansion of
its carbohydrate metabolism gene repertoire including the acquisition of a
genomic island strongly enriched in glycosyltransferase genes involved in
exopolysaccharide synthesis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides new insights into the population structure and
ecology of E. rectale and shows that shotgun metagenomes can enable population
genomics studies of microbiota members at a resolution and scale previously
attainable only by extensive isolate sequencing.
