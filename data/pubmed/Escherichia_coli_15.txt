The 3rd E. coli and the Mucosal Immune System (ECMIS) meeting was held at Ghent
University in Belgium from June 2-5, 2019. It brought together an international
group of scientists interested in mechanisms of colonization, host response, and 
vaccine development. ECMIS distinguishes itself from related meetings on these
enteropathogens by providing a greater emphasis on animal health and disease, and
covering a broad range of pathotypes including enterohemorrhagic,
enteropathogenic, enterotoxigenic, enteroaggregative, and extraintestinal
pathogenic E. coli As it is well-established that the genus Shigella represents a
subspecies of E. coli, these organisms along with related enteroinvasive E. coli 
are also included. In addition, Tannerella forsythia, a periodontal pathogen, was
presented as an example of a pathogen which uses its surface glycans for mucosal 
interaction. This review summarizes several highlights from the 2019 meeting and 
major advances to our understanding of the biology of these pathogens and their
impact on the host.
