Lentibacillus sp. strain JNUCC-1 was isolated from Korean traditionally fermented
anchovy sauce. The 16S rRNA sequence of JNUCC-1 showed 95.2% and 95.1% similarity
to Lentibacillus populi WD4L-1T and Virgibacillus siamensis MS3-4T, respectively,
indicating that it is a novel species. The whole-genome sequence, which contains 
3,687,469 bp and 3,833 genes in 3 contigs, is reported.
