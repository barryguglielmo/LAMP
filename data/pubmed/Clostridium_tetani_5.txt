Tetanus is a life-threatening but vaccine-preventable disease caused by the toxin
of the bacterium Clostridium tetani and is characterized by muscle spasms and
autonomic nervous system dysfunction. It is prevented through vaccination with
tetanus toxoid, but because the causative agent is widespread in the environment,
eradication is impossible. Therefore, efforts to reduce incidence are aimed at
reaching elimination, rather than eradication. This article reviews the
pathogenesis, clinical manifestation and treatment of tetanus, and summarizes all
recommendations from CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)
regarding prevention and control of tetanus in the United States.
