Epidemiological surveillance of Shigella spp. in Australia is conducted to inform
public health response. Multi-drug resistance has recently emerged as a
contributing factor to sustained local transmission of Shigella spp. All data
were collected as part of routine public health surveillance, and strains were
whole-genome sequenced for further molecular characterisation. 108 patients with 
an endemic regional Shigella flexneri strain were identified between 2016 and
2019. The S. flexneri phylogroup 3 strain endemic to northern Australia acquired 
a multi-drug resistance conferring blaDHA plasmid, which has an IncFII plasmid
backbone with virulence and resistance elements typically found in IncR plasmids.
This is the first report of multi-drug resistance in Shigella sp. in Australia
that is not associated with men who have sex with men. This strain caused an
outbreak of multi-drug-resistant S. flexneri in northern Australia that
disproportionality affects Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children.
Community controlled public health action is recommended.
