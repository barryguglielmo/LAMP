Group II introns are ubiquitous self-splicing ribozymes and retrotransposable
elements evolutionarily and chemically related to the eukaryotic spliceosome,
with potential applications as gene-editing tools. Recent biochemical and
structural data have captured the intron in multiple conformations at different
stages of catalysis. Here, we employ enzymatic assays, X-ray crystallography, and
molecular simulations to resolve the spatiotemporal location and function of
conformational changes occurring between the first and the second step of
splicing. We show that the first residue of the highly-conserved catalytic triad 
is protonated upon 5'-splice-site scission, promoting a reversible structural
rearrangement of the active site (toggling). Protonation and active site dynamics
induced by the first step of splicing facilitate the progression to the second
step. Our insights into the mechanism of group II intron splicing parallels
functional data on the spliceosome, thus reinforcing the notion that these
evolutionarily-related molecular machines share the same enzymatic strategy.
