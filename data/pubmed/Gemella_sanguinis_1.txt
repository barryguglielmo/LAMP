INTRODUCTION: Gemella sanguinis is an extremely rare cause of infectious
endocarditis, with only 12 cases previously reported in the literature. Here we
report the third known case of isolated mitral valve endocarditis secondary to G.
sanguinis.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 53-year-old man with mitral valve prolapse and history of
recent dental instrumentation presented with malaise, thigh and finger pain and
new pansystolic murmur. He was diagnosed with severe mitral insufficiency due to 
infectious endocarditis secondary to G. sanguinis. He underwent mitral valve
replacement and was treated with a long course of antibiotics.
DISCUSSION: G. sanguinis is a rare cause of infectious endocarditis with very few
reported cases in the literature. In the majority of reported cases, a strategy
of valve replacement along with prolonged antibiotic course results in good
outcome for the patient.
