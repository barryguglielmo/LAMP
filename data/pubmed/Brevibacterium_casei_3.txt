Despite its low virulence potential and a commensal lifestyle as a member of the 
human skin microbiota, Brevibacterium casei has been increasingly reported as an 
opportunistic pathogen, especially in immunocompromised patients. Here, we
present the draft genome sequence of the S51 strain isolated from a bloodstream
infection. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of the
draft genome sequence of the B. casei strain isolated from the clinical
infection. The strain was identified using phenotypic and molecular methods and
subsequently sequenced using the next-generation sequencing. The draft whole
genome was assembled de novo, automatically annotated by Rapid Annotations using 
Subsystems Technology (RAST) server and scrutinized to predict the presence of
virulence, resistance, and stress response proteins. The genome size of the S51
strain was 3,743,532 bp and an average G+C content was 68.3%. The predicted genes
included 48 genes involved in resistance to antibiotics (including vancomycin,
fluoroquinolones, and beta-lactams) and toxic compounds (heavy metals), 16 genes 
involved in invasion and intracellular resistance (Mycobacterium virulence
operons), and 94 genes involved in stress response (osmotic, oxidative stress,
cold and heat shock). ResFinder has indicated the presence of a beta-lactamase,
and a phenotypic analysis showed resistance to penicillin. This whole-genome NGS 
project for the S51strain has been deposited at EMBL/GenBank under the accession 
no. QNGF00000000.
