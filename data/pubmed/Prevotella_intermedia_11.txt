Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) are one of the major causes of cancer
morbidity and mortality worldwide. Dental microbiome has been considered as
inducing agents in oral carcinogenesis. Therefore, the objective of this study
was to investigate the interaction of the gene expression of the dental
microbiome and OSCC patients. A cross-sectional study was designed by recruiting 
confirmed OSCC patients attending the University hospital during October 2018 and
July 2019. The dental bacteria were isolated and confirmed by PCR technique. The 
expression of host and bacterial virulence genes was determined using qPCR. This 
study shows that 54% of T. forsythia found to be the most predominant organisms
in 30 positive cases, followed by 34% of Campylobacter rectus and 29% of
Prevotella intermedia. The expression of mRNA levels of bspA, csxA, fadA and
interpain A in the OSCC- bacteria positive cases was significantly higher than
the control group (P < 0.001). It was further found that interpainA, csxA, fadA, 
and bspA genes have the potential effects on the cellular gene expression in OSCC
patients. A significant correlation was seen between expression patterns of
CXCL10, DIAPH1, NCLN and MMP9 genes with interpain A, fadA, and bspA involved in 
OSCC cases The results indicate that the species specific bacteria may play a
role in triggering chronic inflammation in OSCC patients. Therefore, alteration
in the gene expression through the dental microbiome could be used as an
alternative target in the clinical practice to detect OSCC.
