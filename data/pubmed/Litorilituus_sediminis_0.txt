A Gram-stain negative, rod-shaped, aerobic, oxidase-positive and catalase-weakly 
positive bacterial strain with polar or subpolar flagellum, designated RZ04T, was
isolated from an intertidal sand sample collected from a coastal area of the
Yellow Sea, China. The organism was observed to grow optimally at 25 °C and pH
6.5-7.0 with 2% (w/v) NaCl. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene
sequences revealed that strain RZ04T was closely related to Colwellia asteriadis 
(similarity 96.9%) and Litorilituus sediminis (similarity 96.8%), and 94.4-96.4% 
sequence similarities to other type strains of species of the genera belonged to 
the family Colwelliaceae. The dominant fatty acids of strain RZ04T were
determined to be C17:1ω8c, C15:1ω8c, C16:0 and summed feature 3 (C16:1ω6c and/or 
C16:1ω7c), and the predominant isoprenoid quinone was determined to be quinone 8 
(Q-8). Phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, an unidentified
aminophospholipid and four unidentified lipids were determined to be the major
constituents of the polar lipids. The genome of strain RZ04T is 4.14 Mbp with a
G + C content of 37.4 mol%. A total of 3631 genes are predicted, with 3531
protein-coding genes, 75 RNA genes and 25 pseudogenes. Based on phenotypic,
genotypic and phylogenetic analysis, strain RZ04T is considered to represent a
novel species in the genus Litorilituus, for which the name Litorilituus
lipolyticus is proposed. The type strain is RZ04T (= MCCC 1K03616T = KCTC
62835T). An emended description of Colwellia asteriadis is also provided.
