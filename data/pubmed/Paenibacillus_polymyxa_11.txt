Polymyxins are used as the last-line therapy against multidrug-resistant
bacteria. However, their further clinical development needs to solve problems
related to the presence of heterogeneous analogs, but there is still no platform 
or methods that can regulate the biosynthesis of polymyxin analogs. In this
study, we present an approach to swap domains in the polymyxin gene cluster to
regulate the production of different analogs. Following adenylation domain
swapping, the proportion of polymyxin B1 increased from 41.36 to 52.90%, while
that of B1-1 decreased from 18.25 to 3.09%. The ratio of polymyxin B1 and B3
following starter condensation domain swapping changed from 41.36 and 16.99 to
55.03 and 6.39%, respectively. The two domain-swapping strains produced 62.96% of
polymyxin B1, 6.70% of B3 and 3.32% of B1-1. This study also revealed the
presence of overflow fluxes between acetoin, 2,3-butanediol and polymyxin. To our
best knowledge, this is the first report of engineering the polymyxin synthetase 
gene cluster in situ to regulate the relative proportions of polymyxin analogs.
This research paves a way for regulating lipopeptide analogs and will facilitate 
the development of novel lipopeptide derivatives.
