Streptococcus mitis strain Nm-65 secretes an atypical 5-domain-type
cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC) called S. mitis-derived human platelet
aggregation factor (Sm-hPAF) originally described as a platelet aggregation
factor. Sm-hPAF belongs to Group III CDC that recognize both membrane cholesterol
and human CD59 as the receptors, and shows preferential activity towards human
cells. Draft genome analyses have shown that the Nm-65 strain also harbors a gene
encoding another CDC called mitilysin (MLY). This CDC belongs to Group I CDC that
recognizes only membrane cholesterol as a receptor, and it is a homolog of the
pneumococcal CDC, pneumolysin. The genes encoding each CDC are located about
20 kb apart on the Nm-65 genome. Analysis of the genomic locus of these
CDC-encoding genes in silico showed that the gene encoding Sm-hPAF and the region
including the gene encoding MLY were both inserted into a specific locus of the
S. mitis genome. The results obtained using deletion mutants of the gene(s)
encoding CDC in Nm-65 indicated that each CDC contributes to both hemolysis and
cytotoxicity, and that MLY is the major hemolysin/cytolysin in Nm-65. The present
study aimed to determine the potential pathogenicity of an S. mitis strain that
produces two CDC with different receptor recognition properties and secretion
modes.
