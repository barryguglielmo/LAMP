Both pathogenic as well as nonpathogenic species of staphylococci have been
reported in poultry, but these studies have not compared staphylococcal flora of 
both farmed and household broiler chickens. Staphylococci from farmed (n = 51)
and household chicken intestines (n = 43) were isolated and tested for resistance
to antimicrobials, presence of resistance genes, and inhibitory activity against 
other bacteria; correlation of resistance phenotype and genotype was also
evaluated. At least 12 staphylococcal species were identified; Staphylococcus
carnosus subspecies carnosus was the predominant species from both sources. Most 
farmed chicken staphylococci were resistant to tigecycline (38/51; 74.8%) while
the highest level of resistance among the household chicken staphylococci was to 
clindamycin (31/43; 72.1%). The mecA gene was only detected in staphylococci from
household chickens, whereas ermC and tetK or tetM were found in staphylococci
from both groups of birds. Multidrug resistance (resistance ≥ 2 antimicrobial
classes) was observed in 88% of resistant staphylococci ranging from 2 to 8
classes and up to 10 antimicrobials. Isolates produced inhibitory activity
against 7 clinical bacterial strains primarily Enterococcus faecalis (25/88;
28.4%) and Escherichia coli (22/88; 25%). This study demonstrated that the
staphylococcal population among farmed and household chickens varies by species
and resistance to antimicrobials. These results may reflect the influence of the 
environment or habitat of each bird type on the intestinal microflora. As
resistance in the staphylococci to antimicrobials used to treat human infections 
was detected, further study is warranted to determine strategies to prevent
transfer of these resistant populations to humans via contamination of the
poultry meat.
