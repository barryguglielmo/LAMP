Idiopathic central precocious puberty (ICPP) is a relatively common condition in 
preadolescent girls, and its pathogenesis remains to be uncovered. A variety of
studies have highlighted the association of gut microbiota (GM) with endocrine
diseases, such as obesity, which is commonly associated with ICPP. However, the
relationship between GM and ICPP remains unexplored. Feces samples were collected
from 25 girls with ICPP (ICPP group) and 23 healthy girls (Control group). We
applied 16S rDNA sequencing to compare the GM between two groups. The ICPP group 
had higher GM diversity and was enriched for several GM species, including
Ruminococcus gnavus, Ruminococcus callidus, Ruminococcus bromii, Roseburia
inulinivorans, Coprococcus eutactus, Clostridium leptum, and Clostridium
lactatifermentans, which are known to be associated with obesity and are related 
to the production of short-chain fatty acids. Additionally, 36 candidate GM
biomarkers for patients with ICPP screening were identified with high accuracy
(AUC = 0.95, 95% CI 0.88 to 1). We observed that the GM of the ICPP group was
enriched for the microbial functions of cell motility, signal transduction, and
environmental adaptation. Positive correlations were also detected between
Fusobacterium and follicle-stimulating hormone, and Gemmiger and luteinizing
hormone. This study documents relationships between GM and ICPP, and the
implication of these findings remains to be determined.
