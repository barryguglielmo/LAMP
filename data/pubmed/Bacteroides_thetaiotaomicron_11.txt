Bacteria of the genus Bacteroides are common members of the human intestinal
microbiota and important degraders of polysaccharides in the gut. Among them, the
species Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron has emerged as the model organism for
functional microbiota research. Here, we use differential RNA sequencing
(dRNA-seq) to generate a single-nucleotide resolution transcriptome map of B.
thetaiotaomicron grown under defined laboratory conditions. An online browser,
called 'Theta-Base' ( www.helmholtz-hiri.de/en/datasets/bacteroides ), is
launched to interrogate the obtained gene expression data and annotations of
~4500 transcription start sites, untranslated regions, operon structures, and 269
noncoding RNA elements. Among the latter is GibS, a conserved, 145 nt-long small 
RNA that is highly expressed in the presence of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine as sole
carbon source. We use computational predictions and experimental data to
determine the secondary structure of GibS and identify its target genes. Our
results indicate that sensing of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine induces GibS expression, 
which in turn modifies the transcript levels of metabolic enzymes.
