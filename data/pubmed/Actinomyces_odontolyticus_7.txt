Renal actinomycosis is a rare clinical entity. Diagnosis is usually made after
resection. A 36-year-old male presented with uro-cutaneous fistula and left
xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. He was offered left open radical nephrectomy.
Intra-operatively, there was "woody" inflammation of the left kidney fistulizing 
to the splenic flexure of the colon. We successfully resected it and a segment of
the colon that had fistulized. His tissue cultures grew Actinomyces
odontolyticus. Post-operatively, he received 6 weeks of intravenous beta-lactam
antibiotic. He recovered well without any complications. In conclusion, renal
actinomycosis can be challenging to diagnose, operate and eradicate.
Perioperative considerations are presented for successful management.
