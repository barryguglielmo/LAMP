Non-Escherichia coli Enterobacterales (NECE) can colonize the human gut and may
present virulence determinants and phenotypes that represent severe heath
concerns. Most information is available for virulent NECE strains, isolated from 
patients with an ongoing infection, while the commensal NECE population of
healthy subjects is understudied. In this study, 32 NECE strains were isolated
from the feces of 20 healthy adults. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and mass
spectrometry attributed the isolates to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella
oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter kobei,
Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter amalonaticus, Cronobacter sp., and Hafnia
alvei, Morganella morganii, and Serratia liquefaciens. Multiplex PCR revealed
that K. pneumoniae harbored virulence genes for adhesins (mrkD, ycfM, and kpn)
and enterobactin (entB) and, in one case, also for yersiniabactin (ybtS, irp1,
irp2, and fyuA). Virulence genes were less numerous in the other NECE species.
Biofilm formation was spread across all the species, while curli and cellulose
were mainly produced by Citrobacter and Enterobacter. Among the most common
antibiotics, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was the sole against which resistance
was observed, only Klebsiella strains being susceptible. The NECE inhabiting the 
intestine of healthy subjects have traits that may pose a health threat, taking
into account the possibility of horizontal gene transfer.
