An 83-year-old man visited an orthopedic hospital for his lower back pain. A
compression fracture was noted in his second lumbar vertebra. He had taken pain
medication for approximately five weeks, but the pain had worsened and he was
unable to walk by himself. He was transferred to our hospital and diagnosed with 
lumbar spondylodiscitis, an iliopsoas abscess, gas gangrene of his left lower
limb, and left massive pleural effusion. He was admitted to the intensive care
unit. We drained the abscess and pleural effusion, provided continuous
hemodiafiltration under ventilator control, and administered intravenous
antibiotics. However, he died from sepsis and multiple organ failure three days
following admission. Several days after his death, gram-positive cocci were
identified in blood culture, pus from the abscess, and pleural exudate; although 
the causative organism could not be identified. Two weeks subsequent to his
death, 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing identified Parvimonas micra in specimens
taken from his body.
