Vascular complications from a liver abscess are rare but life-threatening.
Herein, we report the case of a man in his 40s with a pyogenic hepatic abscess
complicated by an inferior vena caval thrombus extending to the right atrium. His
presenting complaint was a high fever. Blood tests revealed elevated inflammatory
markers and liver enzymes. An abdominal CT demonstrated a 10cm abscess in the
right hepatic lobe. A blood culture grew Streptococcus intermedius, which was
sensitive to ampicillin sulbactam. He was diagnosed with a pyogenic liver abscess
and treated with metronidazole and ampicillin sulbactam. Three days following
admission, an abdominal CT scan revealed the thrombus extending from the liver
abscess into the right atrium. He underwent thrombectomy and received antibiotic 
therapy. Postoperatively, abdominal ultrasound revealed a significant decrease in
the size of the hepatic abscess. The patient was discharged in good condition on 
the 46th day of hospitalization. When encountering a hepatic abscess, it is
important to consider that it may be associated with a thrombus extending from
the inferior vena cava into right atrium.
