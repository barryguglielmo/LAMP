Two Pseudomonas strains were isolated from the strawberry leaves. The O-antigens 
were obtained using phenol-water method and mild acid degradation. The following 
structures of the O-polysaccharides were established by sugar analysis and 2D NMR
spectroscopy: OPS of Pseudomonas koreensis BIM B-970G
→3)-α-D-FucNAcp-(1 → 2)-β-D-Quip3NAc-(1 → 3)-α-L-6dTalp4OAc-(1→ OPS of
Pseudomonas oryzihabitans BIM B-1072G
→4)-α-L-FucpNAm3OAc-(1 → 3)-α-D-QuipNAc-(1 → 4)-β-D-GlcpNAc3NAcA-(1→ Where Am -
