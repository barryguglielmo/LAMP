OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis
HN019 (HN019) on clinical periodontal parameters (plaque accumulation and
gingival bleeding), on immunocompetence of gingival tissues [expression of
beta-defensin (BD)-3, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), cluster of
differentiation(CD)-57 and CD-4], and on immunological properties of saliva (IgA 
levels) in non-surgical periodontal therapy in generalized chronic periodontitis 
(GCP) patients. Adhesion to buccal epithelial cells (BEC) and the antimicrobial
properties of HN019 were also investigated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients were recruited and monitored clinically at
baseline (before scaling and root planing-SRP) and after 30 and 90 days. Patients
were randomly assigned to Test (SRP+Probiotic, n = 15) or Control (SRP+Placebo, n
= 15) group. Probiotic lozenges were used for 30 days. Gingival tissues and
saliva were immunologically analyzed. The adhesion of HN019 with or without
Porphyromonas gingivalis in BEC and its antimicrobial properties were
investigated in in vitro assays. Data were statistically analyzed (p<0.05).
RESULTS: Test group presented lower plaque index (30 days) and lower marginal
gingival bleeding (90 days) when compared with Control group. Higher BD-3, TLR4
and CD-4 expressions were observed in gingival tissues in Test group than in
Control group. HN019 reduced the adhesion of P. gingivalis to BEC and showed
antimicrobial potential against periodontopathogens.
CONCLUSION: Immunological and antimicrobial properties of B. lactis HN019 make it
a potential probiotic to be used in non-surgical periodontal therapy of patients 
with GCP.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: B. lactis HN019 may be a potential probiotic to improve the
effects of non-surgical periodontal therapy. Name of the registry and
registration number (ClinicalTrials.gov): "Effects of probiotic therapy in the
treatment of periodontitis"-NCT03408548.
