OJD is no longer the serious animal health issue that it was for many Australian 
rural communities a decade and a half ago. Despite declining OJD prevalence as
determined by abattoir surveillance, the disease continues to spread, with OJD
extension programs required to continually address the misinformation promulgated
by some disaffected producers as new areas have become affected. Improved
regional and on-farm biosecurity, including the introduction of a risk-based
trading system, may have contributed to improved attitudes to OJD control,
although attitudinal differences between OJD endemic areas and where the disease 
is not well established remain. Declines in on-farm OJD prevalence are almost
certainly attributable to the widespread uptake of vaccination programs, although
encouraging the ongoing use of vaccination to prevent recrudescence and improved 
biosecurity when mortalities disappear, remains challenging. Vaccination has
provided a robust strategy for managing OJD and contributed significantly to the 
health of Australian sheep and the lives of producers with affected properties.
As vaccination offers a pathway to reduce the risk of MAP infection entering the 
human food chain from small ruminant products, it should be more widely adopted
globally, accompanied by research efforts to improve efficacy and importantly,
the safety of vaccination to both operators and livestock.
