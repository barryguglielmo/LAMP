Microbial electroactivity, the metabolically relevant transfer of electrons
between microorganisms and solid conductors, was first discovered for now well
characterized model organisms from hypoxic or anaerobic water or sediment
samples. Recent findings indicate that the metabolic trait of electroactivity
might as well be important within the microbiome of the mammalian gut. Based on a
pre-selection from the mouse intestinal bacterial collection five microorganisms 
originating from diverse parts of the gut were screened for electroactivity. As
there is no marker gene for electroactivity, the ability to synthesize
cytochromes and metabolize redox-mediators was studied in-silico. Clostridium
cochlearium showed highest electroactivity and Lactobacillus reuteri as well as
Staphylococcus xylosus show putative electroactivity, as well. The maximum
current density of C. cochlearium of 0.53 ± 0.02 mA cm-2 after only 5.2 h of
incubation was clearly linked to growth and glucose consumption. Cyclic
voltammetric analysis on C. cochlearium revealed a formal potential of the
extracellular electron transfer (EET) site of +0.22 ± 0.05 V versus Ag/AgCl sat. 
KCl (and + 0.42 V versus SHE) and indicates that EET is not based on biofilm
formation, but the involvement of either redox-active molecules or planktonic
cells. The potential of the gut as habitat for electroactives and their
physiological role are discussed.
