Abiotophia defectiva (A. defectiva) infectious endocarditis (IE) is a serious
disease that usually requires lengthy treatment with a combination of amoxicillin
and gentamicin. Since severe nephrotoxicity can be associated with prolonged
administration of gentamicin, the alternative use of daptomycin in combination
with amoxicillin can be considered. We present the case of a 51-year-old man that
presented an A. defectiva endocarditis on an aortic bicuspidy. Diagnosis of
cirrhosis was made simultaneously, and therefore gentamicin was
counter-indicated. A combination of amoxicillin 12 g per day and daptomycin
700 mg (10 mg/kg) was administrated, with resolution of clinical, biological and 
echographic abnormalities, and no relapse after 1 year. In our experience,
amoxicillin with daptomycin could be an alternative in case of A. defectiva IE
with counter-indication to aminoglycosides.
