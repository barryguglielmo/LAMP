Mammary serum amyloid A3 (M-SAA3) has shown potential in stimulating innate
immunity during intramammary infections, at calving and at dryoff. In this study,
we produced recombinant caprine M-SAA3 to test its ability to reduce intramammary
infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus
dysgalactiae, and Escherichia coli, which are all common mastitis-producing
pathogens. Recombinant production of M-SAA3 (followed by lipopolysaccharide
removal to avoid lipopolysaccharide-nonspecific stimulation of the immune system)
was successfully achieved. Mammary serum amyloid A3 stimulated the expression of 
IL-8 in a dose-dependent manner in primary mammary cultures. Although a direct
killing effect on Staph. aureus by M-SAA3 was not detected, this acute phase
protein was able to reduce Staph. aureus, Strep. uberis, and Strep. dysgalactiae 
infections by up to 50% and induced a reduction in E. coli counts of 67%. In
general, the best concentration of caprine M-SAA3 for inhibiting infections was
the lowest concentration tested (10 μg/mL), although higher concentrations (up to
160 μg/mL) increased its antimicrobial potential against some pathogens.
