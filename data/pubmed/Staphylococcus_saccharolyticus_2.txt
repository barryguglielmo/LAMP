BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus saccharolyticus is a rare cause of human infectious
disease. The clinical characteristics and treatment of patients with S
saccharolyticus infections remain largely unknown.
OBJECTIVES: We present the first reported case of empyema due to S
saccharolyticus. In addition, a systematic review and pooled analysis of all S
saccharolyticus cases were done to summarize the clinical and microbiological
characteristics and treatment of this rare pathogen.
METHODS: A case of empyema caused by S saccharolyticus diagnosed in study
hospital was reported. This case and those identified from PubMed, EMBASE, and
Web of Science were analyzed.
RESULTS: In total, 8 patients were reviewed. The averages of the white blood cell
count, sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein were 16.8 × 10/L, 72 mm/h, and 
176 mg/L, respectively. The average time-to-positivity of the anaerobic cultures 
was 5 days. The S saccharolyticus was resistant to metronidazole, but susceptible
to fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, and vancomycin in all the cases with drug
sensitivity tests available for these antibiotics. Two of 7 patients showed
resistance to all β-lactams. Both of those patients finally died.
CONCLUSIONS: S saccharolyticus should be added to the list of anaerobic
microorganisms that are able to cause empyema. A prolonged anaerobic culture is
critical to improve the yield of this possibly underestimated pathogen. The time 
to positive culture of S saccharolyticus may not help to distinguish
true-positive growth from contaminated growth. Acute or subacute courses and
systemic evidence of infection may contribute to judge the clinical significance 
of positive cultures and avoid unnecessary antibiotic treatment. β-Lactam agents 
plus fluoroquinolones or vancomycin/teicoplanin or clindamycin may be appropriate
to achieve full coverage of the β-lactam resistant bacteria.
