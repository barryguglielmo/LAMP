A 24-year-old woman with a medical history of chronic lower extremity oedema,
abdominal pain, diarrhoea and recurrent pulmonary infections presented with
sepsis from right lower extremity cellulitis. Blood cultures grew Morganella
morganii Laboratory evaluation revealed lymphopaenia, hypogammaglobulinaemia, a
low CD4+ T-cell count and nutritional deficiencies resulting from protein-losing 
enteropathy (PLE). CT showed small bowel wall thickening in the jejunum and
ileum. Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia (PIL) was the likely diagnosis that
explained her PLE and immunodeficiencies. Video capsule endoscopy is an important
diagnostic tool for distal small bowel pathology and confirmed patchy areas of
lymphangiectasia of the jejunum and ileum. Secondary causes of lymphangiectasia
were ruled out. Clinically significant immunodeficiency from PIL has not been
frequently documented, and this case adds to the literature of rare infections
associated with PIL. Treatment with intravenous antibiotics resolved her
septicaemia, while dietary modifications improved her oedema, abdominal pain and 
diarrhoea.
