BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of supplementation 
with 109 spores of Bacillus coagulans (GBI-30) plus inulin in patients with
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, fifty 
three patients with NAFLD were randomly assigned to receive either a synbiotic or
a placebo capsule for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was reduction in steatosis
score in Fibroscan exam.
RESULTS: At the end of study, serum alanine aminotransferase and γ glutamine
transaminase decreased significantly more in synbiotic group compared to placebo 
group (p = 0.001, and p = 0.004, respectively). Synbiotic supplementation
significantly reduced serum tumor necrosis factor-α (p = 0.03) and nuclear
factor-κB activity (p = 0.04). Moreover, hepatic steatosis reduced significantly 
more in synbiotic group compared to placebo group (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that 12 weeks supplementation with B. coagulans 
plus inulin is beneficial for treatment of NAFLD and its related inflammation
without any significant effects on related cardiovascular risk factors.
