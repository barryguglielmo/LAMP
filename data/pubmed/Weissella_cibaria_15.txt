Five bacteriophages were isolated from kimchi with the hosts of two Weissella
cibaria and acid-producing bacteria, and characterized for understanding
Weissella phage. By transmission electron microscope, фWC51 and фWC52 belonged to
the Myoviridae and фWC005, фWC130, and фWC248 belonged to the Podoviridae.
One-step growth curves showed that latent periods of bacteriophages ranged from
70 to 90 min and burst sizes ranged from 7 to 195 particles/cell. фWC51 and
фWC005 were thermally resistant than the others and those D values were 71 and
34 s at 70 °C. pH stability test at pH 2.0-4.0 showed фWC005 was most stable and 
the others were also stable at low pH of 3.0. Interestingly, the phages showed
two types of morphology and had a high tolerance under acidic condition,
therefore, which might cause mortality to the Weissella after middle stage of
kimchi fermentation.
