Carbapenems are currently the preferred agents for the treatment of serious
Acinetobacter infections. However, whether cefepime-cefpirome can be used to
treat an Acinetobacter bloodstream infection (BSI) if it is active against the
causative pathogen(s) is not clear. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of
cefepime-cefpirome and carbapenem monotherapy in patients with Acinetobacter BSI.
The population included 360 patients with monomicrobial Acinetobacter BSI
receiving appropriate antimicrobial therapy admitted to four medical centers in
Taiwan in 2012 to 2017. The predictors of 30-day mortality were determined by Cox
regression analysis. The overall 30-day mortality rate in the appropriate
antibiotic treatment group was 25.0% (90/360 patients). The crude 30-day
mortality rates for cefepime-cefpirome and carbapenem therapy were 11.5% (7/61
patients) and 26.3% (21/80 patients), respectively. The patients receiving
cefepime-cefpirome or carbapenem therapy were infected by Acinetobacter
nosocomialis (51.8%), Acinetobacter baumannii (18.4%), and Acinetobacter pittii
(12.1%). After adjusting for age, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)
score, invasive procedures, and underlying diseases, cefepime-cefpirome therapy
was not independently associated with a higher or lower 30-day mortality rate
compared to that with the carbapenem therapy. SOFA score (hazard ratio [HR],
1.324; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.137 to 1.543; P < 0.001) and neutropenia
(HR, 7.060; 95% CI, 1.607 to 31.019; P = 0.010) were independent risk factors for
30-day mortality of patients receiving cefepime-cefpirome or carbapenem
monotherapy. The incidence densities of 30-day mortality for cefepime-cefpirome
versus carbapenem therapy were 0.40% versus 1.04%, respectively. The therapeutic 
response of cefepime-cefpirome therapy was comparable to that with carbapenems
among patients with Acinetobacter BSI receiving appropriate antimicrobial
therapy.
