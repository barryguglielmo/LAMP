As veterinarians, we may be the first to diagnose emerging zoonotic diseases in
ferrets and may be at increased risk of exposure. Pseudomonas luteola is a
bacterial infection that causes respiratory disease, panniculitis, sialadenitis, 
and abscess formation. Hepatitis E virus can cause subclinical infection, acute
hepatitis, and persistent infection. Since the 2013 article discussing the 2009
influenza pandemic affecting ferrets, there has been an additional case of
suspected anthroponotic infection in a pet ferret and experimental infection with
influenza viruses from humans, cats, and dogs.
