Here we describe a case of a 15-year-old child with Rett syndrome who presented
with extreme gastric distension and fatal perforation in the setting of
long-standing aerophagia and pathologic colonization with Sarcina ventriculi, a
rare bacteria implicated in gastric perforation. This is the first report of
gastric perforation associated with colonization by Sarcina in a patient with
pathologic aerophagia. Gastric colonization with Sarcina should be considered in 
intellectually disabled children with pathologic air swallowing who present with 
severe gastric dilation and/or perforation.
