Clostridium formicoaceticum, a Gram-negative mixotrophic homoacetogen, produces
acetic acid as the sole metabolic product from various carbon sources, including 
fructose, glycerol, formate, and CO2. Its genome of 4.59-Mbp contains a highly
conserved Wood-Ljungdahl pathway gene cluster with the same layout as that in
other mixotrophic acetogens, including Clostridium aceticum, Clostridium
carboxidivorans, and Clostridium ljungdahlii. For energy conservation, C.
formicoaceticum does not have all the genes required for the synthesis of
cytochrome or quinone used for generating proton gradient in H+-dependent
acetogens such as Moorella thermoacetica; instead, it has the Rnf system and a
Na+-translocating ATPase similar to the one in Acetobacterium woodii. Its growth 
in both heterotrophic and autotrophic media were dependent on the sodium
concentration. C. formicoaceticum has genes encoding acetaldehyde dehydrogenases,
alcohol dehydrogenases, and aldehyde oxidoreductases, which could convert
acetyl-CoA and acetate to ethanol and butyrate to butanol under excessive
reducing equivalent conditions.
