PURPOSE: This study aims to compare the marginal fitness of two types of
implant-supported fixed dental prosthesis, i.e., cementless fixation (CL.F)
system and cement-retained type.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In each group, ten specimens were assessed. Each specimen 
comprised implant lab analog, titanium abutment fabricated with a 2-degree
tapered axial wall, and zirconia crown. The crown of the CL.F system was retained
by frictional force between abutment and relined composite resin. In the
cement-retained type, zinc oxide eugenol cement was used to set crown and
abutment. All specimens were sterilized with ethylene oxide, immersed in
Prevotella intermedia culture in a 50 mL tube, and incubated with rotation. After
48 h, the specimens were washed thoroughly before separating the crown and
abutment. The bacteria that penetrated into the crown-abutment interface were
collected by washing with 500 µL of sterile saline. The bacterial cell number was
quantified using the agar plate count technique. The BacTiter-Glo Microbial Cell 
Viability Assay Kit was used to measure bacterial adenosine triphosphate
(ATP)-bioluminescence, which reflects the bacterial viability. The t-test was
performed, and the significance level was set at 5%.
RESULTS: The number of penetrating bacterial cells assessed by colony-forming
units was approximately 33% lower in the CL.F system than in the cement-retained 
type (P<.05). ATP-bioluminescence was approximately 41% lower in the CL.F system 
than in the cement-retained type (P<.05).
CONCLUSION: The CL.F system is more resistant to bacterial penetration into the
abutment-crown interface than the cement-retained type, thereby indicating a
precise marginal fit.
