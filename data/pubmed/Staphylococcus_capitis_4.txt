Aim: This study investigated the effect of an insect antimicrobial protein,
apolipophorin III (apoLp-III), against two newly isolated, identified and
characterized clinical strains of Staphylococcus spp. Materials & methods: Both
strains were identified by 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolic and phenotypic
profiling. The antibacterial activity of apoLp-III was tested using a colony
counting assay. ApoLp-III interaction with bacterial cell surface was analyzed by
Fourier transform IR spectroscopy. Results: Staphylococcus epidermidis and
Staphylococcus capitis were identified. ApoLp-III exerted a dose-dependent
bactericidal effect on the tested strains. The differences in the Staphylococcus 
spp. surface components may contribute to the various sensitivities of these
strains to apoLp-III. Conclusion: ApoLp-III may provide a baseline for
development of antibacterial preparations against Staphylococcus spp. involved in
dermatological problems.
