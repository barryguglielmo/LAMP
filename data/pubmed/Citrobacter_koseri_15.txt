Major depressive disorder (MDD) is accompanied by higher serum IgM/IgA responses 
to LPS of Gram-negative bacteria, suggesting increased bacterial translocation
and gut dysbiosis while the latter may occur in bipolar disorder (BD). There are 
differences between MDD and BD type 1 (BP1) and 2 (BP2) in nitro-oxidative stress
biomarkers associated with leaky gut. This study examines serum IgM/IgA responses
directed to LPS of 6 Gram-negative bacteria as well as IgG responses to oxidized 
LDL (oxLDL) in 29 BP1, 37 BP2, 44 MDD, and 30 healthy individuals. Increased
IgM/IgA responses to Pseudomonas aeruginosa significantly discriminated patients 
with affective disorders (MDD plus BD) from controls. BP1 patients showed higher 
IgM responses to Morganella morganii as compared with MDD and BP2 patients.
Patients with melancholia showed higher IgA responses to Citrobacter koseri as
compared to controls and non-melancholic depression. The total score on the
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale was significantly associated with IgA responses 
to C. koseri. IgG to oxLDL was significantly associated with increased bacterial 
translocation. In conclusion, MDD, BP1, and BP2 are accompanied by an immune
response due to the increased load of LPS while these aberrations in the
gut-brain axis are most pronounced in BP1 and melancholia. Activated oxidative
stress pathways and autoimmune responses to oxidative specific epitopes in mood
disorders may be driven by a breakdown in gut paracellular, transcellular, and/or
vascular pathways. If replicated, drugs that protect the integrity of the gut
barrier may offer novel therapeutic opportunities for BP1 and MDD.
