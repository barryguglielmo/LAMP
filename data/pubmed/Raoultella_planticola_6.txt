To characterize the florfenicol resistance gene and analyze the structure of the 
resistance gene-related sequence of an Raoultella planticola strain S25 isolated 
from a duck fecal sample from a farm in South China. Molecular cloning was
performed to clone the resistance genes such as mdfA, floR and so on, and the
minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were quantified to determine the
resistance levels generated by the cloned genes and the related strains.
Sequencing and comparative genomics methods were used to analyze the structure of
the resistance gene-related sequence. The result showed that the genome of R.
planticola S25 consists of a 5.47 Mb chromosome encoding 4962 predicted coding
sequence (CDS) and a 68,566 bp plasmid, pS25-68, encoding 84 ORFs. The plasmid
sharing the greatest sequence identity with the floR-carrying plasmid pS25-68 is 
plasmid1 in Klebsiella pneumoniae strain blaNDM-1, which was isolated from a
patient in Canada. The mdfA1 gene encoded on the chromosome generated resistance 
to florfenicol in addition to chloramphenicol. Comparative genomic analysis of
the floR-related transposon-like fragment of pS25-68 showed that an approximately
3 kb sequence encoding IS91-virD2-floR-lysR was conserved and presented in the
majority of the sequences (84.5 %, 169/200) collected from the database. The
results of this work demonstrated that horizontal transfer of the florfenicol
resistance gene floR occurred widely between the bacteria of different species
and with different origins and that additional florfenicol resistance genes may
be present in the bacterial population.
