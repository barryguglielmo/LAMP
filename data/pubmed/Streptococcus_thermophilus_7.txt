Here, we report the draft genome sequence of Streptococcus thermophilus strain
CBC-S77. The strain was originally isolated from naturally processed, homemade
dairy foods in West Rhode Mountain, Bulgaria. The genome was assembled in 148
contigs with a total length of 1,707,130 bp, with 1,563 coding genes and a GC
content of 39.11%.
