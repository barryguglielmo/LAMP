Progress in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has advanced from fundamental
chemistry to engineering processes and applications, resulting in new industrial 
opportunities. The unique features of MOFs, such as their permanent porosity,
high surface area, and structural flexibility, continue to draw industrial
interest outside the traditional MOF field, both to solve existing challenges and
to create new businesses. In this context, diverse research has been directed
toward commercializing MOFs, but such studies have been performed according to a 
variety of individual goals. Therefore, there have been limited opportunities to 
share the challenges, goals, and findings with most of the MOF field. In this
review, we examine the issues and demands for MOF commercialization and
investigate recent advances in MOF process engineering and applications.
Specifically, we discuss the criteria for MOF commercialization from the views of
stability, producibility, regulations, and production cost. This review covers
progress in the mass production and formation of MOFs along with future
applications that are not currently well known but have high potential for new
areas of MOF commercialization.
