Acinetobacter junii is one of more than 50 different species belonging to the
genus Acinetobacter. This bacterium is rarely reported to cause human infections.
Here we described a rare case of Acinetobacter junii, which grew in urine culture
approximately one month after the patient was discharged from the hospital with
antibiotics for a urinary tract infection, which caused left obstructing renal
calculi requiring nephrostomy tube placement.
