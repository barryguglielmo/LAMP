This study reports the complete genome sequences of four strains of Streptococcus
canis isolated from dogs in South Korea. Their genomes ranged from 2.157 to 2.265
Mbp, with a G+C content of 39.6% to 39.7%. The sequence types, antimicrobial
resistance genes, and S. canis M-like protein alleles were characterized.
