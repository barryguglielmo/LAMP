AIMS: The object of this study was to identify potential health concerns of the
Aeromons spp. isolated from marketed Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai)
with respect to their virulence and antimicrobial resistance patterns.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified 29 strains of aeromonads consisting of five
species; Aeromonas hydrophila (n = 9), Aeromonas enteropelogenes (n = 14),
Aeromonas veronii (n = 3), Aeromonas salmonicida (n = 2) and Aeromonas sobria
(n = 1), by employing series of biochemical tests and gene sequencing. In the
phenotypic virulence assays, all isolates showed gelatinase and caseinase
activities, while lipase formation (69%), phospholipase production (90%), DNase
formation (82%), slime production (49%) and haemolysis activity (α = 18% and
β = 82%) were also detected among isolates. Prevalence of virulence genes; aerA
(100%), fla (66%), ahyB (73%), act (52%), alt (42%), ast (35%), ser (52%), gcat
(69%), ascV (43%), hlyA (83%), lip (52%) and exu (59%) were detected by PCR
assays. In disc diffusion test, 100% resistance was detected against ampicillin
while cephalothin, rifampicin, oxytetracycline, colistine sulphate, nalidixic
acid and piperaciliin were resisted by 86, 73, 42, 35, 28, 20 and 20% of the
isolates respectively. Thirteen (45%) of the isolates showed multiple
antimicrobial resistance (MAR) indices ≥ 0·2.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the potential health risk posed by the
abalone-borne Aeromonas spp. should not be underestimated.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first time to evaluate possible
public health risks upon consumption of abalone harbored Aeromonas spp. and also 
to isolate potential pathogenic and multidrug-resistant Aeromonas spp. from
Pacific abalone in Korea.
