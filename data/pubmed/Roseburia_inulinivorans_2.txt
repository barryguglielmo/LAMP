Roseburia species are important denizens of the human gut microbiome that ferment
complex polysaccharides to butyrate as a terminal fermentation product, which
influences human physiology and serves as an energy source for colonocytes.
Previous comparative genomics analyses of the genus Roseburia have examined
polysaccharide degradation genes. Here, we characterize the core and pangenomes
of the genus Roseburia with respect to central carbon and energy metabolism, as
well as biosynthesis of amino acids and B vitamins using orthology-based methods,
uncovering significant differences among species in their biosynthetic
capacities. Variation in gene content among Roseburia species and strains was
most significant for cofactor biosynthesis. Unlike all other species of Roseburia
that we analysed, Roseburia inulinivorans strains lacked biosynthetic genes for
riboflavin or pantothenate but possessed folate biosynthesis genes. Differences
in gene content for B vitamin synthesis were matched with differences in putative
salvage and synthesis strategies among species. For example, we observed extended
biotin salvage capabilities in R. intestinalis strains, which further suggest
that B vitamin acquisition strategies may impact fitness in the gut ecosystem. As
differences in the functional potential to synthesize components of biomass (e.g.
amino acids, vitamins) can drive interspecies interactions, variation in
auxotrophies of the Roseburia spp. genomes may influence in vivo gut ecology.
This study serves to advance our understanding of the potential metabolic
interactions that influence the ecology of Roseburia spp. and, ultimately, may
provide a basis for rational strategies to manipulate the abundances of these
species.
