OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the microbiota profile of residual alveolar slits and
teeth adjacent to the cleft in fissured individuals.
DESIGNS: This study used a cross-sectional design.
PARTICIPANTS: Twenty individuals, aged 14 to 24 years, who had a residual fissure
in the maxillary alveolar ridge region were selected.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Three sites per individual were selected for
microbiological collection (the site of the residual cleft and the 2 nearest
teeth). The samples were analyzed using the Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization
technique for 73 species of bacteria.
RESULTS: All the species analyzed were found in the 2 niches (slits and teeth).
The bacterial species present in the largest number in the residual cracks were
Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella nigrescens, and Streptococcus mitis. With
regard to the bacterial profiles in the mesial and distal faces, the most
prevalent species were P nigrescens, Veillonella parvula, and Fusobacterium
nucleatum sp vicentii. The analysis of all the collected samples demonstrated
very similar profiles for the mesial and distal faces, with these 2 sites even
presenting the same species in greater frequencies. Higher counts of 20 bacterial
species (Wilcoxon test) were observed in the dental niche, in relation to the
fissure, particularly, P nigrescens, V parvula, F nucleatum sp vicentii, and
Neisseria mucosa.
CONCLUSION: Some species were significantly more prevalent in the residual
alveolar fissures and in adjacent teeth. The comparison between the profiles of
the 2 niches demonstrated large differences in the most frequent species in the
teeth, and no qualitative differences with regard to specific pathogens.
