This work investigated the properties of Paracoccus yeei VKM B-3302 bacteria
isolated from activated sludge and immobilized in an N-vinylpyrrolidone-modified 
poly(vinyl alcohol) matrix. The developed hydrogel formed a network structure to 
enable the entrapment of microbial cells with their viability and biocatalytic
properties preserved, which ensured the technological possibility of replicating 
expendable biosensor receptor elements. A new ratio of the components for the
synthesis selected in this work enabled producing a copolymer of an earlier
undescribed chemical structure, which can be efficiently used for immobilization 
of highly sensitive P. yeei bacteria. A biological oxygen demand (BOD) biosensor 
with these bacteria and matrix was shown to possess a long-time stability
exceeding that described earlier, to have a broad substrate specificity and to
exceed approximately tenfold the nearest analogues by its sensitivity and the
lower boundary value of 0.05 mg/dm3. The biosensor enabled assays of water
samples initially attributed to pure samples (the BOD range, 0.05-5.0 mg/dm3).
BOD assays of water samples from various sources showed the use of the receptor
element of this composition to enable the data that closely correlated with the
standard method (R 2 = 0.9990).
