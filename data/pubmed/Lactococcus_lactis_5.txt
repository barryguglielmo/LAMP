Antibacterial peptides or bacteriocins produced by many strains of lactic acid
bacteria have been used as food preservatives for many years without any known
adverse effects. Bacteriocin titres can be modified by altering the physiological
and nutritional factors of the producing bacterium to improve the production in
terms of yield and productivity. The effects of culture conditions (initial pH,
inoculum age and inoculum size) and medium compositions (organic and inorganic
nitrogen sources; carbon sources) were assessed for the production of
bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (BLIS) by Lactococcus lactis Gh1 in shake 
flask cultures. An inoculum of the mid-exponential phase culture at 1% (v/v) was 
the optimal age and size, while initial pH of culture media at alkaline and
acidic state did not show a significant impact on BLIS secretion. Organic
nitrogen sources were more favourable for BLIS production compared to inorganic
sources. Production of BLIS by L. lactis Gh1 in soytone was 1.28-times higher as 
compared to that of organic nitrogen sources ((NH4)2SO4). The highest cell
concentration (XmX = 0.69 ± 0.026 g·L-1) and specific growth rate (μmax = 0.14
h-1) were also observed in cultivation using soytone. By replacing carbon sources
with fructose, BLIS production was increased up to 34.94% compared to BHI medium,
which gave the biomass cell concentration and specific growth rate of 0.66 ±
0.002 g·L-1 and 0.11 h-1, respectively. It can be concluded that the fermentation
factors have pronounced influences on the growth of L. lactis Gh1 and BLIS
production. Results from this study could be used for subsequent application in
process design and optimisation for improving BLIS production by L. lactis Gh1 at
larger scale.
