Purulent pericardial effusion is a rare and life-threatening complication of
pyogenic liver abscess if not diagnosed and intervened early. Due to its
nonspecific presentation, diagnosis of pyogenic liver abscess is challenging.
Herein, we discuss the case of a 31-year-old healthy male that presented with
acute chest tightness for one day in the setting of spontaneous rupture of
pyogenic liver abscess and developed transdiaphragmatic extension of purulent
pericardial effusion. The abscess resolved with antibiotic therapy (beta-lactam),
ultrasound-guided aspiration, and pericardial window. Culture of pericardial
fluid yielded the Streptococcus anginosus group. He was subsequently discharged
following clinical resolution and normalization of liver function tests after
15 days of treatment. Follow-up ultrasonography revealed that the liver abscess
and pericardial effusion were resolved in 8 weeks post treatment and
intervention.
