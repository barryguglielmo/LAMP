The aim of this study was to evaluate thermosonication as an alternative method
for the pasteurization of pulque in order to improve its shelf life and retain
its quality parameters. Thermosonication was carried out at 50 °C using
amplitudes of 75% (for 6 and for 9 min), 85% (for 4 and for 6 min), and 95% (for 
3 and for 5 min). These were the optimal conditions found for processing pulque
by thermosonication. Physicochemical (acidity, color, alcohol content, and
sensory analysis) and microbiological (lactic acid bacteria and yeasts)
parameters were determined during 30 days for storage at 4 ± 1 °C. Conventional
pasteurization (63 °C, 30 min) and raw pulque were used as controls. According to
the results, the shelf life of pulque was extended up to 24 days storage at 4 °C.
After this time, the quality of beverage decreased, due that the microbial load
increases. Thermosonication treatments at 75% and 85% showed a higher content of 
LAB (6.58-6.77 log CFU/mL) and yeasts (7.08-7.27 log CFU/mL) than conventional
pasteurization (3.64 log CFU/mL of LAB and 3.97 log CFU/mL of yeasts) at 24 days 
of storage. Raw pulque demonstrated up to 7.77 log CFU/mL of yeasts and 7.51 log 
CFU/mL of LAB. Pulque processed by thermosonication exhibited greater lightness, 
sensory acceptance, a maximal acidity of 0.83 g/lactic acid, and an alcohol
content of 4.48-4.95% v/v. The thermosonication process preserves sensory and
physicochemical properties better than conventional pasteurization. Lactic acid
bacteria such as Lactobacillus kefiri, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and
Lactobacillus hilgardii and yeasts such as Saccharomyces cereviasiae were
identified in thermosonicated pulque.
