A bioactive polysaccharide from microalga Chlorella pyrenoidosa (CPP) was
successively prepared via DEAE-52 and G-100 columns. Nuclear magnetic resonance
analysis showed that the main glycosidic bonds were composed of
1,2-linked-α-l-Fucp, 1,4-linked-α-l-Rhap, 1,4-linked-β-l-Araf, 1-linked-α-d-Glcp,
1,3-linked-β-d-GlcpA, 1,4-linked-β-d-Xylp, and 1,3,6-linked-β-d-Manp. Its
molecular weight was 5.63 × 106 Da. The hypolipidemic effect and intestinal flora
regulation of CPP on diet-induced rats were evaluated through histopathology and 
biochemistry analyses. CPP could improve plasma and liver lipid metabolism and
accelerate the metabolism of the cecal total bile acids and short-chain fatty
acids. CPP has also upregulated the adenosine-monophosphate-activated protein
kinase α and downregulated the acetyl-CoA carboxylase, sterol regulatory
element-binding protein 1c, and β-hydroxy β-methylglutaryl-CoA expressions.
Moreover, with the 16S rRNA gene sequencing, it was revealed that the composition
of intestinal flora changed drastically after treatment, such as the bloom of
Coprococcus_1, Lactobacillus, and Turicibacter, whereas there was a strong
reduction of the [Ruminococcus]_gauvreauii_group. The above results illustrated
that CPP might be served as an effective ingredient to ameliorate lipid
metabolism disorders and intestinal flora in hyperlipidemia rats.
