Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent for anthrax, is a dangerous pathogen to
humans and has a history as a bioterrorism agent. While sampling methods have
been developed and evaluated for characterizing and clearing contaminated indoor 
sites, the performance of these sampling methods is unknown for use in outdoor
environments. This paper presents surface sampling data for Bacillus atrophaeus
spores, a surrogate for B. anthracis, from a 210-day outdoor study that evaluated
the detection and recovery of spores using five different sampling methods as
follows: sponge sticks, 37-mm vacuum filter cassettes, residential wet vacuums,
robotic floor cleaners, and grab samples of soil, leaves, and grass. The spores
were applied by spraying a liquid suspension onto the surfaces. Both asphalt and 
concrete surfaces were sampled by all the surface sampling methods, excluding
grab sampling. Stainless steel coupons placed outdoors were additionally sampled 
using sponge sticks. Sampling methods differed in their ability to collect
detectable spores over the duration of the study. The 37-mm vacuums and sponge
sticks consistently detected spores on asphalt through day 37 and robots through 
day 99. The wet vacuums detected spores on asphalt for days 1 and 4, but not
again until day 210. On concrete, all samplers detected spores until day 210
except for sponge stick samplers that detected spores only up until the day 99
time point. For all sampling methods, spore recoveries were higher from concrete 
than from asphalt surfaces. There was no statistically significant difference in 
recoveries of sponge sticks and 37-mm vacuums from either asphalt or concrete
surfaces. Processing of grab samples was challenging due to non-target background
microorganisms resulting in high detection limits for the samples.
