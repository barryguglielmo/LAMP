The cumulative risk score (CRS) is a mathematical salivary diagnostic model to
define an individual's risk of having periodontitis. In order to further validate
this salivary biomarker, we investigated how periodontal bacteria,
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and systemic and local host immune responses relate to 
CRS. Subgingival plaque, saliva, and serum samples collected from 445 individuals
were used in the analyses. Plaque levels of 28 microbial species, especially
those of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis,
Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Tannerella forsythia, and 
serum and salivary levels of IgA and IgG against these five species were
determined. Additionally, LPS activity was measured. High CRS associated strongly
with all IgA/IgG antibody and LPS levels in saliva, whereas in serum the
associations were not that obvious. In the final logistic regression model, the
best predictors of high CRS were saliva IgA burden against the five species (OR
7.04, 95% CI 2.25-22.0), IgG burden (3.79, 1.78-8.08), LPS (2.19, 1.38-3.47), and
the sum of 17 subgingival Gram-negative species (6.19, 2.10-18.3). CRS is
strongly associated with microbial biomarker species of periodontitis and
salivary humoral immune responses against them.
