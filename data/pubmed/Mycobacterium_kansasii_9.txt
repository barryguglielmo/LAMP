Background: Non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infections are growing concern in
many countries around the globe including Iran. Among them, Mycobacterium
kansasii (M. kansasii) causes both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary infections.
Despite the high prevalence of M. kansasii isolates in Iran, unfortunately little
is known about the epidemiological aspects of M. kansasii infection. Hence, the
aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular identification,
determination of subtypes variation and geographic distribution of clinical
isolates of M. kansasii isolates.
Methods: In the present study, 108 clinical pulmonary isolates suspected to NTM
were collected from four Tuberculosis Regional Reference Laboratories in Iran
during 2016-2018. The isolates were confirmed as NTM using conventional and
molecular methods. Among them, M. kansasii isolates were subjected to rpoB gene
sequencing. For determination of subtyping of M. kansasii isolates, polymerase
chain reaction-restriction enzyme analysis (PCR-REA) based on the hsp65 gene was 
performed.
Results: Based on the rpoB gene sequence analysis, 33 (30.5%) isolates were
identified as M. kansasii species, compared to 31 (28.7%) isolates using
phenotypic methods. The subtype I was the most frequent subtype (n=24; 72.7%),
followed by subtype II (n=8; 24.2%).
Conclusion: We indicated that the rate of M. kansasii isolation with clinical
significance appears to be increasing in Iran, especially in highly
industrialized cities. The high rate of M. kansasii subtype I may suggest that
this genotype has a particular potency for colonization, and a higher
epidemiological potential for causing infection in humans. More studies are
needed to provide a better understanding of the biology and pathogenicity of M.
kansasii subtype I.
