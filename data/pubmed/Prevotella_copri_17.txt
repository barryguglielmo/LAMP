In mice, the maternal microbiome influences fetal immune development and
postnatal allergic outcomes. Westernized populations have high rates of allergic 
disease and low rates of gastrointestinal carriage of Prevotella, a commensal
bacterial genus that produces short chain fatty acids and endotoxins, each of
which may promote the development of fetal immune tolerance. In this study, we
use a prebirth cohort (n = 1064 mothers) to conduct a nested case-cohort study
comparing 58 mothers of babies with clinically proven food IgE mediated food
allergy with 258 randomly selected mothers. Analysis of the V4 region of the 16S 
rRNA gene in fecal samples shows maternal carriage of Prevotella copri during
pregnancy strongly predicts the absence of food allergy in the offspring. This
association was confirmed using targeted qPCR and was independent of infant
carriage of P. copri. Larger household size, which is a well-established
protective factor for allergic disease, strongly predicts maternal carriage of P.
copri.
