Introduction: Biofilms protect bacteria from antibiotics and this can produce
drug-resistant strains, especially the main pathogen of periodontitis,
Porphyromonas gingivalis. Carbon quantum dots with various biomedical properties 
are considered to have great application potential in antibacterial and
anti-biofilm treatment.
Methods: Tinidazole carbon quantum dots (TCDs) and metronidazole carbon quantum
dots (MCDs) were prepared by a hydrothermal method with the clinical
antibacterial drugs tinidazole and metronidazole, respectively. Then, TCDs and
MCDs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, UV-visible
spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy and energy-dispersive spectrometry. The
antibacterial effects were also investigated under different conditions.
Results: The TCDs and MCDs had uniform sizes. The results of UV-visible and
energy-dispersive spectrometry confirmed their important carbon polymerization
structures and the activity of the nitro group, which had an evident inhibitory
effect on P. gingivalis, but almost no effect on other bacteria, including
Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Prevotella nigrescens. Importantly,
the TCDs could penetrate the biofilms to further effectively inhibit the growth
of P. gingivalis under the biofilms. Furthermore, it was found that the
antibacterial effect of TCDs lies in its ability to impair toxicity by inhibiting
the major virulence factors and related genes involved in the biofilm formation
of P. gingivalis, thus affecting the self-assembly of biofilm-related proteins.
Conclusion: The findings demonstrate a promising new method for improving the
efficiency of periodontitis treatment by penetrating the P. gingivalis biofilm
with preparations of nano-level antibacterial drugs.
