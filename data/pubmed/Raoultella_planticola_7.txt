Recurrent urinary tract infections are difficult to manage in patients with a
history of kidney transplant and may contribute to graft loss. Few cases describe
recurrent urinary tract infections due to Raoultella planticola in this
population. We describe the management of recurrent urinary tract infections due 
to R planticola in a kidney transplant recipient and review other case reports of
urinary tract infections due to this organism.
