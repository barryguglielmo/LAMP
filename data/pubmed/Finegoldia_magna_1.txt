Emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN) is a necrotizing gas producing infection of
the renal parenchyma that commonly occurs in patients with diabetes. EPN requires
early diagnosis and treatment due to the possible life-threatening septic
complications. We report a rare case of EPN caused by an unfavorable mixed
infection of Candida parapsilosis and Finegoldia magna. To our knowledge, this is
the first reported case of EPN caused by Finegoldia magna. A 62-year-old male
with diabetes mellitus (DM) presented with abdominal pain, shortness of breath,
and nausea in which a diagnosis of septic shock was made due to EPN. Our patient 
first noticed abdominal pain 3 weeks prior to hospital presentation; however, he 
avoided getting treatment due to a fear of contracting severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This patient exhibited deterioration and
expired after surgical intervention despite uneventful nephrectomy. This case
suggests that medical care avoidance behaviors among patients could potentially
complicate their clinical course.
