Ultraviolet (UV) exposure triggers the abnormal production of reactive oxygen
(ROS) species and the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that are
responsible for photoaging. Probiotics are widely used in healthcare and for
immune enhancement. One probiotic, Lactobacillus buchneri is found in Kimchi.
This study was aimed at assessing the anti-photoaging effect of plant extracts
fermented with L. buchneri (PELB) to develop functional cosmetics. We
investigated the anti-photoaging effect of PELB in a UVB-induced photoaging in
vitro model and selected effective extracts using the elastase inhibition assay, 
ELISA for Type I procollagen and collagenase-1, and quantitative real time PCR.
Normal human dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes were pre-treated with
PELB and exposed to UVB. We found that PELB decreased elastase activity and
increased type I collagen expression in a UVB-induced photoaging in vitro model. 
In addition, PELB greatly reduced collagenase activity and MMP mRNA levels in a
UVB-induced photoaging in vitro model. Furthermore, PELB promoted the expression 
of moisture factor and anti-oxidant enzymes in a UVB-induced photoaging in vitro 
model. These results indicated that the PELB could be potential candidates for
the protective effects against UVB-induced photoaging. Overall, these results
suggest that PELB might be useful natural components of cosmetic products.
