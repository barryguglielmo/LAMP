BACKGROUND: Facial cysts can become large (1-5 cm) or giant (>5 cm) on the face.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the medical course of large and giant facial cysts in
adolescents.
METHODS: A case series of 11 patients with large or giant facial cysts seen in an
outpatient pediatric dermatology practice.
RESULTS: Seven patients underwent incision and drainage with culture of cyst
contents growing Cutibacterium acnes in six, while the seventh grew Cutibacterium
acnes from a frequently worn hat. All patients were treated with traditional
therapeutics for cystic acne including intralesional triamcinolone (n = 9), oral 
antibiotics (n = 10), and isotretinoin (n = 1). Three patients who did not
undergo cyst drainage had persistent symptomatology requiring cyst excision,
whereas the seven patients whose cysts were drained (3 on initial management and 
4 after recurrence) eventually had complete healing without need for surgery.
CONCLUSION: Incision and drainage (I & D) and culture of cyst contents can
identify cases of cysts related to Cutibacterium acnes. For some cases of large
facial cysts related to Cutibacterium acne, I&D combined with conservative acne
management (using standard acne guidelines) can prevent the need for surgical
excision in some patients. Prospective studies are needed to determine whether
this combination of therapy leads to best outcomes clinically and cosmetically.
