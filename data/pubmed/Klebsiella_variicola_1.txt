The purpose of this study is to enhance the biodegradability of atrazine with
FH-1 and NJ-1 alone by selecting the mixing ratio, optimizing the culture medium 
and conditions. The results showed that FH-1 and NJ-1 have the best
biodegradation effect on atrazine being mixed in a volume ratio of 3:2. In a
single factor experiment, sucrose and NH4Cl provided carbon and nitrogen sources 
for the mixed bacteria. Subsequently, composition of fermentation medium was
further optimized using Box-Behnken design of response surface methodology. Based
on the results, growth of mixed bacteria and biodegradation of atrazine performed
best effects with a biodegradation rate of 85.6% when sucrose and NH4Cl amounts
were 35.30 g/L and 10.28 g/L. The optimal medium condition was 10% inoculum of
mixed bacteria, with initial atrazine concentration of 50 mg/L, neutral or weakly
alkaline pH value, 30°C. The biodegradation rate reached 97.4%, 11.8% higher than
the unoptimized condition.
