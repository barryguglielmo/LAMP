BACKGROUND: The soybean cyst nematode Heterodera glycines (Ichinohe) is the most 
devastating pathogen affecting soybean production worldwide. Biocontrol agents
have become eco-friendly candidates to control pathogens. The aim of this study
was to discover novel biocontrol agents against H. glycines.
RESULTS: Microbacterium maritypicum Sneb159, screened from 804 strains,
effectively reduced the number of females in field experiments conducted in 2014 
and 2015. The stability and efficiency of H. glycines control by Sneb159 was
further assessed in growth chamber and field experiments. Sneb159 decreased H.
glycines population densities, especially the number of females by 43.9%-67.7%.
To confirm Sneb159 induced plant resistance, a split-root assay was conducted.
Sneb159 induced local and systemic resistance to suppress the penetration and
development of H. glycines, and enhanced the gene expression of PR2, PR3b, and
JAZ1, involved in the salicylic acid and jasmonic acid pathways.
CONCLUSION: This is the first report of M. maritypicum Sneb159 suppressing H.
glycines infection. This effect may be the result of Sneb159-induced resistance. 
Our study indicates that M. maritypicum Sneb159 is a promising biocontrol agent
against H. glycines. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.
