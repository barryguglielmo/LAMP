Background: Microbial plaque-induced oral diseases are among the most common
diseases worldwide. The present study aimed to compare the antimicrobial effect
of electrolyzed water (EW), (acidic, mildly basic, and basic) on the growth of
bacterial species producing dental plaque and to assess their cytotoxicity on
fibroblasts and epithelial cells.
Methods: The study was performed at Shahid Beheshti University of Medical
Sciences in 2019. Several bacterial species (Streptococcus salivarius,
Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus casei, and Aggregatibacter
actinomycetemcomitans) were treated with different EW types at three pH values
(3, 9, and 11) for 30 seconds and subsequently, the colonies were counted. The
cytotoxic effect of these EW types was evaluated on HeLa and L929 cell lines at
30 seconds, 1 minute, and 5 minutes. GraphPad Prism 6.0 was used for statistical 
analysis. The Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Mann-Whitney U and one-way analysis
of variance followed by Tukey's test were used to analyze bacterial activity and 
cell cytotoxicity, respectively. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results: EW types significantly inhibited bacterial growth at all pH values. The 
strongest antibacterial activity of EW was against A. actinomycetemcomitans
(P<0.001) and the least significant antibacterial activity was against S. aureus 
(P<0.001). The EW types showed increased cytotoxic activity against L929 cells as
the treatment time increased. The most cytotoxic effect was seen at 5 minutes of 
treatment in all EW types compared with the negative control group (P<0.0001).
This negative cytotoxic effect on HeLa cells was shown just after 30 seconds and 
viable cell counts increased over time, reaching its highest value at 5 minutes
of treatment with basic EW (P<0.0001).
Conclusion: The contradictory effects of the EW types on both HeLa and
fibroblasts, in addition to variable results at different exposure times,
indicated that the effect of EW could vary depending on cell types and treatment 
periods.
