The occurrence of multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria, such as
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), multidrug-resistant
Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB), extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase (ESBL) Escherichia
coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, has become a serious problem in animals and
public. The objective of this study was to identify and isolate lactic acid
bacterial (LAB) strains from the intestinal tracts of pigs and feces of dogs and 
then characterize them as potential probiotics with antimicrobial activity
against multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria. In a preliminary isolation
screening, 45 of 1167 isolated LAB strains were found to have anti-S. aureus ATCC
27,735 activity. Using 16S rDNA and 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region (ISR)
sequences, five of these isolates were further identified as Lactobacillus
animalis 30a-2, Lactobacillus reuteri 4-12E, Weissella cibaria C34, Lactococcus
lactis 5-12H, and Lactococcus lactis 6-3H. Antimicrobial substance assays suggest
that the L. lactis 5-12H, L. lactis 6-3H, L. animalis 30a-2, L. reuteri 4-12E,
and W. cibaria C34 strains might produce bacteriocins and hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2) as antimicrobial substances. The L. animalis 30a-2 and W. cibaria C34
strains were further characterized for probiotic properties and shown to have
high acid and bile salt tolerance. Additionally, they have broad antimicrobial
spectra, and can significantly repress the growth of all of the tested strains of
MRSA isolates, some MDRAB, ESBL E. coli, and P. aeruginosa isolates, along with
food-borne pathogenic bacteria such as Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Listeria
monocytogens ATCC 19111, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., and Yersinia
enterocolitica BCRC 12986. This is the first report of H2O2-producing L. animalis
30a-2 and W. cibaria C34 isolated from the intestinal tracts of pigs and feces of
dogs that have good antimicrobial activity against multidrug-resistant and
food-borne pathogenic bacteria and have excellent probiotic properties.
