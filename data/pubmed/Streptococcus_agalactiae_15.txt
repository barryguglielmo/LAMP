Treatment of bacterial infections is a great challenge of our era due to the
various resistance mechanisms against antibiotics. Antimicrobial peptides are
considered to be potential novel compound as antibiotic treatment. However, some 
bacteria, especially many human pathogens, are inherently resistant to these
compounds, due to the expression of BceAB-type ABC transporters. This rather new 
transporter family is not very well studied. Here, we report the first full
characterization of the nucleotide binding domain of a BceAB type transporter
from Streptococcus agalactiae, namely SaNsrF of the transporter SaNsrFP, which
confers resistance against nisin and gallidermin. We determined the NTP
hydrolysis kinetics and used molecular modeling and simulations in combination
with small angle X-ray scattering to obtain structural models of the SaNsrF
monomer and dimer. The fact that the SaNsrFH202A variant displayed no ATPase
activity was rationalized in terms of changes of the structural dynamics of the
dimeric interface. Kinetic data show a clear preference for ATP as a substrate,
and the prediction of binding modes allowed us to explain this selectivity over
other NTPs.
