Streptococcus mitis (S. mitis) is a commensal bacterial species that commonly
colonizes the oropharynx and gastrointestinal tract. It is seldom reported as a
human pathogen. However, immunocompromised individuals may be at risk of
infection. We describe a 62-year-old male with prostate cancer who presented with
multiple S. mitis abscesses masquerading as metastases. In addition, we discuss
the differential diagnosis and treatment options for this rare opportunistic
infection.
