RATIONALE: Septic shock leads to multiple organ failure and increases mortality
rate. We reported a critical patient with abdominal septic shock, which was the
first case successfully treated with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) 
and a newly designed endotoxin removal device oXiris in mainland China.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 51-year-old man developed gastric ulcer perforation after
resection of a benign peritoneal tumor and had a second abdominal surgery. His
blood pressure decreased to 70/40 mm Hg with oliguria, requiring large doses of
noradrenaline and intravenous fluid for resuscitation. The abdominal cavity was
not sutured after the second open surgery due to severe abdominal infection and
distention. His leukocyte count was over 30109/L, while the blood lactic acid was
12.5 mmol/L and procalcitonin (PCT) was >100 ng/mL.
DIAGNOSIS: Since the bacterial culture of peritoneal exudate showed positive with
Enterobacter aerogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa after the second surgery, and
the patient had severe low blood pressure, hyoxemia and oliguria, combined with
the laboratory tests results, he was diagnosed with Gram-negative related septic 
shock, acute kidney injury, and multiple organ dysfunction.
INTERVENTIONS: CRRT with oXiris membrane was performed for 80hours and followed
by AN69 ST membranes during the subsequent 27 days. Antibiotics together with
other medical treatment were applied to the patient in the meantime.
OUTCOMES: At the end of 80 hours treatment with oXiris, PCT of the patient had
decreased to 14.52 ng/mL and lactic acid decreased to 4.2 mmol/L. The total
sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score decreased from 15 to 11. Urine
output steadily increased to 250 mL/h, and vital signs and blood pressure were
stable without noradrenaline. At the end of the 27 days of conventional CRRT, his
kidney function had completely recovered with a total sequential organ failure
assessment score (SOFA score) of 6.
LESSONS: oXiris, with its enhanced endotoxin adsorption, appeared to accelerate
improvement in organ dysfunction and ultimate survival in our patient. In
critical patients with abdominal septic shock, oXiris is an important adjunctive 
consideration to supplement definitive source control and antimicrobial therapy.
