The draft genome sequence of the blood-origin Streptococcus canis strain FU149,
isolated from a dog with a necrotizing soft tissue infection in Japan, is
reported. The genome size was 2.108 Mbp, with a G+C content of 39.5%. Sequences
unmapped to the reference genome sequence of NCTC 12191T (GenBank accession
number LR134293) were characterized.
