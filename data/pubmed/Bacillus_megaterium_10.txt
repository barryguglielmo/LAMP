The present study aimed to scrutinize the effect of different cow dung bacterial 
treatments on the nutritional value of Capsicum annuum L. Among all treatments,
seeds inoculated with Bacillus megaterium (CDK25) showed significant enhancement 
in various proximate constituents viz., crude fiber (3.31%), crude protein
(3.84%), and ash (2.53%) as compared to control. Likewise, significant increase
in different nutrient contents viz., Ca (16.26 mg/100 g), Mg (17.37 mg/100 g), P 
(11.91 mg/100 g), K (0.47 mg/100 g), Fe (1.37 mg/100 g), and Zn (0.21 mg/100 g)
was recorded over the control. Principal component analysis data depicts a
positive correlation between different treatments with variables, validating
enhancement in nutritional constituents by B. megaterium (CDK25) treatment. The
study suggests the application of "B. megaterium" for achieving the persistent
potential for augmenting and boosting up plant biological, functional, and
nutritional assets, thereby enhancing the overall edible quality of C. annuum L. 
along with weathering of soil minerals.
