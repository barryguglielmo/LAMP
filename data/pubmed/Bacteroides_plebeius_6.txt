Feline chronic enteropathy (CE) is a common gastrointestinal disorder in cats and
mainly comprises inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and small cell lymphoma (SCL). 
Both IBD and SCL in cats share features with chronic enteropathies such as IBD
and monomorphic epitheliotropic intestinal T-cell lymphoma in humans. The aim of 
this study was to characterize the fecal microbiome of 38 healthy cats and 27
cats with CE (13 cats with IBD and 14 cats with SCL). Alpha diversity indices
were significantly decreased in cats with CE (OTU p = 0.003, Shannon Index
p = 0.008, Phylogenetic Diversity p = 0.019). ANOSIM showed a significant
difference in bacterial communities, albeit with a small effect size (P = 0.023, 
R = 0.073). Univariate analysis and LEfSE showed a lower abundance of facultative
anaerobic taxa of the phyla Firmicutes (families Ruminococcaceae and
Turicibacteraceae), Actinobacteria (genus Bifidobacterium) and Bacteroidetes
(i.a. Bacteroides plebeius) in cats with CE. The facultative anaerobic taxa
Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcaceae were increased in cats with CE. No
significant difference between the microbiome of cats with IBD and those with SCL
was found. Cats with CE showed patterns of dysbiosis similar to those in found
people with IBD.
