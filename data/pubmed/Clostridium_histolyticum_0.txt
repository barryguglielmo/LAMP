BACKGROUND: Irradiation therapy limits the utilization of silicone implants for
breast reconstruction due to a significant risk for capsular contracture. The
injection of the collagenase of the bacterium Clostridium histolyticum (CCH)
might trivialize this risk by providing a minimal-invasive treatment option by
capsular contracture degradation. However, efficacy in degrading breast implant
capsules induced by fractionated irradiation remains unclear.
METHODS: Twenty-four rats in three groups received miniature silicone implants in
a submuscular pocket. After 3D dose calculation and treatment field definition,
rats of two groups underwent fractionated radiotherapy (6 × 8 Gy) using a linear 
accelerator. A third group served as control. On day 120, one irradiated group
received injections of 0.3 mg/ml collagenase. Administration of plain solvent
solution served as control in the two other groups. Outcome parameters included
CT-imaging, histology, vessel wall analysis, immunohistochemistry, chemical
collagen quantification and gene expression analysis.
RESULTS: Fractioned irradiation leads to a significant increase in collagen
deposition around silicone implants with higher capsule thickness and collagen
density when comparing all groups. Additionally, significant alterations of
collagen fiber deposition were evident. Vessel wall thickness was significantly
increased after radiotherapy. The injection of collagenase led to a significant
reduction of capsule thickness, collagen density and content. However, the
collagenase application induced a significant overexpression of TGFβ1. No side
effects were monitored.
CONCLUSIONS: The CCH proved to be a safe and effective approach to degrade
capsule tissue induced by fractionated irradiation in an animal model. This may
pave its way for clinical application in implant-based breast reconstruction
patients.
