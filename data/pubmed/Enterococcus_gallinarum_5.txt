BACKGROUND: Data on enterococcal bacteremia (EB) in immunocompromised children
are scarce. We aimed to describe EB in children with hematologic malignancies
(HM), solid tumors and/or following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT) and analyze their ampicillin and vancomycin resistance.
METHODS: We conducted an observational retrospective study in the tertiary-care
Hadassah University Medical Center (2001-2015). We collected demographic,
clinical and laboratory data on EB and compared ampicillin and vancomycin
sensitive with resistant episodes.
RESULTS: Fifty-six of 1123 children developed 74 episodes of EB; 62.1%
Enterococcus faecium, 36.5% Enterococcus faecalis; and 1.4% Enterococcus
gallinarum. EB developed in 12.1% of HSCT patients, 5.1% of HM, 6.3% of
neuroblastoma and 1.0% of other solid tumors patients. Of these episodes, 85.1%
were nosocomial, and 71.6% developed while on antibiotic therapy. Resistance
rates were: to ampicillin, 57.6%; to vancomycin (vancomycin-resistant
enterococci), 21.6%; and higher rates among E. faecium. Among
vancomycin-resistant enterococci, 1 of 16 was linezolid and 2 of 10 daptomycin
resistant. Overall 7- and 30-day mortality rates were 2.7% and 5.4%,
respectively. Thirty-day mortality was 18.2% in recurrent episodes and 0% in the 
first-time EB episodes (P = 0.006). In multivariate analysis, high treatment
intensity was associated with ampicillin resistance [odds ratio (OR) = 3.18, 95% 
confidence interval (CI): 1.31-9.12], prior penicillin exposure (OR = 7.50, 95%
CI: 1.41-39.81) and breakthrough on vancomycin (OR = 18.83, 95% CI: 3.31-101.14) 
with vancomycin resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: EB occurs mainly as a nosocomial infection in children receiving
high-intensity chemotherapy, especially in those with neuroblastoma, HM and
following HSCT. Antibiotic resistance is common. Vancomycin resistance can occur 
regardless of previous vancomycin use. Prognosis in immunocompromised children
with EB is better than previously reported. Recurrent EB is associated with
increased mortality.
