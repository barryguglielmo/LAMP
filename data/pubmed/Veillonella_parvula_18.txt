We hereby report the case of a primary acromioclavicular septic arthritis caused 
by Veillonella parvula. This bacteria is rare as a pathogen but is well known as 
a commensal of the lungs, vagina, mouth, and gastrointestinal tract of humans.
However, it may turn as an opportunistic pathogen. It was isolated in blood
culture and confirmed in biopsy specimen. The patient had complete recovery after
surgical washout with second look at postoperative day two and targeted
antibiotic treatment.
