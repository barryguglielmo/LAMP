Fluorophores SYTO 9 and propidium iodide (PI) are extensively applied in
medicine, food industry and environmental monitoring to assess the viability of
bacteria. However, the actual performance of these dyes remains largely unknown. 
In addition, their effects on the physiology of cells have not been elucidated.
Here we characterized the effects of these two dyes on Brevibacillus brevis under
optimized staining. We found that SYTO 9 entered cells continuously while PI
tended to adhere to the cell wall before entering the cell. In addition, results 
showed that a high amount of the dyes altered the physicochemical properties of
membranes, improving their breakthrough. These results provide new perspectives
and ideas for improving the characterization of bacterial viability using flow
cytometry.
