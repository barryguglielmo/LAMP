The antimicrobial efficacy of novel photodynamic inactivation and nanobubble
technologies was evaluated against Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Aeromonas
hydrophila as two important aquatic microbial pathogens. Photodynamic
inactivation results showed that LED (470 nm) and UV-A (400 nm)-activated
curcumin caused a complete reduction in V. parahaemolyticus at 4 and 22 Â°C, and a
greater than 2 log cfu/mL reduction in A. hydrophila, which was curcumin
concentration-dependent (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the photodynamic approach caused
a greater than 6 log cfu/mL V. parahaemolyticus reduction and more than 4 log
cfu/mL of A. hydrophila reduction in aquaponic water samples (p < 0.05). Our
results with the nanobubble technology showed that the nanobubbles alone did not 
significantly reduce bacteria (p > 0.05). However, a greater than 6 log cfu/mL A.
hydrophila reduction and a greater than 3 log cfu/mL of V. parahaemolyticus
reduction were achieved when nanobubble technology was combined with ultrasound
(p < 0.05). The findings described in this study illustrate the potential of
applying photodynamic inactivation and nanobubble-ultrasound antimicrobial
approaches as alternative novel methods for inactivating fish and shellfish
pathogens.
