Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease caused
by repeated inhalation of antigenic substances. We present a case of metalworking
fluids (MWFs)-HP sensitized to Pseudomonas oleovorans in a cystic fibrosis
patient. This case illustrates that HP diagnosis remains challenging, especially 
in patients with another pulmonary disease, and that serodiagnosis contributes to
identifying the precise microorganism involved. It also demonstrates that P.
oleovorans is an important secondary aetiological agent in MWF-HP, less known
than Mycobacterium immunogenum.
