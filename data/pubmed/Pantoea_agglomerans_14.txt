Background: Various clean-up techniques for heavy metals have been suggested and 
practiced for its biosorption from the contaminated or pollutant soil by using
chemical and physical methods. But most of the methods are hazardous to the
environment and expensive. This study was on how to determine the potential of
resident bacteria in the removal of heavy metals from contaminated soils in Abare
situated in Anka Local Government of Zamfara State, Nigeria. Thus, this study
employed bioremediation technique for removal of heavy metals.
Results: The preparation of Culture media and Isolation of bacteria of the
different contaminated soils were achieved by spread plate method. Whereas,
concentrations of the heavy metals (Lead (Pb), Copper (Cu) and Iron (Fe)) were
determined by Atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS. Pantoea agglomerans was
used for biosorption experiment. The concentrations of Pb ranged between 1.328 ± 
0.493 to 2.326 ± 2.093 mg/L, Cu 0.234 ± 0.117 to 1.054 ± 1.486 mg/L and Fe 18.498
± 11.462 to 27.754 ± 57.510 mg/L. The optimum temperature for biosorption
condition was found to be 35 °C. More so, the optimum pH of (7) was observed for 
maximum biosorption of Pb and Cu ions by Pantoea agglomerans which may be
attributed to homeostatic phenomenon and the availability of metal binding sites 
on the biosorbents. Metal uptake biosorption percentage revealed that Pantoea
agglomerans absorbed 99.6% of Pb, 60% of Cu and 96% of Fe.
Conclusion: This study revealed that Pantoea agglomerans potential for
bioremediation of the three metals.
