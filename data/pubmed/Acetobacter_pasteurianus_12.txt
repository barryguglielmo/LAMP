Acetobacter pasteurianus is an industrial strain used for the vinegar production.
Many A. pasteurianus strains with different phenotypic characteristics have been 
isolated so far. To understand the genetic background underpinning these
phenotypes, a comparative genomic analysis of A. pasteurianus strains was
conducted. Based on bioinformatics and experimental results, we report the
following. (i) The gene repertoire related to the respiratory chains showed that 
several horizontal gene transfer events occurred after the divergence of these
strains, indicating that the respiratory chain in A. pasteurianus has the
diversity to adapt to its environment. (ii) There is a clear difference in
thermotolerance even between 12 closely related strains. NBRC 3279, NBRC 3284,
and NBRC 3283, in particular, which have only 55 mutations in total, showed
differences in thermotolerance. The Na+/H+ antiporter gene nhaK2 was mutated in
the thermosensitive NBRC 3279 and NBRC 3284 strains and not in the thermotolerant
NBRC 3283 strain. The Na+/H+ antiporter activity of the three strains and
expression of nhaK2 gene from NBRC 3283 in the two thermosensitive strains showed
that these mutations are critical for thermotolerance. These results suggested
that horizontal gene transfer events and several mutations have affected the
phenotypes of these closely related strains.IMPORTANCE Acetobacter pasteurianus, 
an industrial vinegar-producing strain, exhibits diverse phenotypic differences
such as respiratory activity related to acetic acid production, acetic acid
resistance, or thermotolerance. In this study, we investigated the correlations
between genome sequences and phenotypes among closely related A. pasteurianus
strains. The gene repertoire related to the respiratory chains showed that the
respiratory components of A. pasteurianus has a diversity caused by several
horizontal gene transfers and mutations. In three closely related strains with
clear differences in their thermotolerances, we found that the insertion or
deletion that occurred in the Na+/H+ antiporter gene nhaK2 is directly related to
their thermotolerance. Our study suggests that a relatively quick mutation has
occurred in the closely related A. pasteurianus due to its genetic instability
and that this has largely affected its phenotype.
