BACKGROUND: The Flavobacteriaceae family includes rare pathogens in children;
Chryseobacterium indologenes and Elizabethkingia meningosepticum are the most
common pathogenic species, with a wide range of clinical presentations and high
mortality rate. Although rare, diagnosis is important due to inherent resistance 
to multiple antibiotics, especially those typically prescribed for empiric
treatment of aerobic Gram-negative bacterial infections.
METHODS: A multicenter retrospective study conducted in 5 Israeli hospitals,
describing Flavobacteriaceae bacteremia confirmed by positive blood culture from 
1998 to 2018.
RESULTS: Thirteen cases were included; 9 isolates were C. indologenes. Bacteremia
was nosocomial or healthcare-associated in all cases. Bacteremia was associated
with young age (median, 1 year, range 24 days-17 years), with only 2 (15.4%)
cases in neonates, Central line-associated bloodstream infection as a source
(5/13, 38%) and malignancy (7/13, 54.8%). Thirty-day all-cause mortality was 23% 
(3/13). Ninety-one percent of isolates were susceptible to
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 82% to piperacillin-tazobactam and 92% to
ciprofloxacin.
CONCLUSIONS: C. indologenes and E. meningosepticum are rare, nosocomial- or
healthcare-associated pediatric bacteremia pathogens. Bacteremia was associated
with young age, but in contrast to the literature, the majority of our cases were
older than the neonatal age period. In addition, they were associated with
central line-associated bloodstream infection and malignancy. The most adequate
antibiotics according to resistance patterns were ciprofloxacin,
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and piperacillin-tazobactam.
