Artisanal kefir is a traditional fermented dairy product made using kefir grains.
Kefir has documented natural antimicrobial activity and health benefits. A
typical kefir microbial community includes lactic acid bacteria (LAB), acetic
acid bacteria, and yeast among other species in a symbiotic matrix. In the
presented work, the 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to reveal bacterial
populations and elucidate the diversity and abundance of LAB species in
international artisanal kefirs from Fusion Tea, Britain, the Caucuses region,
Ireland, Lithuania, and South Korea. Bacterial species found in high abundance in
most artisanal kefirs included Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, Lentilactobacillus 
kefiri,Lactobacillus ultunensis, Lactobacillus apis, Lactobacillus gigeriorum,
Gluconobacter morbifer, Acetobacter orleanensis, Acetobacter pasteurianus,
Acidocella aluminiidurans, and Lactobacillus helveticus. Some of these bacterial 
species are LAB that have been reported for their bacteriocin production
capabilities and/or health promoting properties.
