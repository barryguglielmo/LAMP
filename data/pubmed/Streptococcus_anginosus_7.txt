Acute necrotizing pneumonia in an immunocompetent host is uncommon and usually
caused by Staphylococcus aureus infection. Streptococcus anginosus group (SAG) is
a less recognized cause of rapidly destructive lung infection resulting in
significant patient morbidity and mortality. Unlike many other bacterial
infections, SAG can cross fascial planes and cause fulminant infections.
Necrotizing pneumonia and lung abscesses due to SAG often fails conservative
therapy with antimicrobials and requires definitive surgical intervention.
Consideration of SAG as a potential etiology might help to institute definitive
therapy earlier and prevent complications.
