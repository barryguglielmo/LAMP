BACKGROUND: Brain abscesses, a severe infectious disease of the CNS, are usually 
caused by a variety of different pathogens, which include Streptococcus
intermedius (S. intermedius). Pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas (PAVFs),
characterized by abnormal direct communication between pulmonary artery and vein,
are a rare underlying cause of brain abscesses.
CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a previous healthy 55-year-old man who
presented with 5â€‰days of headache and fever. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) suggested a brain abscess. Thoracic CT scan and angiography demonstrated
PAVFs. Aiding by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of the
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample which identified S. intermedius as the causative
pathogen, the patient was switched to the single therapy of large dose of
penicillin G and was cured precisely and economically.
CONCLUSIONS: It is an alternative way to perform mNGS to identify causative
pathogens in patients with brain abscesses especially when the results of
traditional bacterial culture were negative. Further thoracic CT or pulmonary
angiography should also be undertaken to rule out PAVFs as the potential cause of
brain abscess if the patient without any known premorbid history.
