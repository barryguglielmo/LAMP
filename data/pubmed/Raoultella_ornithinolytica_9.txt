Raoultella ornithinolytica is an encapsulated Gram-negative, oxidase-negative,
catalase-positive, aerobic, non-motile rod that belongs to the Enterobacteriaceae
family. This bacterium was initially classified in the genus Klebsiella as
Klebsiella ornithinolytica, until the creation of the genus Raoultella in 2001.
R. ornithinolytica is usually found in water environments and soil, and due to
its ability to convert histidine to histamine, it has been associated with
histamine poisoning in humans. R. ornithinolytica is an emerging entity in human 
infections, with several reports of virulent infections in comorbid at-risk
patients. Increasing reports are potentially due to better and more precise
identification tools. The objective of this article is to provide a comprehensive
review of reported cases of R. ornithinolytica infections, the emergent virulence
of described multiresistant strains, and an overview of currently used
identification methods.
