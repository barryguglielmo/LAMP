ABSTRACT: Biofilms on the surface of food processing equipment act as potential
reservoirs of microbial contamination. Bacterial interactions are believed to
play key roles in both biofilm formation and antimicrobial tolerance. In this
study, Aeromonas hydrophila, Chryseobacterium oncorhynchi, and Pseudomonas
libanensis, which were previously isolated from Chinese raw milk samples, were
selected to establish two dual-species biofilm models (P. libanensis plus A.
hydrophila and P. libanensis plus C. oncorhynchi) on stainless steel at 7°C.
Subsequently, three disinfectants, hydrogen peroxide (100 ppm), peracetic acid
(100 ppm), and sodium hypochlorite (100 ppm), were used to treat the developed
sessile communities for 10 min. Structural changes after exposure to
disinfectants were analyzed with confocal laser scanning microscopy. The cell
numbers of both A. hydrophila and C. oncorhynchi recovered from surfaces
increased when grown as dual species biofilms with P. libanensis. Dual-species
biofilms were more tolerant of disinfectants than were each single-species
biofilm. Peracetic acid was the most effective disinfectant for removing
biofilms, followed by hydrogen peroxide and sodium hypochlorite. The results
expand the knowledge of mixed-species biofilms formed by psychrotrophic bacteria 
and will be helpful for developing effective strategies to eliminate bacterial
mixed-species biofilms.
