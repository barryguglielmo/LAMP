Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, especially gastric cancer and colorectal cancer
(CRC), represent a major global health burden. A large population of
microorganisms residing in the GI tract regulate physiological processes, such as
the immune response, metabolic balance, and homeostasis. Accumulating evidence
has revealed the alteration of microbial communities in GI tumorigenesis.
Experimental studies in cell lines and animal models showed the functional roles 
and molecular mechanisms of several bacteria in GI cancers, including
Helicobacter pylori in gastric cancer as well as Fusobacterium nucleatum,
Escherichia coli, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Bacteroides fragilis in CRC.
The transcriptional factor NF-κB plays a crucial role in the host response to
microbial infection through orchestrating innate and adaptive immune functions.
Moreover, NF-κB activity is linked to GI cancer initiation and development
through its induction of chronic inflammation, cellular transformation and
proliferation. Here, we provide an overview and discussion of modulation of the
NF-κB signaling pathway by microbiota, especially infectious bacteria, in GI
tumorigenesis, with a major focus on gastric cancer and CRC.
