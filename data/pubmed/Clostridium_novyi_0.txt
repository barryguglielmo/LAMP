Various cancer therapies have been developed, but tumor recurrence with
incomplete tumor killing and remaining tumor cells/tissues is frequent in
monotherapies. Herein, a nano-bio therapeutic emulsion formulated with
multifunctional nanoscintillators and anaerobic Clostridium novyi-NT spores for
synergistic image-guided combinational cancer therapy is reported. MRI visible
nanoscintillators (NSs) are synthesized with a NaGdF4 :Tb,Ce@NaGdF4 core/shell
structure for an image-guided X-ray photodynamic therapy (PDT) of the normoxic
peripheral tumor. An anaerobic oncolytic bacterium (C. novyi-NT) therapy is
combined to treat the hypoxic central tumor tissues. Photosensitizer-coated NSs
(PS-NSs) and C. novyi-NT spores are emulsified with clinically available
ethiodized oil (Lipiodol) to be the nano-bio therapeutic emulsion and injected
into the tumor with computed tomography image guidance. The distribution of
nano-bio therapeutic emulsion, including PS-NSs and anaerobic C. novyi-NT spores 
in the tumor site, is confirmed by both X-ray and T1 -weighted magnetic resonance
imaging. Following the image-guided X-ray PDT and anaerobic C. novyi- NT
combination treatment, apoptotic cell death in cancer tissues, including both
peripheral and central tumor regions, is significantly higher than in the control
groups. This combination therapy approach using a nano-bio therapeutic emulsion
is expected to overcome the limitations of conventional cancer therapy, resulting
in increased cancer-therapeutic efficacy.
