Glycoside hydrolase (GH) 87-type α-1,3-glucanase hydrolyses the α-1,3-glucoside
linkages of α-1,3-glucan, which is found in fungal cell walls and extracellular
polysaccharides produced by oral Streptococci. In this study, we report on the
molecular structure of the catalytic unit of GH 87-type α-1,3-glucanase, Agl-KA, 
from Bacillus circulans, as determined by x-ray crystallography at a resolution
of 1.82 Å. The catalytic unit constitutes a complex structure of two tandemly
connected domains-the N-terminal galactose-binding-like domain and the C-terminal
right-handed β-helix domain. While the β-helix domain is widely found among
polysaccharide-processing enzymes, complex formation with the
galactose-binding-like domain was observed for the first time. Biochemical assays
showed that Asp1067, Asp1090 and Asp1091 are important for catalysis, and these
residues are indeed located at the putative substrate-binding cleft, which forms 
a closed end and explains the product specificity.
