A glucose rich heteroglycan named HAW1-2 was isolated and purified from fruit of 
Crataegus pinnatifida by hot-water extraction, ethanol precipitation,
DEAE-cellulose anion exchange and gel permeation chromatography. HAW1-2 was
proved as a homogenous polysaccharide with a molecular weight (Mw) of 8.94 kDa.
Monosaccharide composition results indicated that HAW1-2 was composed of
arabinose, galactose and glucose. Methylation analysis and NMR spectrum showed
that HAW1-2 contained →4)-β-d-Glcp-(1→, →4)-β-d-Galp-(1→, α-L-Araf-(1→,
→5)-α-L-Araf-(1→, β-d-Glcp-(1→ and →4,6)-β-d-Glcp-(1→. Bioactivity test showed
that HAW1-2 could significantly promote the growth of Bacteroides thetaiotamicron
(BT), Bacteroides ovatus (BO) and Bifidobacterium longum (BL), which showed
competition with the Bacteroides spp. under co-culture. Interestingly,
Bacteroides spp. generated more acetic acids and propionic acids while BL only
generated acetic acids. These results imply that polysaccharide HAW1-2 may be
useful for human by modulating intestinal bacteria and producing short chain
fatty acids.
