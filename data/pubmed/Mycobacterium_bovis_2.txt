BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium bovis could infect patients with immunodeficiency or
immunosuppressive conditions via Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination.
Tuberculosis-related hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) is reported, but not HPS
caused by Mycobacterium bovis in children.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 4-month Chinese boy presented fever and cough. The initial
laboratory investigation showed the lymphocyte count of 0.97 × 109/L, which
decreased gradually. HPS was diagnosed based on the test results that fulfilled
the HLH-2004 criteria. In addition, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex was
detected from his peripheral blood via metagenomic next-generation sequencing
(mNGS) and M. bovis was identified by polymerase chain reaction-reverse dot blot 
(PCR-RDB). Thus, the patient was treated with Isoniazid, Rifampin, and
Pyrazinamide, but not improved. However, parents refused to accept further
therapy, and was discharged on the day 12 of admission. To confirm the
pathogenesis, genetic analysis was performed. Mutation in the interleukin-2
receptor subunit gamma gene: Exon 6: c.854G > A; p. Arg285Gln was detected in the
patient and the mother, which could underlie X-linked severe combined
immunodeficiency.
CONCLUSIONS: A boy with X-SCID was diagnosed with M. bovis-associated HPS,
emphasizing that X-SCID should be considered when M. bovis is detected in a male 
infant with low lymphocyte counts.
