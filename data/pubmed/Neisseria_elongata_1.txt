INTRODUCTION: Neisseria elongata, a gram-negative rod, has been identified in 23 
cases of pathogenesis in the literature, of which only 2 were osteomyelitis. Here
we report the third known case of isolated N. elongata cultures in a digital
osteomyelitis.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 63-year-old male with peripheral vascular disease and
lower extremity wounds presented to his vascular surgeon with right-handed
redness and pain requiring urgent surgical intervention. Irrigation, debridement,
and partial thumb amputation were performed, followed by treatment with a 6-week 
course of antibiotics.
DISCUSSION: N. elongata is a rare cause of osteomyelitis and unfamiliarity with
the causal organism and rod-like morphology may delay diagnosis and treatment.
CONCLUSION: Gram-negative coverage should be considered in high-risk populations 
with cellulitis to prevent progression to fulminant abscesses, suppurative
tenosynovitis and osteomyelitis.
