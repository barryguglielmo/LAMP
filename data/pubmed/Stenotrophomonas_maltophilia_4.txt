BACKGROUND: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (S. maltophilia) is an important
opportunistic pathogen that can be isolated in hospitals. With the abuse of broad
spectrum antibiotics and invasive surgical devices, the rate of S. maltophilia
infection is increasing every year. This study was an epidemiological analysis of
the clinical and molecular characteristics of S. maltophilia infection in a
Chinese teaching hospital. The goal was to obtain a comprehensive understanding
of the status of S. maltophilia infection to provide strong epidemiological data 
for the prevention and treatment of S. maltophilia infection.
RESULTS: A total of 93 isolates from Renji Hospital affiliated with the Shanghai 
Jiaotong University School of Medicine were included, in which 62 isolates were
from male patients. In addition, 81 isolates were isolated from sputum samples. A
total of 86 patients had underlying diseases. All patients received antibiotics. 
Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis indicated that 61 different sequence
types (STs) were found (including 45 novel STs), and MLST did not show
significantly dominant STs. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) results
showed that 93 isolates could be divided into 73 clusters, and they also showed
weak genetic linkages between isolates. The resistant rates to
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) and levofloxacin were 9.7 and 4.3%,
respectively, and all isolates were susceptible to minocycline. Four virulence
gene's loci Stmpr1, Stmpr2, Smf-1, and Smlt3773 were positive in 79.6, 91.4,
94.6, and 52.7% of the isolates, respectively. Three biofilm genes rmlA, spgM,
and rpfF were positive in 82.8, 92.5, and 64.5% of the isolates, respectively.
Mean biofilm forming level of OD492 was 0.54 ± 0.49. We did not find any
significant difference between different genders and different age-groups. We
retrospectively analyzed data from patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) and 
the control group. The independent risk factors of those who were infected in the
ICU included immunosuppression and the increased antibiotic usage.
CONCLUSIONS: Most of the patients had prior medical usage histories and baseline 
diseases. The positive rate of virulence genes was high, the drug resistance rate
of S. maltophilia was low, and the biofilm formation ability was strong. The
increased use of antibiotics was an independent risk factor for S. maltophilia
infection, which should receive more attention. No obvious clonal transmissions
were found in the same departments.
