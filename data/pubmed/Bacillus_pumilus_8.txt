Background: Previous research has shown that dietary supplementation of Bacillus 
spp. probiotics exerts beneficial effects on animals' growth. However, limited
studies have evaluated the efficacy of Bacillus spp. on weaned pigs and their
effects on host gut health and microbiome, and systemic immunity using a disease 
challenge model. The objective of this experiment was to investigate the effects 
of two Bacillus spp. strains (Bacillus subtilis DSM 32540 and Bacillus pumilus
DSM 32539) on growth performance, diarrhea, intestinal health, microbiome, and
systemic immunity of weaned pigs experimentally infected with an enterotoxigenic 
Escherichia coli (ETEC).
Results: Pigs in PRO1 (Bacillus subtilis DSM 32540) had greater (P < 0.05) body
weight on d 7 and 14 PI, greater (P < 0.05) ADG from d 0 to 7 and d 7 to 14 PI,
compared with pigs in CON (Control). Pigs in PRO1 had milder (P < 0.05) diarrhea 
on d 2 and 3 PI compared with pigs in CON. However, no differences were observed 
in growth performance and diarrhea score between PRO2 (Bacillus pumilus DSM
32539) and CON groups. Supplementation of PRO1 decreased (P < 0.05) lymphocyte
counts on d 7 and 14 PI, compared with CON. Supplementation of PRO1 and PRO2 both
reduced (P < 0.05) total coliforms in mesenteric lymph nodes on d 21 PI. Pigs in 
PRO2 had greater (P < 0.05) goblet cell number and sulfomucin percentage in
duodenal villi and greater (P < 0.05) sialomucin percentage in jejunal villi than
pigs in CON. Supplementation of PRO1 up-regulated (P < 0.05) MUC2 gene expression
in jejunal mucosa and reduced (P < 0.05) PTGS-2 and IL1B gene expression in ileal
mucosa on d 21 PI, compared with CON. Pigs in PRO1 had reduced (P < 0.05)
relative abundance of families Lachnospiraceae, Peptostreptococcaceae and
Pasteurellaceae in the ileum.
Conclusions: Supplementation of Bacillus subtilis DSM 32540 improved growth
performance, alleviated diarrhea severity, enhanced gut health, and reduced
systemic inflammation of weaned pigs infected with ETEC F18. Although Bacillus
pumilus DSM 32539 was able to alleviate systemic inflammation, it had limited
impacts on growth performance and severity of diarrhea of ETEC F18 challenged
weaned pigs.
