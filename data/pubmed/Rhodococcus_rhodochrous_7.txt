The aromatic substrate profile of the cobalt nitrile hydratase from Rhodococcus
rhodochrous ATCC BAA 870 was evaluated against a wide range of nitrile containing
compounds (>60). To determine the substrate limits of this enzyme, compounds
ranging in size from small (90 Da) to large (325 Da) were evaluated. Larger
compounds included those with a bi-aryl axis, prepared by the Suzuki coupling
reaction, Morita-Baylis-Hillman adducts, heteroatom-linked diarylpyridines
prepared by Buchwald-Hartwig cross-coupling reactions and imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines
prepared by the Groebke-Blackburn-Bienaymé multicomponent reaction. The enzyme
active site was moderately accommodating, accepting almost all of the small
aromatic nitriles, the diarylpyridines and most of the bi-aryl compounds and
Morita-Baylis-Hillman products but not the Groebke-Blackburn-Bienaymé products.
Nitrile conversion was influenced by steric hindrance around the cyano group, the
presence of electron donating groups (e.g., methoxy) on the aromatic ring, and
the overall size of the compound.
