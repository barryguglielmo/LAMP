Fructophilic lactic acid bacteria (FLAB), composed of Fructobacillus spp.,
Lactobacillus kunkeei, and Lactobacillus apinorum, are unique in that they prefer
d-fructose over d-glucose as a carbon source. Strain F192-5, isolated from the
peel of a satsuma mandarin and identified as Leuconostoc citreum, grows well on
d-fructose but poorly on d-glucose and produces mainly lactate and acetate, with 
trace amounts of ethanol, from the metabolism of d-glucose. These characteristics
are identical to those of obligate FLAB. However, strain F192-5 ferments a
greater variety of carbohydrates than known FLAB. Comparative analyses of the
genomes of strain F192-5 and reference strains of L. citreum revealed no signs of
specific gene reductions, especially genes involved in carbohydrate transport and
metabolism, in the genome of F192-5. The bifunctional alcohol/acetaldehyde
dehydrogenase gene (adhE) is conserved in strain F192-5 but is not transcribed.
This is most likely due to a deletion in the promoter region upstream of the adhE
gene. Strain F192-5 did, however, ferment d-glucose when transformed with a
plasmid containing the allochthonous adhE gene. L. citreum F192-5 is an example
of a pseudo-FLAB strain with a deficiency in d-glucose metabolism. This unique
phenotypic characteristic appears to be strain specific within the species L.
citreum This might be one of the strategies lactic acid bacteria use to adapt to 
diverse environmental conditions.IMPORTANCE Obligate fructophilic lactic acid
bacteria (FLAB) lack the metabolic pathways used in the metabolism of most
carbohydrates and differ from other lactic acid bacteria in that they prefer to
ferment d-fructose instead of d-glucose. These characteristics are well conserved
at the genus or species level. Leuconostoc citreum F192-5 shows similar growth
characteristics. However, the strain is metabolically and genomically different
from obligate FLAB. This is an example of a strain that evolved a pseudo-FLAB
phenotype to adapt to a fructose-rich environment.
