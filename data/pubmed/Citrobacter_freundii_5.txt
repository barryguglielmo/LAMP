Citrobacter freundii is one of the important bacterial diseases responsible for
disease outbreaks to wild and cultured fishes globally. However, no known
empirical research has focused on exploring relationships between immune response
after C. freundii infection in sturgeons. In this study, C. freundii was isolated
and identified from artificially breeding Chinese sturgeon, and global
measurement of transcriptome response to C. freundii infection in head-kidney and
spleen of A. sinensis were conducted to the acknowledgement of the potential
mechanisms of pathogen-host interaction triggered by the bacterial infection. In 
total, differentially expressed genes which significantly associated with immune 
responses were found to be participated in antigen processing and presentation
(MHC I, MHC II, HspA1, Hsp90A, Hsp70, CTSL, and CTSE), and acute phase response
(serotransferrin and CP), as well as changing of other immune-related cytokine,
such as chemokine and interferon, which proving their reacting and regulatory
role during the response of thehost against C. freundii infection in fish. C.
freundii can cause serious disease in sturgeon species was first reported in this
study, and innate immune responses to C. freundii infection in this study will be
conducive to understand the defense mechanisms and making appropriate prevention 
strategies in A. sinensis aquaculture operations.
