OBJECTIVES: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative process that affects 
the motor function and involves an inflammatory response and B vitamin
deficiencies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of B-group
vitamin-producing and immunomodulatory lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in a murine
model of PD.
METHODS: The effect of Lactobacillus plantarum CRL 2130 (a riboflavin producer), 
Streptococcus thermophilus CRL 807 (an immunomodulatory strain), and
Streptococcus thermophilus CRL 808 (a folate producer) were evaluated
individually and as a mixture in mice injected with
1-methyl-4-fenil-1,2,3,6-tetrahidropiridina. Motor capacity, tyrosine hydrolase
in the brain, and cytokine concentrations in serum and brain tissues were
evaluated in 1-methyl-4-fenil-1,2,3,6-tetrahidropiridina-treated mice after
bacterial supplementation.
RESULTS: The mice receiving the selected LAB showed significantly improved motor 
skills compared with those that did not receive bacterial supplementation. When
given the mixture of all 3 strains together, the animals had higher brain
tyrosine hydrolase-positive cell counts, decreased inflammatory cytokines
interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha in serum, and increased
antiinflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 in serum and brain tissues compared with
animals that did not receive LAB supplementation.
CONCLUSIONS: The results showed the potential of a selected LAB mixture to
improve motor behavior and neuroinflammation in PD. This probiotic mixture could 
be used as an adjunct treatment in the control of PD.
