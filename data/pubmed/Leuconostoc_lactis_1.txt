BACKGROUND: Probiotics are being considered as valuable microorganisms related to
human health. Hu sheep is referred as one of the important sheep breeds in China.
Goat milk produced by Hu sheep is characterized with high nutritional value and
hypoallergenic in nature. Particularly, this milk contains plenty of milk
prebiotic and probiotic bacteria. This study was aimed to scrutinize more
bacterial strains from Hu sheep milk with potential probiotic activity.
RESULTS: Based on 16S rRNA sequence analysis, pool of forty bacterial strains
were identified and evaluated their antimicrobial activities against
Staphylococcus aureus, enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), Salmonella
typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and Aeromonas 
caviae. Four out of these isolated strains demonstrated their efficient
bacteriostatic ability and potential healthy properties. We also examined the
safety aspects of these bacterial candidates including three Lactococcus lactis
strains (named as HSM-1, HSM-10, and HSM-18) and one Leuconostoc lactis strain
(HSM-14), and were further evaluated via in vitro tests, including antimicrobial 
activity, cell surface characteristics (hydrophobicity, co-aggregation, and
self-aggregation), heat treatment, antibiotic susceptibility, simulated transport
tolerance in the gastrointestinal tract, and acid/bile tolerance. The obtained
results revealed that HSM-1, HSM-10, HSM-14, and HSM-18 showed high survival rate
at different conditions for example low pH, presence of bovine bile and
demonstrated high hydrophobicity. Moreover, HSM-14 had an advantage over other
strains in terms of gastrointestinal tract tolerance, antimicrobial activities
against pathogens, and these results were significantly better than other
bacterial candidates.
CONCLUSION: Hu sheep milk as a source of exploration of potential lactic acid
bacteria (LAB) probiotics open the new horizon of probiotics usage from
unconventional milk sources. The selected LAB strains are excellent probiotic
candidates which can be used for animal husbandry in the future. Rationale of the
study was to utilize Hu sheep milk as a source of potential probiotic LABs. The
study has contributed to the establishment of a complete bacterial resource pool 
by exploring the Hu sheep milk microflora.
