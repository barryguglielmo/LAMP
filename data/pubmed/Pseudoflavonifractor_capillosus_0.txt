BACKGROUND: Cyclocarya paliurus polysaccharide (CCPP), a primary active component
in the leaves of Cyclocarya paliurus (Batal.) Iljinsk (C. paliurus), has the
ability to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but cannot be digested by our
digestive system. Therefore, mechanisms of regulating the gut microbiota and
intestinal metabolites might exist.
PURPOSE: To reveal the potential mechanism of CCPP treatment, this study aimed to
investigate the alterations of the gut microbiota and intestinal metabolites
especially short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in type 2 diabetic rats.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Type 2 diabetic rat models were developed, and the
therapeutic effects of CCPP were evaluated. Metagenomics analysis was utilized to
analyze the alterations to the gut microbiota, and UHPLC-QTOF/MS-based untargeted
metabolomics analysis of colon contents was used to identify the differential
intestinal metabolites. GC/MS was used to measure the SCFAs in rat's colon
contents and human fecal inoculums. Furthermore, the expression of SCFA receptors
including GPR41, GPR43 and GPR109a was verified by qRT-PCR and the concentration 
of glucagon-like peptide-1(GLP-1) and peptide tyrosinetyrosine (PYY) was measured
by Elisa.
RESULTS: Inhibition of the blood glucose levels and improvements in glucose
tolerance and serum lipid parameters were observed after CCPP treatment. Eleven
SCFA-producing species including Ruminococcus_bromii, Anaerotruncus_colihominis, 
Clostridium_methylpentosum, Roseburia_intestinalis, Roseburia_hominis,
Clostridium_asparagiforme, Pseudoflavonifractor_capillosus,
Intestinimonas_butyriciproducens, Intestinimonas_sp._GD2,
Oscillibacter_valericigenes and Oscillibacter_ruminantium were clearly increased 
in the CCPP group. Furthermore, our study indicated that CCPP increases the
production of SCFAs both in vivo and in vitro, and the gut microbiota are the key
factor of this process. The SCFA receptors including GPR41, GPR43 and GPR109a,
were significantly stimulated in the CCPP treated rats, which was accompanied by 
the upregulated expression of GLP-1 and PYY.
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that CCPP could alleviate type 2 diabetic 
symptoms by increasing the SCFA-producing bacteria, promoting the production of
SCFAs and upregulating SCFA-GLP1/PYY associated sensory mediators.
