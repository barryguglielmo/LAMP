KBP-7072 is a novel third-generation tetracycline (aminomethylcycline)
antibacterial that overcomes common efflux and ribosomal protection resistance
mechanisms that cause resistance in older-generation tetracyclines. KBP-7072
completed phase 1 clinical development studies for safety, tolerability, and
pharmacokinetics (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02454361) and multiple
ascending doses in healthy subjects (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02654626)
in December 2015. Both oral and intravenous formulations of KBP-7072 are being
developed. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro activities of KBP-7072 and
comparator agents by CLSI document M07 (2018) broth microdilution against 531
recent geographically diverse and/or molecularly characterized Acinetobacter
baumannii-A. calcoaceticus species complex (A. baumannii) isolates from the
United States, Europe, Asia-Pacific (excluding China), and Latin America. A.
baumannii isolates included carbapenem-resistant, colistin-resistant,
tetracycline-resistant, and extended-spectrum-β-lactamase (ESBL)- and
metallo-β-lactamase (MBL)-producing isolates. Overall, KBP-7072 (MIC50/90,
0.25/1 mg/liter) was comparable in activity to colistin (92.8%/92.8% susceptible 
[S] [CLSI/EUCAST]) against A. baumannii isolates, inhibiting 99.2% of isolates at
≤2 mg/liter and 97.6% of isolates at ≤1 mg/liter. KBP-7072 was equally active
against A. baumannii isolates, including carbapenem-resistant,
colistin-resistant, and tetracycline-resistant isolates, regardless of geographic
location, and maintained activity against ESBL- and MBL-producing isolates.
KBP-7072 outperformed comparator agents, including ceftazidime (40.3% S [CLSI]), 
gentamicin (48.2%/48.2% S [CLSI/EUCAST]), levofloxacin (39.5%/37.9% S
[CLSI/EUCAST]), meropenem (42.0%/42.0% S [CLSI/EUCAST]), piperacillin-tazobactam 
(33.3% S [CLSI]), and all tetracycline-class comparator agents, which include
doxycycline (67.3% S [CLSI]), minocycline (73.8% S [CLSI]), tetracycline (37.2% S
[CLSI]), and tigecycline (79.5% inhibited by ≤2 mg/liter). The potent in vitro
activity of KBP-7072 against recent geographically diverse, molecularly
characterized, and drug-resistant A. baumannii isolates supports continued
clinical development for the treatment of serious infections, including those
caused by A. baumannii.
