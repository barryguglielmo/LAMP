The source of secondary lower respiratory tract bacterial infections in influenza
patients is not fully understood. A case-control study was conducted during the
2017-2018 influenza epidemic period in Beijing, China. Nasopharyngeal swabs were 
collected from 52 virologically confirmed influenza patients and 24 healthy
medical staff. The nasopharyngeal microbiota taxonomic composition was analysed
using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 regions. The
super-dominant pathobiontic bacterial genus (SDPG) was defined as that accounting
for >50% of sequences in a nasopharyngeal swab. We attempted to isolate bacteria 
of this genus from both nasopharyngeal swabs and lower-respiratory tract samples 
and analyse their genetic similarities. We observed a significantly lower
taxonomy richness in influenza cases compared with healthy controls. A SDPG was
detected in 61% of severe cases but in only 24% of mild cases and 29% of healthy 
controls. In 10 cases, the species isolated from lower-respiratory tract
infection sites were identified as belonging to the nasopharyngeal microbiota
SDPG. Genetically identical strains were isolated from both nasopharyngeal swabs 
and lower-respiratory tract infection sites, including 23 Acinetobacter baumannii
strains from six severe cases, six Klebsiella pneumoniae strains from two severe 
cases, five Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains from one severe and one mild case, and
four Corynebacterium striatum strains from two severe cases. The SDPG in the
nasopharyngeal microbiota are the likely cause of subsequent infection in
influenza patients.
