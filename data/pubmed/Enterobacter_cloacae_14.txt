2,3-Dihydroxyisovalerate is an intermediate of the valine synthesis pathway.
However, neither natural microorganisms nor valine producing engineered strains
have been reported yet to produce this chemical. Based on the 2,3-butanediol
synthesis pathway, a biological route of 2,3-dihydroxyisovalerate production was 
developed using a budA and ilvD disrupted Klebsiella pneumoniae strain in our
previous research. We hypothesised, that other 2,3-butanediol producing bacteria 
could be used for 2,3-dihydroxyisovalerate production. Here a budA disrupted
Enterobacter cloacae was constructed, and this strain exhibited a high
2,3-dihydroxyisovalerate producing ability. Disruption of ilvD in E. cloacae
ΔbudA further increased 2,3-dihydroxyisovalerate level. The disruption of budA,
encoding an acetolactate decarboxylase, resulted in the acetolactate synthesized 
in the 2,3-butanediol synthesis pathway to flow into the valine synthesis
pathway. The additional disruption of ilvD, encoding a dihydroxy acid
dehydratase, prevented the 2,3-dihydroxyisovalerate to be further metabolized in 
the valine synthesis pathway. Thus, the disruption of both budA and ilvD in
2,3-butanediol producing strains might be an universal strategy for
2,3-dihydroxyisovalerate accumulation. After optimization of the medium
components and culture parameters 31.2 g/L of 2,3-dihydroxyisovalerate was
obtained with a productivity of 0.41 g/L h and a substrate conversion ratio of
0.56 mol/mol glucose in a fed-batch fermentation. This approach provides an
economic way for 2,3-dihydroxyisovalerate production.
