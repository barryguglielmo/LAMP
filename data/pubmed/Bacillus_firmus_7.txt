Groundwater arsenic pollution causes millions of deaths worldwide. Long term
natural and anthropogenic activities have increased arsenic levels in groundwater
causing higher threats of arsenic exposure. Arsenic hyper-tolerant Firmicute
Bacillus firmus L-148 was isolated from arsenic limiting Lonar lake soil, which
tolerated more than 3 M arsenic and could oxidize 75 mM arsenite [As(III)] in 14 
days. It oxidized As(III) in presence of heavy metals and had unusual pH optima
at 9.2. B. firmus L-148 was studied at the biochemical, protein, genomic and
transcript level for understanding its arsenic oxidizing machinery. The proteomic
and transcript analysis exhibited the presence of ars and aio operon and
supported the inducible nature of ars operon. Robust, hyper-tolerant, fast
As(III) oxidizing, least nutrient requiring and multi-metal resistance qualities 
of the strain were used in microcosm studies for bioremediation. Artificial
groundwater mimicking microcosm with 75 mM As(III) was developed. Modulation of
carbon source, iron and multi metals affected growth and As(III) oxidation rate. 
The As(III) oxidation was recorded to be 77% in 15 days in presence of sodium
acetate and Fe ions. This microcosm study can be explored for bioremediation of
arsenic contaminated water and followed by precipitation using other methods.
