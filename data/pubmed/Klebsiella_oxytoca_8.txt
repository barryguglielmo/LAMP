This study was undertaken to evaluate the antibiogram fingerprints of some
Enterobacteria recovered from irrigation water and agricultural soil in two
District Municipalities of the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa using standard
culture-based and molecular methods. The prevalent resistance patterns in the
isolates follow the order: Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium [tetracycline 
(92.3%), ampicillin (69.2%)]; Enterobacter cloacae [amoxicillin/clavulanic acid
(77.6%), ampicillin (84.5%), cefuroxime (81.0%), nitrofurantoin (81%), and
tetracycline (80.3%)]; Klebsiella pneumoniae [amoxicillin/clavulanic acid
(80.6%), ampicillin (88.9%), and cefuroxime (61.1%)]; and Klebsiella oxytoca
[chloramphenicol (52.4%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (61.9%), ampicillin
(61.9%), and nitrofurantoin (61.9%)]. Antibiotic resistance genes detected
include tetC (86%), sulII (86%), and blaAmpC (29%) in Salmonella enterica serovar
Typhimurium., tetA (23%), tetB (23%), tetC (12%), sulI (54%), sulII (54%), catII 
(71%), blaAmpC (86%), blaTEM (43%), and blaPER (17%) in Enterobacter cloacae.,
tetA (20%), tetC (20%), tetD (10%), sulI (9%), sulII (18%), FOX (11%) and CIT
(11%)-type plasmid-mediated AmpC, blaTEM (11%), and blaSHV (5%) in Klebsiella
pneumoniae and blaAmpC (18%) in Klebsiella oxytoca. Our findings document the
occurrence of some antibiotic-resistant Enterobacteria in irrigation water and
agricultural soil in Amathole and Chris Hani District Municipalities, Eastern
Cape Province of South Africa, thus serving as a potential threat to food safety.
