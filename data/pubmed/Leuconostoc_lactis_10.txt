Leuconostoc lactis CCK940, which exhibits glycosyltransferase activity, produces 
oligosaccharides using sucrose and maltose as donor and receptor molecules,
respectively. The oligosaccharides produced were purified by Bio-gel P2
chromatography and the purified oligosaccharides (CCK-oligosaccharides) consisted
of only glucose. 1H-NMR analysis revealed that the CCK-oligosaccharides were
composed of 77.6% α-1,6 and 22.4% α-1,4 glycosidic linkages, and the molecular
weight of the CCK-oligosaccharides was found to be 9.42 × 102 Da. To determine
the prebiotic effect of the CCK-oligosaccharides, various carbon sources were
added in modified media. Growth of six probiotic strains, Lactobacillus casei, L.
pentosus, L. plantarum, Weissella cibaria, Bifidobacterim animalis, and
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was better when the CCK-oligosaccharides were used as
the sole carbon source compared to fructo-oligosaccharides, which are widely used
as prebiotics. These results showed that the CCK-oligosaccharides produced from
Leu. lactis CCK940 could serve as good candidates for novel prebiotics.
