OBJECTIVES: Clostridium species of the order Clostridiales are mostly strictly
anaerobic rod-shaped bacteria. They can be detected in a variety of environments,
including the intestines of humans and animals, soil, water, and biogas reactors.
Species of the genus Clostridium are widely used in various biotechnological
processes, but several of them have been identified as significant human
pathogens. Therefore, investigation at the genome level is necessary to provide
valuable information about the ecology, genetics, and phylogenetic diversity of
various Clostridium species.
DATA DESCRIPTION: In the present study, we report the whole genome sequence of
Clostridium jeddahense strain EE-R19, which was isolated from a mesophilic
anaerobic digester. The draft genome of C. jeddahense EE-R19 consisted of 59
contigs (> 500 bp), which amounted to 3,562,974 with an overall G + C content of 
51.79%. The whole genome shotgun project of C. jeddahense EE-R19 has been
deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession number JAAVNF000000000.
