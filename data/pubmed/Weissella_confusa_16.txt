Galactan exopolysaccharide (EPS) produced by Weissella confusa KR780676 isolated 
from an Indian traditional fermented food has been reported earlier. In this
manuscript, we have studied aflatoxin-binding ability of this galactan EPS.
Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) binding ability of galactan EPS was observed in an increasing
trend with increasing EPS concentration (20-100 mg/mL). At lower concentrations
(< 20 mg/mL) of EPS, the binding activity was undetectable, while notable binding
was seen from 30 mg/mL. Enhanced AFB1 binding (32.40%) was recorded at 50 mg/mL
of EPS and it increased gradually up to 34.79% at 100 mg/mL concentrations of
EPS. The intensity of bands in high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC)
analysis confirms the AFB1 binding efficiency of galactan EPS, which shows its
potential application for removal of toxins in food and feed industry. Galactan
EPS binding activity to AFB1 is further studied with particle size analysis
(PSA). This is the first study reporting the aflatoxin-binding activity of any
kind of EPS from lactic acid bacteria.
