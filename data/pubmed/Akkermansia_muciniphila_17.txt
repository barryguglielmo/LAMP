Quantitative metagenomic studies have linked the gut microbiota to autoimmune
disorders. Here, we performed deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing of fecal
samples from 99 immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) patients and 52 healthy controls.
Dysbiosis in the gut microbiome of ITP was detected phylogenetically and
functionally, and classifier based on species markers distinguished individuals
with ITP from healthy controls. In particular, the abundance of Ruminococcus
gnavus, Bifidobacterium longum and Akkermansia muciniphila was markedly increased
in treatment-naïve ITP patients, and the alterations of microbial species were
correlated with clinical indices. Functionally, the secondary bile acid
biosynthesis and flagellar assembly were depleted in the gut microbiota of ITP,
which may contribute to the onset of ITP by affecting the immune system.
Furthermore, we found that corticosteroid treatment affected the gut microbiome
of ITP. Compared with corticosteroid-sensitive ITP patients, we identified that
the corticosteroid-resistant ITP patients displayed a distinct gut microbiome,
which was different from that of the treatment-naïve ITP patients. Together, we
provided support for the critical role of gut microbiota in the development of
ITP and established a foundation for further research characterizing gut
microbiota in relation to corticosteroid resistance of ITP.
