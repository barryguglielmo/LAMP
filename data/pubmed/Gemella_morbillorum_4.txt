A 66-year-old man presented with upper back cellulitis and imaging findings
consistent with a necrotising soft tissue infection. He was started on
broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics and was taken to the operating room for
immediate surgical debridement. On postoperative day 5, the culture was noted to 
be growing Gemella morbillorum, an exceedingly rare cause of necrotising soft
tissue infections in immunocompetent hosts. His condition improved, and he was
transitioned to oral antibiotics and discharged home.
