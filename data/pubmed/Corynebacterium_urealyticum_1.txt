Introduction: Encrusted cystitis and pyelitis are a rare urinary tract infection 
characterized by mold-like calcification of collecting system. Here, we show a
case of encrusted cystitis proceeding to pyelitis during a 1-month delay in
diagnosis.
Case presentation: A 73-year-old man developed hematuria and pain during
micturition while he was being treated for granulomatosis with polyangiitis and
lung abscess. Cystoscopy revealed calcification of the bladder wall, and an
initial diagnosis of a bladder stone was made. While awaiting surgery, the
bladder wall calcification extended to the renal pelvis on both sides, with renal
failure. He underwent bilateral nephrostomy replacement and bladder irrigation
with Solita T1 and was administered intravenous vancomycin. Calcification almost 
regressed after 4 weeks of treatment.
Conclusion: Encrusted cystitis and pyelitis should be suspected if the patient
shows alkaline urine and urothelial mucosa calcification. Appropriate treatment
includes antibiotics, urine drainage, and chemolysis by bladder irrigation.
