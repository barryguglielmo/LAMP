American foulbrood (AFB) is a highly virulent disease afflicting honey bees (Apis
mellifera). The causative organism, Paenibacillus larvae, attacks honey bee brood
and renders entire hives dysfunctional during active disease states, but more
commonly resides in hives asymptomatically as inactive spores that elude even
vigilant beekeepers. The mechanism of this pathogenic transition is not fully
understood, and no cure exists for AFB. Here, we evaluated how hive
supplementation with probiotic lactobacilli (delivered through a nutrient patty; 
BioPatty) affected colony resistance towards a naturally occurring AFB outbreak. 
Results demonstrated a significantly lower pathogen load and proteolytic activity
of honey bee larvae from BioPatty-treated hives. Interestingly, a distinctive
shift in the microbiota composition of adult nurse bees occurred irrespective of 
treatment group during the monitoring period, but only vehicle-supplemented nurse
bees exhibited higher P. larvae loads. In vitro experiments utilizing
laboratory-reared honey bee larvae showed Lactobacillus plantarum Lp39,
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1, and Lactobacillus kunkeei BR-1 (contained in the
BioPatty) could reduce pathogen load, upregulate expression of key immune genes, 
and improve survival during P. larvae infection. These findings suggest the usage
of a lactobacilli-containing hive supplement, which is practical and affordable
for beekeepers, may be effective for reducing enzootic pathogen-related hive
losses.
