OBJECTIVES: To describe the population structure, molecular epidemiology and
genetic context of blaKPC-2-bearing Klebsiella pneumoniae.
METHODS: Isolates (n = 157) were retrospective, phenotypically
carbapenem-resistant blaKPC-positive K. pneumoniae, collected from public
hospitals. WGS was performed on the Illumina platform. Phylogenomic analysis,
screening of resistance and virulence genes, and comparison of the genetic
environment of blaKPC were carried out.
RESULTS: Based on core-tree phylogeny, 67.5% of the isolates were K. pneumoniae
and the remainder comprised Klebsiella quasipneumoniae. No Klebsiella variicola
strains were observed. Only a single K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) variant
type, blaKPC-2, was seen. MLSTs were diverse and did not comprise the
'traditional' KPC clonal group (CG) 258. blaKPC-2 was associated with a
non-Tn4401 element (NTE) in >99% of genomes. Screening for four key virulence
loci: yersiniabactin (ybt), aerobactin (iuc), salmochelin (iro) and colibactin
(clb) as well as ICEKp (virulence-associated integrative conjugative element of
K. pneumoniae), revealed the lack of virulence factors and ICEKp within K.
quasipneumoniae. Amongst the K. pneumoniae, there were 32 ybt+ isolates (32/106, 
30.2%) and, of these, 8 isolates were also clb+ (7.5%). K. pneumoniae serotypes
K1 and K2, the majority of capsular serotype seen in patients with invasive liver
abscess syndrome, were detected at 4.5% (7/157).
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that dissemination of blaKPC-2 is driven by NTEKPC
in non-ST258 isolates. The detection of blaKPC-2K. pneumoniae serotypes K1/K2
carrying virulence factors, albeit in low numbers, reflects the worrisome
convergence of carbapenem resistance and hypervirulence in K. pneumoniae.
