Objective: Feed additives that modify rumen fermentation can be used to prevent
metabolic disturbances such as acidosis and optimize beef cattle production. The 
study evaluated the effects of liquid and powdered forms of polyclonal antibody
preparation (PAP) against Streptococcus bovis and Fusobacterium necrophorum on
rumen fermentation parameters in ruminally cannulated non-lactating dairy cows
that were adapted or unadapted to a high concentrate diet.
Methods: A double 3 × 3 Latin square design was used with three PAP treatments
(control, powdered and liquid PAP) and two adaptation protocols (adapted,
unadapted; applied to the square). Adapted animals were transitioned for 2 weeks 
from an all-forage to an 80% concentrate diet, while unadapted animals were
switched abruptly.
Results: Interactions between sampling time and adaptation were observed; 12 h
after feeding, the adapted group had lower ruminal pH and greater total short
chain fatty acid concentrations than the unadapted group, while the opposite was 
observed after 24 h. Acetate:propionate ratio, molar proportion of butyrate and
ammonia nitrogen concentration were generally greater in adapted than unadapted
cattle up to 36 h after feeding. Adaptation promoted 3.5 times the number of
Entodinium protozoa but copy numbers of S. bovis and Fibrobacter succinogens
genes in rumen fluid were not affected. However, neither liquid nor powdered
forms of PAP altered rumen acidosis variables in adapted or unadapted animals.
Conclusion: Adaptation of cattle to highly fermentable carbohydrate diets
promoted a more stable ruminal environment, but PAP was not effective in this
study in which no animal experienced acute or sub-acute rumen acidosis.
