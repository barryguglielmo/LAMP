This review aims to summarize recent discoveries and advancements regarding the
characteristics of Staphylococcus agnetis (S. agnetis) and its role in poultry
pathology. S. agnetis is an emerging pathogen that was primarily associated with 
mastitis in dairy cattle. After a presumed host jump from cattle to poultry, it
was identified as a pathological agent in broiler chickens (Gallus gallus
domesticus), causing lameness induced by bacterial chondronecrosis with
osteomyelitis (BCO), septicemia, and valvular endocarditis. Economic and welfare 
losses caused by lameness are global problems in the poultry industry, and S.
agnetis has been shown to have a potential to induce high incidences of lameness 
in broiler chickens. S. agnetis exhibits a distinct repertoire of virulence
factors found in many different staphylococci. It is closely related to S. hyicus
and S. chromogenes, hence infections caused by S. agnetis may be misdiagnosed or 
even undiagnosed. As there are very few reports on S. agnetis in poultry, many
facts about its pathogenesis, epidemiology, routes of transmission, and the
potential impacts on the poultry industry remain unknown.
