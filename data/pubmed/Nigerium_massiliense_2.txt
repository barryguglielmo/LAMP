The subspecies classification of Mycobacteroides abscessus complex into M.
abscessus, M. massiliense and M. bolletii requires the amplification and
sequencing of multiple genes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the
possibility of subspecies classification using a single PCR target. An in silico 
study was performed to classify 1613 strains deposited in a public database using
9 genes (partial gene sequences of hsp65, rpoB, sodA, argH, cya, glpK, gnd, and
murC, and the full gene sequence of MAB_3542c). We found the housekeeping gene
gnd to be able to classify the M. abscessus subspecies with high accuracy
(99.94%). A single-gene PCR approach based on gnd would be a suitable replacement
for the more expensive, labor-intensive and time-consuming multi-gene PCR
analysis currently in use for the subspecies identification of M. abscessus.
