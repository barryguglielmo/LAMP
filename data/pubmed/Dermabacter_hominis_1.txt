We investigated the clinical relevance of Dermabacter hominis isolated from
samples of 108 patients. Polymicrobial growth was evident in 88% of specimens.
Isolation of D. hominis was of definitive or possible significance in only 14% of
patients. Vancomycin remains the drug of choice given a penicillin resistance
rate of 84%.
