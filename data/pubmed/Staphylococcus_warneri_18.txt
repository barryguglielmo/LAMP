Many studies have shown that the space environment can affect bacteria by causing
a range of mutations. However, to date, few studies have explored the effects of 
long-term spaceflight (>1 month) on bacteria. In this study, a Staphylococcus
warneri strain that was isolated from the Shenzhou-10 spacecraft and had
experienced a spaceflight (15 days) was carried into space again. After a 64-day 
flight, combined phenotypic, genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses were
performed to compare the influence of the two spaceflights on this bacterium.
Compared with short-term spaceflight, long-term spaceflight increased the biofilm
formation ability of S. warneri and the cell wall resistance to external
environmental stress but reduced the sensitivity to chemical stimulation. Further
analysis showed that these changes might be associated with the significantly
upregulated gene expression of the phosphotransferase system, which regulates the
metabolism of sugars, including glucose, mannose, fructose, and cellobiose. The
mutation of S. warneri caused by the 15-day spaceflight was limited at the
phenotype and gene level after cultivation on the ground. After 79 days of
spaceflight, significant changes in S. warneri were observed. The
phosphotransferase system of S. warneri was upregulated by long-term space
stimulation, which resulted in a series of changes in the cell wall, biofilm, and
chemical sensitivity, thus enhancing the resistance and adaptability of the
bacterium to the external environment.
