The aim of the study was to examine the influence of single and consortia
treatments of drought tolerant rhizobacteria producing ACC deaminase together
with additional plant growth promoting (PGP) characteristics on finger millet
growth, antioxidant and nutrient concentration under water-stressed and irrigated
(no stress) conditions. These rhizobacteria belong to the Variovorax sp.
Achromobacter spp. Pseudomonas spp. and Ochrobactrum sp. The single inoculant of 
RAA3 (Variovorax paradoxus) and a consortium inoculant of four bacteria, i.e.,
DPC9 (Ochrobactrum anthropi), DPB13 (Pseudomonas palleroniana), DPB15
(Pseudomonas fluorescens) and DPB16 (Pseudomonas palleroniana), significantly
boosted the overall growth parameters and nutrient concentrations in leaves of
finger millet. Moreover, elevated levels of the reactive oxygen species
scavenging enzymes-superoxide dismutase (17.3%, 11.6%), guaiacol peroxidase
(38.7%, 22.2%), catalase (33.7%, 21.3%) and ascorbate peroxidase (18.2%, 10.0%); 
cellular osmolytes-proline (41.5%, 25.0%), phenol (44.5%, 37.5%); higher leaf
chlorophyll (64.4%, 30.8%) and a reduced level of hydrogen peroxide (50.7%,
59.5%) and malondialdehyde (48.4%,72.5%) were noted, respectively, after single
inoculation of RAA3 and a consortium treatment by strains
DPC9 + DPB13 + DPB15 + DPB16, in contrast with non-treated plants mainly under
water-stressed conditions. This finding clearly illustrates that PGPB that
express ACC deaminase along with additional PGP traits could be an efficient
approach for improving plant health in environments, where agricultural practices
are reliant on rain for water.
