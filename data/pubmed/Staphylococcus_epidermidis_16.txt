BACKGROUND: The aim of this prospective study was to use direct matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to
rapidly diagnose periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs).
METHOD: Synovial fluid was taken from 77 patients (80 joints, 41 hips and 39
knees) who met the International Consensus Meeting criteria for PJI, and
inoculated into blood culture bottles (BCBs) and onto conventional swabs.
Positive blood cultures were analyzed using either direct or routine MALDI-TOF
MS. Pathogen identification and the time to identification was recorded.
Differences between groups were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and
Bonferroni's post-hoc test.
RESULTS: Direct and routine MALDI-TOF MS both detected 64 positive results (80%),
compared to 47 (59%) by conventional swabs (p = 0.002). Direct MALDI-TOF MS
identified 85.3% of the gram-positive organisms and 92.3% of the gram-negative
organisms. No fungi were identified by direct MALDI-TOF MS. In 17 BCBs that were 
flagged positive, identification by direct MALDI-TOF MS failed. Among the
positive results in the direct MALDI-TOF MS group, Staphylococcus aureus
accounted for 47%, followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (17%), Escherichia coli
(9%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (9%). The median time to microorganism
identification was significantly shorter with direct MALDI-TOF MS (12.7 h, IQR:
8.9-19.6 h) than with routine MALDI-TOF MS (39.5 h, IQR: 22.8-46.0 h) or swabs
(44.4 h, IQR: 27.2-72.6 h) (p < 0.0001). In pairwise comparisons, there were
significant differences in the time of microorganism identification between
direct MALDI-TOF MS and routine MALDI-TOF MS (p < 0.0001) or swab culture (p <
0.0001). There was no significant difference between routine MALDI-TOF MS and
swab culture (p = 0.0268).
CONCLUSION: Compared with current laboratory practice, direct MALDI-TOF MS
shortened the time to microorganism identification and had superior results
compared to conventional swabs, except for fungi. Further studies should
investigate whether the earlier administration of appropriate antimicrobial
agents can improve the treatment outcomes of PJIs.
