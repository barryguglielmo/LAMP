l-Carnitine is essential in the intermediary metabolism of eukaryotes and is
involved in the β-oxidation of medium- and long-chain fatty acids; thus, it has
applications for medicinal purposes and as a dietary supplement. In addition,
l-carnitine plays roles in bacterial physiology and metabolism, which have been
exploited by the industry to develop biotechnological carnitine production
processes. Here, on the basis of studies of l-carnitine metabolism in Escherichia
coli and its activation by the transcriptional activator CaiF, a biosensor was
developed. It expresses a fluorescent reporter gene that responds in a
dose-dependent manner to crotonobetainyl-CoA, which is an intermediate of
l-carnitine metabolism in E. coli and is proposed to be a coactivator of CaiF.
Moreover, a dual-input biosensor for l-carnitine and crotonobetaine was
developed. As an application of the biosensor, potential homologues of the
betaine:CoA ligase CaiC from Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, and
Arcobacter marinus were screened and shown to be functionally active CaiC
variants. These variants and the developed biosensor may be valuable for
improving l-carnitine production processes.
