Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the skin
associated with specific lesional dysbiotic features. We studied the microbiome
of clinically unaffected typical HS sites (armpits, inguinal folds, and gluteal
clefts) in 60 patients with HS and 17 healthy controls. A total of 192 samples
obtained by swabbing were analyzed by bacterial cultures. Of these, 116 randomly 
selected samples were studied by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Patients and 
controls showed similar characteristics, except for smoking (87% vs. 6%,
respectively). HS skinfolds were characterized by an increased abundance of
anaerobes, predominantly Prevotella, but also Actinomyces, Campylobacter
ureolyticus, and Mobiluncus, contrasting with a lower abundance of skin
commensals such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, a major component of the skin
microbiome; Kocuria; and Micrococcus luteus. The following three independent
factors were associated with an abundance of high anaerobes by multivariate
analysis: samples originating from patients with HS patients (P = 2.1 × 10-4);
body mass index (P = 5 × 10-5); and the sampling site, the gluteal cleft being
the most anaerobic area, followed by inguinal folds and axilla (P = 3 × 10-6).
The microbiome of clinically unaffected HS skinfolds is reminiscent, albeit to a 
minor extent, of the microbiome of chronic suppurative HS lesions and may fuel
inflammation at a preclinical stage of the disease.
