Achyrocline flaccida (Weinm) DC. essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation 
of wild flowers from southern Brazil. We explored, for the first time, the
phytochemical composition, toxicity, resistance to oxidative stress in
Caenorhabditis elegans, and antimycobacterial activities of A. flaccida essential
oil. Twenty-four compounds were identified by GC-FID-MS and the major
constituents identified were α-pinene (41.10%) and caryophyllene (30.52%). The
essential oil showed no signs of genotoxicity in the comet assay and presented
relevant antioxidant capacity since it prevented ROS production in the C. elegans
model. Furthermore, the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) results showed
that M. abscessus, M. massiliense, and M. fortuitum had their growth inhibited by
A. flaccida essential oil. Therefore, the essential oil of this plant is a
promising alternative in the search for new compounds capable of decreasing
oxidative stress and treating mycobacteriosis.
