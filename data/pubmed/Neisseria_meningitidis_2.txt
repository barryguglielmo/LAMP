Acute infectious purpura fulminans is a serious, potentially fatal condition. We 
present a case series of 11 patients from March 2005 to March 2017, whose
clinical symptoms were fever (100%), confusion (63.6%) and headache (55%), and
whose common laboratory abnormalities were thrombocytopenia (100%), elevated
alkaline phosphatase (70%) and anaemia (63.6%). Three patients (27%) developed
gangrene and two presented in shock. Only one grew Neisseria meningitidis in
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture and another confirmed by latex agglutination
and polymerase chain reaction in CSF. Five others had serology confirmed spotted 
fever rickettsioses (SFG). All received broad spectrum antibiotics; in 9/11
patients, this included doxycycline or azithromycin. The mean hospital stay was
10.2 days and overall mortality was 18.2%.
