DNA replication forks often encounter template DNA lesions that can stall their
progression. The PriA-dependent pathway is the major replication restart
mechanism in Gram-positive bacteria, and it requires several primosome proteins. 
Among them, PriA protein-a 3' to 5' superfamily-2 DNA helicase-is the key factor 
in recognizing DNA lesions and it also recruits other proteins. Here, we
investigated the ATPase and helicase activities of Streptococcus pneumoniae PriA 
(SpPriA) through biochemical and kinetic analyses. By comparing various DNA
substrates, we observed that SpPriA is unable to unwind duplex DNA with high GC
content. We constructed a deletion mutant protein (SpPriAdeloop) from which the
loop area of the DNA-binding domain of PriA had been removed. Functional assays
on SpPriAdeloop revealed that the loop area is important in endowing DNA-binding 
properties on the helicase. We also show that presence of DnaD loader protein is 
important for enhancing SpPriA ATPase and DNA unwinding activities.
