The marine microbiome is a complex and least-understood habitat, which play a
significant role in global biogeochemical cycles. The present study reported the 
culture-independent assessment of microbial diversity from the Arabian Sea (AS)
sediments (from Gujarat to Malabar; at 30 m depth) by using metagenome sequence
analysis. Our results elucidated that bacterial communities in the Malabar
coastal region are highly diverse than the Gujarat coast. Moreover, Statistical
analysis (Spearman rank correlation) showed a significant correlation
co-efficient value (r = P < 0.001) between microbial communities and
physicochemical parameters (salinity and dissolved oxygen) in the water column. A
total of 39 bacterial phyla were recorded from the eastern side of AS, of which
six phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria,
Firmicutes, and Planctomycetes were found to be the most dominant group. The most
dominant genus from Valapad region (Malabar Coast) was found to be Halomonas sp.,
while other regions were dominated with Psychrobacter pulmonis. The subsequent
Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) showed 99.53% variance, which suggests that,
highly distinct microbial communities at Valapad (Malabar Coast) sampling
location than other sites. Moreover, the microbial metabolic activity analysis
revealed the important functions of microbial communities in the AS are
hydrocarbon degradation, polymer degradation, nutrient oxidation and sulphate
reduction (biodegradation process). Further extended studies are needed to be
carried out for better understanding the functional diversity of microbial
communities from the marine sediments.
