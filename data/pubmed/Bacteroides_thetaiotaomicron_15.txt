Loss of diversity in the gut microbiome can persist for extended periods after
antibiotic treatment, impacting microbiome function, antimicrobial resistance and
probably host health. Despite widespread antibiotic use, our understanding of the
species and metabolic functions contributing to gut microbiome recovery is
limited. Using data from 4 discovery cohorts in 3 continents comprising >500
microbiome profiles from 117 individuals, we identified 21 bacterial species
exhibiting robust association with ecological recovery post antibiotic therapy.
Functional and growth-rate analysis showed that recovery is supported by
enrichment in specific carbohydrate-degradation and energy-production pathways.
Association rule mining on 782 microbiome profiles from the MEDUSA database
enabled reconstruction of the gut microbial 'food web', identifying many
recovery-associated bacteria as keystone species, with the ability to use host-
and diet-derived energy sources, and support repopulation of other gut species.
Experiments in a mouse model recapitulated the ability of recovery-associated
bacteria (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Bifidobacterium adolescentis) to
promote recovery with synergistic effects, providing a boost of two orders of
magnitude to microbial abundance in early time points and faster maturation of
microbial diversity. The identification of specific species and metabolic
functions promoting recovery opens up opportunities for rationally determining
pre- and probiotic formulations offering protection from long-term consequences
of frequent antibiotic usage.
