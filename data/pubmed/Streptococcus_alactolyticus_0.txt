In this study, we aimed to investigate the ileum digesta of a large cohort of
Japanese quail fed the same diet, with similar environmental conditions. We also 
address how P utilization (PU), Ca utilization (CaU), and bird performance (feed 
intake (FI), feed conversion (FC), and body weight gain (BWG)) modify intestinal 
microbiota of male and female quail. Despite the great number of samples analyzed
(760), a core microbiome was composed of five bacteria. The Unc. Lactobacillus,
Unc. Clostridaceae 1, Clostridium sensu stricto, Escherichia coli, and
Streptococcus alactolyticus were detected in all samples and contributed to more 
than 70% of the total community. Depending on the bird predisposition for PU,
CaU, FI, BWG, and FC, those species were present in higher or lower abundances.
There was a significant gender effect on the ileal microbial community. While
females had higher abundances of Lactobacillus, males were more colonized by
Streptococcus alactolyticus. The entire cohort was highly colonized by
Escherichia coli (8%-15%), an enteropathogenic bacteria. It remains unclear, if
microbiota composition followed the mechanisms that caused different PU, CaU, FI,
FC, and BWG or if the change in microbiota composition and function caused the
differences in PU, CaU, and performance traits.
