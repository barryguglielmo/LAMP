The taxonomic classification of Pseudomonas species has been revised and updated 
several times. This study utilized average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital 
DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) cutoff values of 95 and 70â€Š%, respectively, to
re-identify the species of strains deposited in GenBank as P. aeruginosa, P.
fluorescens and P. putida. Of the 264 deposited P. aeruginosa strains, 259 were
correctly identified as P. aeruginosa, but the remaining five were not. All 28
deposited P. fluorescens strains had been incorrectly identified as P.
fluorescens. Four of these strains were re-identified, including two as P.
kilonensis and one each as P. aeruginosa and P. brassicacearum, but the remaining
24 could not be re-identified. Similarly, all 35 deposited P. putida strains had 
been incorrectly identified as P. putida. Nineteen of these strains were
re-identified, including 12 as P. alloputida, four as P. asiatica and one each as
P. juntendi, P. monteilii and P. mosselii. These results strongly suggest that
Pseudomonas bacteria should be identified using ANI and dDDH analyses based on
whole genome sequencing when Pseudomonas species are initially deposited in
GenBank/DDBJ/EMBL databases.
