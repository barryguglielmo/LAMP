Background: Controlling cariogenic biofilm formation by plant extracts could add 
to preventive strategies to dental caries.
Objective: To evaluate in vitro the role of Aerva Sanguinolenta ethanolic extract
on biofilm-induced microbial human enamel demineralization.
Methodology: The prepared enamel sections of study group (SG), positive control
group (PCG), and negative control group (NCG) were immersed in 2 ml of 0.2%
ethanolic extract of A. sanguinolenta, 0.12% chlorhexidine, and distilled water, 
respectively, for 2 min before subjecting to closed batch culture technique
utilizing mono- or dual-species culture media of Streptococcus mutans and
Lactobacillus acidophilus. Quantification of biofilm and demineralization of
enamel was performed by crystal violet (CV) assay and scanning electron
microscope (SEM) attached to energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, respectively.
Statistical Analysis: Two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test were used for analysis.
Results: CV assay of biofilm recorded the highest and lowest optical absorbance
value in NC3 (2.728660) and PC3 (0.364200), respectively. Thus, biofilm formation
is highest in NCG and lowest among PCG. Surface roughness and porosity in enamel 
are greatest among NCG and lowest among SG as evident by SEM. Wt% of calcium (S3 
47.7170) and phosphorus ion (S3 22.7330) was highest in SG, closely resembling
that of B enamel (Ca = 41.9530, P = 19.6650). Wt% of oxygen is lowest in SG (S3
28.8920) and resembles baseline O2 (37.4950). Thus, the amount of biofilm
formation is moderate and amount of demineralization of enamel is least among
SGs.
Conclusion: Enamel exposed to 2 ml of 0.2% solution of A. sanguinolenta for 2 min
could fairly inhibit formation of biofilm and positively inhibit underlying
demineralization in cariogenic environment.
