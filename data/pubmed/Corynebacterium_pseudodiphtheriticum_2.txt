Antimicrobial resistance is one of the most important public health issues.
Besides classical multidrug resistance species associated with medical care
involved in superficial or invasive infections, there are strains less commonly
associated with hospital or outpatient setting's infections. Non-diphtheria
Corynebacterium spp. could produce infections in patients with or without
immune-compromised status. The aim of our study was to determine the
susceptibility to antimicrobial agents to Corynebacterium spp. from clinical
samples collected from Romanian hospitalized individuals and outpatients. Twenty 
Corynebacterium strains were isolated and identified as Corynebacterium striatum 
(n = 7), Corynebacterium amycolatum (n = 7), C. urealyticum (n = 3),
Corynebacterium afermentans (n = 2), and Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum (n 
= 1). All isolates have been tested for antibiotic susceptibility by standardized
disc diffusion method and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) tests. Seventeen
isolates demonstrated multidrug resistance phenotypes. The molecular support
responsible for high resistance to quinolones for ten of these strains was
determined by the detection of point mutation in the gene sequence gyrA.
