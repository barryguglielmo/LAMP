Daphnia has been widely used as an indicator species in aquatic biomonitoring for
decades. Traditional toxicity assays based on lethality take a long time to
assess, and the effect mode of contaminants is not clear. Because of the
translucency of the Daphnia body and the application of fluorescent probes in
cell staining, different intoxicated parts can be visualized. In this study, a
double-staining method using two fluorescent dyes, Calcein AM (cell-permeant dye)
and Propidium Iodide (cell-impermeant dye), was carried out on Daphnia magna
exposed to six pathogens: Salmonella spp. (four strains) and Shigella spp. (two
strains). The results showed that those bacteria caused different infections on
daphnia depending on the age of this organism and bacterial concentrations. In
detail, S. dublin and S. sonnei are the most harmful to Daphnia when they cause
damage at smaller concentrations at the younger stage (3 weeks old).
Interestingly, older Daphnia can give responses to nearly 10 CFU/ml to less than 
100 CFU/ml of some bacteria strains. In another experiment, S. sonnei disturbed
Daphnia after just 10 min of exposure, and Daphnia adapted to S. choleraesuis, S.
typhi, and S. flexneri at the early stage (3 weeks old) after 1 h of exposure.
Moreover, the damaged areas of the daphnia body were directly observed via a
microscope, contributing to the understanding and the prediction of toxicity
mechanisms.
