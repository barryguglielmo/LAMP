Fermented camel milk possesses a weak (liquid-like) gel structure. We aimed to 1)
investigate the characteristics, bioactivities and rheological properties of the 
exopolysaccharide (EPS) produced by Lactococcus garvieae-C47
(exopolysaccharide-C47 product), a potential probiotic bacterium, on milk
extracted from camels and 2) examine the rheological properties of the fermented 
camel milk produced by L. garvieae-C47. Exopolysaccharide-C47 product (molecular 
weight: 7.3 × 106 Da) was composed of the following monosaccharides: glucose
(82.51%), arabinose (5.32%) and xylose (12.17%). The antioxidant, antitumor and
α-amylase inhibitory activities of exopolysaccharide-C47 product reached up to
67.52, 59.35 and 91.0%, respectively. The apparent viscosity of
exopolysaccharide-C47 product decreased with the increase in shear rate and
declined by increasing the temperature up to 50 °C. The rheological properties of
exopolysaccharide-C47 product are influenced by the salt type and pH value. The
exopolysaccharide product produced by L. garvieae C47 possesses valuable health
benefits and has the ability to improve the weak structure of fermented camel
milk.
