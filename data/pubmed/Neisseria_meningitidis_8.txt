Bacterial meningitis (BM) is a severe disease caused by various bacterial
pathogens. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) protect humans from invading pathogens. In 
this study, we determined whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TLR4 
and TLR9 are associated with susceptibility to and outcome of BM in Angolan
children. Samples were taken from 241 patients and 265 age-matched ethnic
controls. The SNPs TLR4 rs4986790 (896A > G) and TLR9 rs187084 (-1486T > C) were 
determined by high-resolution melting analysis (HRMA). The frequency of variant
genotypes in TLR4 was significantly higher in patients with Haemophilus
influenzae meningitis than controls (odds ratio (OR), 2.5; 95% confidence
interval (CI), 1.2-5.4; p = 0.021), whereas the frequency of variant genotypes in
TLR9 was significantly lower in patients with H. influenzae meningitis than
controls (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.9; p = 0.036). No such differences were found
with other causative pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria
meningitidis. At the time of discharge, patients with meningitis caused by
Gram-negative bacteria who were carriers of variant TLR4 genotypes had a higher
risk of ataxia (OR, 12.91; 95% CI, 1.52-109.80; p = 0.019) and other neurological
sequelae (OR, 11.85; 95% CI, 1.07-131.49; p = 0.044) than those with the
wild-type TLR4 genotype. Our study suggests an association between H. influenzae 
meningitis and genetic variation between TLR4 and TLR9 in Angolan children.
