INTRODUCTION: Clinical and bacteriological features of cobra (Naja) bites are
still relatively unknown in Vietnam. This study aimed to characterize the
clinical and bacteriological characteristics of local wounds in patients with
presumed Naja spp bite, as well as their antibiotic treatment.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed on presumed Naja bite patients who
were admitted to Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam. In vitro bacterial
isolation, blood tests, and lesion measure were conducted, and antibiotic
susceptibilities of localized bite wounds were assessed. The Mann-Whitney test
was used to examine the difference in clinical characteristics between patients
experiencing presumed Naja atra bites and Naja kaouthia bites. Data are presented
as percentages or median with interquartile range, as appropriate. Statistical
significance was accepted at P<0.05.
RESULTS: Among 46 patients, all had typical clinical features of Naja bite. The
median bite-to-hospital time was 6 h (interquartile range 4.0-11.3). The dominant
organisms isolated from local wounds were Morganella morganii (11/36) and
Enterococcus faecalis (25/36). All cultures were susceptible to ciprofloxacin. No
difference was found with regard to pain, swelling circumference, swelling
spread, or necrotic area between patients bitten by presumed Naja atra and Naja
kaouthia (P>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Wound necrosis and infection were important clinical issues in
presumed Naja spp snake bites. Morganella morganii and Enterococcus faecalis were
dominant in local wound swabs of such cases. Ciprofloxacin should be an effective
first-line antibiotic for patients with presumed Naja bite.
