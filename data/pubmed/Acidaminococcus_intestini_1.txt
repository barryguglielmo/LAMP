Imaging dense and diverse microbial communities has broad applications in basic
microbiology and medicine, but remains a grand challenge due to the fact that
many species adopt similar morphologies. While prior studies have relied on
techniques involving spectral labeling, we have developed an expansion microscopy
method (μExM) in which bacterial cells are physically expanded prior to imaging. 
We find that expansion patterns depend on the structural and mechanical
properties of the cell wall, which vary across species and conditions. We use
this phenomenon as a quantitative and sensitive phenotypic imaging contrast
orthogonal to spectral separation to resolve bacterial cells of different species
or in distinct physiological states. Focusing on host-microbe interactions that
are difficult to quantify through fluorescence alone, we demonstrate the ability 
of μExM to distinguish species through an in vitro defined community of human gut
commensals and in vivo imaging of a model gut microbiota, and to sensitively
detect cell-envelope damage caused by antibiotics or previously unrecognized
cell-to-cell phenotypic heterogeneity among pathogenic bacteria as they infect
macrophages.
