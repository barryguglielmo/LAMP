Background & Objective: Vibrio cholerae is a natural inhabitant of the
environment and causes severe diarrhea ailments (cholera) that affects thousands 
of people each year worldwide. The most important virulence factors of this
pathogen are cholera toxin (cholera toxin CT) and Type IV pili (toxin
co-regulated pili TCP), which are encoded within the genome of the filamentous
bacteriophage CTXÏ†. In the present study, according to researchers' report on
genotypic variations of cholera toxin, we evaluated the sequence of ctxB subunit 
obtained from 100 strains of patients infected with cholera in Iran.
Methods: The evaluation of genotype variations of cholera toxin was made by
high-resolution melting curve analysis illustrating a single nucleotide change.
Then, ctxB gene sequencing was performed. Through this analysis and the
sequencing process, two standard samples were studied.
Results: Using serologic tests, all the strains analyzed in this study were
identified to be in O1 serotype. However, there have been differences in
sequences of ctxB as some were similar to V . cholerae O1 biovar El Tor str.
N16961 while others were similar to the genotype of V . cholerae ATCC 14035. We
did not observe any particular pattern within the process of mutation.
Conclusion: The analysis of the new samples of ctxB showed that they were
potentially different. It seems that these complicated species were affected by a
new genetic exchange of El Tor and classic genotypes.
