Corynebacterium species, other than Corynebacterium diphteriae, are usually
dismissed as contaminants when recovered from patient's samples. It is often
difficult to decide whether these bacteria have clinical relevance or not. The
Corynebacterium genus has been implicated in a wide variety of human infections. 
In this brief report, two cases of mastitis caused by Corynebacterium
pyruviciproducens and Corynebacterium amycolatum are described in not
breastfeeding women. These patients were immunocompetent with no evidence of
ongoing risk factors for mastitis. This report seeks to give importance to this
genus by always ranking cultures, starting with a thorough sample collection up
until a complete evaluation of lab results and clinical presentation.
