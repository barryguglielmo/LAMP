An obligately anaerobic, Gram-stain-positive and coccus-shaped bacterium,
designated strain YH-panp20T, was isolated from pig faeces. Phylogenetic analysis
based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated that the isolate belongs to the
family Erysipelotrichaceae, and is most closely related to Catenisphaera
adipataccumulans KCTC 15517T (93.5 % sequence similarity), followed by
Faecalitalea cylindroides KCTC 5815T (92.2 %), Faecalicoccus acidiformans KCTC
15521T (90.2 %) and Holdemanella biformis KCTC 5969T (89.6 %). Average nucleotide
identity values between YH-panp20T and its closest relatives were lower than
71 %. The G+C content of the isolate was 38.4 mol%, and its cell-wall
peptidoglycan was found to be of A1γ type and contained meso-diaminopimelic acid.
The predominant fatty acids were C18 : 1 cis 9, C18 : 0 DMA and C16 : 0. The
major end-products of glucose fermentation were lactate, acetate and formate.
Therefore, based on the phenotypic, phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic properties, a
novel genus and species, Absicoccus porci gen. nov., sp. nov., is proposed for
isolate YH-panp20T (=KCTC 15747T=JCM 32769T).
