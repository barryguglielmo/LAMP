α-Glucans that were enzymatically synthesized from sucrose using glucansucrase
cloned from Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-1118 were found to have a glass
transition temperature of approximately 80 °C. Using high-pressure homogenization
(~70 MPa), the α-glucans were converted into nanoparticles of ~120 nm in diameter
with a surface potential of ~-3 mV. Fluorescence measurements using
1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) indicate that the α-glucan nanoparticles have
a hydrophobic core that remains intact from 10 to 85 °C. α-Glucan nanoparticles
were found to be stable for over 220 days and able to form at three pH levels.
Accelerated exposure measurements demonstrated that the α-glucan nanoparticles
can endure exposure to elevated temperatures up to 60 °C for 6 h intervals.
