Maternal milk is an important source of essential nutrients for the optimal
growth of infants. Breastfeeding provides a continuous supply of beneficial
bacteria to colonize the infant gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and offers health
benefits for disease prevention and immunity. The purpose of this study was to
isolate novel probiotic strains from the breast milk of native Pakistani mothers 
and to evaluate their probiotic potential. We isolated 21 strains of bacteria
from the colostrum and mature milk of 20 healthy mothers, who had vaginal
deliveries and were not taking antibiotics. After phenotypic and genotypic
characterization, these isolates were tested for survival in the GIT using in
vitro acid and bile tests. Nine strains showing good acid tolerance were assessed
for their growth rate, bile resistance and ability to hydrolyze bile salts. Out
of the four Lactobacillus isolates adjudged to be most promising as probiotics,
three were Lactobacillus fermentum strains and one was a strain of Lactobacillus 
oris. This study demonstrates that human milk is a viable source of commensal
bacteria beneficial to both adults and babies.
