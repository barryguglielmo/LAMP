Histamine, one of the most toxic and commonly encountered biogenic amines (BA) in
food, is produced by the microbial decarboxylation of histidine. It may
accumulate at high concentrations in fish and fermented food. Cheese has some of 
the highest histamine concentrations, the result of the histidine-decarboxylase
activity of certain lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The present work describes the
nucleotide sequence and transcriptional organization of the gene cluster
responsible for histamine biosynthesis (the HDC cluster) in Lactobacillus
vaginalis IPLA 11064 isolated from cheese. The influence of histidine
availability and pH on histamine production and the expression of the HDC cluster
genes is also examined. As expected, the results suggest that the production of
histamine under acidic conditions improves cell survival by maintaining the
cytosol at an appropriate pH. However, the transcriptional regulation of the HDC 
cluster is quite different from that described in other dairy histamine-producing
LAB, probably due to the lack of a termination-antitermination system in the
histidyl-tRNA synthetase gene (hisS).
