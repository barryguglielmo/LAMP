Oligosaccharides from human or bovine milk selectively stimulate growth or
metabolism of bacteria associated with the lower gastrointestinal tract of
infants. Results from complex infant-type co-cultures point toward a possible
synergistic effect of combining bovine milk oligosaccharides (BMO) and lactose
(LAC) on enhancing the metabolism of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum and
inhibition of Clostridium perfringens. We examine the interaction between B.
longum subsp. longum and the commensal Parabacteroides distasonis, by culturing
them in mono- and co-culture with different carbohydrates available. To
understand the interaction between BMO and lactose on B. longum subsp. longum and
test the potential postbiotic effect on C. perfringens growth and/or metabolic
activity, we inoculated C. perfringens into fresh media and compared the
metabolic changes to C. perfringens in cell-free supernatant from B. longum
subsp. longum fermented media. In co-culture, B. longum subsp. longum benefits
from P. distasonis (commensalism), especially in a lactose-rich environment.
Furthermore, B. longum subsp. longum fermentation of BMO + LAC impaired C.
perfringens' ability to utilize BMO as a carbon source (potential postbiotic
effect).
