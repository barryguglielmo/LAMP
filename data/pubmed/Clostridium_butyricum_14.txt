With the aggravation of environmental pollution and energy crisis, the
sustainable microbial fermentation process of converting glycerol to
1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) has become an attractive alternative. However, the
difficulty in the online measurement of glycerol and 1,3-PDO creates a barrier to
the fermentation process and then leads to the residual glycerol and therefore,
its wastage. Thus, in the present study, the four-input artificial neural network
(ANN) model was developed successfully to predict the concentration of glycerol, 
1,3-PDO, and biomass with high accuracy. Moreover, an ANN model combined with a
kinetic model was also successfully developed to simulate the fed-batch
fermentation process accurately. Hence, a soft sensor from the ANN model based on
NaOH-related parameters has been successfully developed which cannot only be
applied in software to solve the difficulty of glycerol and 1,3-PDO online
measurement during the industrialization process, but also offer insight and
reference for similar fermentation processes.
