The interplay of the gut microbes with gut-producing nephrotoxins and the renal
progression remains unclear in large human cohort. Significant compositional and 
functional differences in the intestinal microbiota (by 16S rRNA gene sequencing)
were noted among 30 controls and 92 (31 mild, 30 moderate and 31 advanced)
patients at different chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages (discovery cohort). A
core CKD-associated microbiota consisted of 7 genera (Escherichia_Shigella,
Dialister, Lachnospiraceae_ND3007_group, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Roseburia,
Paraprevotella and Ruminiclostridium) and 2 species (Collinsella stercoris and
Bacteroides eggerthii) were identified to be highly correlated with the stages of
CKD. Paraprevotella, Pseudobutyrivibrio and Collinsella stercoris were superior
in discriminating CKD from the controls than the use of urine protein/creatinine 
ratio, even at early-stage of disease. The performance was further confirmed in a
validation cohort comprising 22 controls and 76 peritoneal dialysis patients.
Bacterial genera highly correlated with indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate
levels were identified. Prediction of the functional capabilities of microbial
communities showed that microbial genes related to the metabolism of aromatic
amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan) were differentially
enriched among the control and different CKD stages. Collectively, our results
provide solid human evidence of the impact of gut-metabolite-kidney axis on the
severity of chronic kidney disease and highlight a usefulness of specific gut
microorganisms as possible disease differentiate marker of this global health
burden.
