BACKGROUND: Sea buckthorn is a good and possible source of a wide range of
bioactive compounds with     a positive effect on the human body, especially
polyphenols and carotenoids.
METHODS: The present study aimed to evaluate the antioxidant and antimicrobial
activities of Hippophae rhamnoides L. products - 100% oil, 100% juice, dry
berries, and tea (dry berries, leaves, and twigs). The antioxidant activity was
determined by DPPH radical scavenging and molybdenum reducing antioxidant power
methods. The content of phytochemicals (polyphenols, flavonoids, carotenoids) was
measured by colorimetric methods. The detection of antimicrobial activity was
carried out using the disc diffusion method and an evaluation of minimal
inhibition concentration against three species of Gram-negative bacteria:
Escherichia coli CCM 3988, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica CCM 3807, Yersinia
enterocolitica CCM 5671, and three Gram-positive bacteria: Bacillus thuringiensis
CCM 19, Listeria monocytogenes CCM 4699, Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus CCM 
2461.
RESULTS: All the tested sea buckthorn products had a high antioxidant activity.
The highest content of total polyphenols (204.26 mg GAE/g), flavonoids (30.00 mg 
QE/g), and carotenoids (0.34 mg/g) were identified in 100% sea buckthorn juice.
Maximal values of the antioxidant activity were found using the DPPH method for
100% oil (8.75 mg TE/g) and molybdenum reducing power for tea (196.41 mg TE/g).
All the tested products showed strong antimicrobial activity against the tested
bacteria, confirmed by both methods - disc diffusion (especially for Yersinia
enterocolitica CCM 5671) and minimal inhibitory concentration.
CONCLUSIONS: The pronounced antioxidant and antibacterial properties of sea
buckthorn products indicate the importance of sea buckthorn application in health
promotion and agricultural practice.
