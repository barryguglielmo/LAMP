The combination of isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol is recommended by the
American Thoracic Society (ATS) for treatment of pulmonary Mycobacterium
kansasii, while the British Thoracic Society (BTS) recommends clarithromycin,
rifampin and ethambutol. Unfortunately, therapy duration for both regimens lasts 
for years. In this study, we administered tedizolid, minocycline, clarithromycin,
and rifapentine as monotherapy as well as novel combinations in the intracellular
hollow-fiber model system of M. kansasii (HFS-Mkn) in a 28-day study. The ATS and
BTS regimens were used as comparators. Repetitive sampling was used to validate
the intended intrapulmonary pharmacokinetics of each drug and to monitor changes 
in M. kansasii burden. As monotherapy, tedizolid at an observed area under the
concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC0-24)/MIC of 5.85 and minocycline at 
an AUC0-24/MIC of 5.77 failed to kill the bacteria below day 0 (stasis),
clarithromycin at an AUC0-24/MIC of 2.4 held the bacterial burden at stasis, but 
rifapentine at an AUC0-24/MIC of 140 killed 2 log10 CFU/ml below stasis. The BTS 
regimen kill slope was -0.083 ± 0.035 CFU/ml/day, which was significantly
superior to the ATS regimen slope of -0.038 ± 0.038 CFU/ml/day. The
rifapentine-tedizolid-minocycline combination kill slope was -0.119 ± 0.031
CFU/ml/day, superior to that of the ATS regimen and comparable to that of the BTS
regimen. In conclusion, the BTS regimen and the novel
rifapentine-tedizolid-minocycline regimen showed better kill of intracellular
bacteria in the HFS-Mkn However, the efficacy of the new combination regimen
remains to be tested in clinical settings.
