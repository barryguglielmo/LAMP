A patient with a prosthetic joint infection (PJI) complicated with deep surgical 
site infection due to vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis. The initial
treatment consisted of 10 days with daptomycin plus ampicillin. The hip
prosthesis was retained and salvaged with six outpatient sequential doses of
oritavancin 1200 mg every seven days without intra-articular irrigation or other 
surgical interventions. The patient was ambulating independently without symptoms
after ten months of the last treatment of oritavancin.
