Plasma trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is associated with coronary atherosclerotic 
plaque and cardiovascular disease risk, but associations between gut microbes in 
acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and post-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction
(post-STEMI) events are unknown. We investigated associations between gut
microbial taxa and systemic TMAO levels and the possible TMAO contribution to
incident post-STEMI cardiovascular events.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 60
patients, including 30 with unstable angina pectoris (UAP), 30 post-STEMI and 30 
healthy controls, were enrolled from June to November 2017. Metagenomic
sequencing was performed and TMAO and IL-6 were detected.
RESULTS: Minimal discriminators of gut microbial taxa (top 40) distinguished ACS 
patients from controls. Serum TMAO levels were positively associated with
increased abundance of Aerococcaceae, Ruminococcaceae_UCG.005,
Ruminococcaceae_UCC.014 and X. Eubacterium_fissicatena, and decreased abundance
of Lachnospiraceae_FCS020 (P < 0.05). Elevated serum TMAO levels correlated
independently with ACS (P < 0.05). Risk stratification for incident major adverse
cardiovascular events (MACE) improved at one year in patients with serum TMAO
levels ≦2.19 µM. Serum interleukin-6 levels were not significantly increased in
patients with ACS and post-STEMI MACE.
CONCLUSIONS: ACS and incident post-STEMI MACE may be associated with the gut
bacteria choline metabolite TMAO. The specific gut microbial taxa identified in
association with serum TMAO levels may be potential predictive biomarkers for
accurate diagnosis of ACS onset.
