The human gastrointestinal microbiome contains commensal bacteria and other
microbiota that have been gaining increasing attention in the context of cancer
development and response to treatment. Microbiota play a role in the maintenance 
of host barrier surfaces that contribute to both local inflammation and other
systemic metabolic functions. In the context of prostate cancer, the
gastrointestinal microbiome may play a role through metabolism of estrogen, an
increase of which has been linked to the induction of prostatic neoplasia.
Specific microbiota such as Bacteroides, Streptococcus, Bacteroides massiliensis,
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Eubacterium rectalie, and Mycoplasma genitalium
have been associated with differing risks of prostate cancer development or
extensiveness of prostate cancer disease. In this Review, we discuss
gastrointestinal microbiota's effects on prostate cancer development, the ability
of the microbiome to regulate chemotherapy for prostate cancer treatment, and the
importance of using Next Generation Sequencing to further discern the
microbiome's systemic influence on prostate cancer.
