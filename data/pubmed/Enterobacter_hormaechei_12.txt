Abstract: This study describes the first full genomic sequence of an mcr-9 and
blaVIM-4-carrying multidrug-resistant Enterobacter hormaechei clinical isolate
from Egypt. The strain was isolated in April 2015 from the sputum of a patient in
Cairo, Egypt. The mcr-9 and blaVIM-4 genes were identified by PCR screening and
DNA sequencing; the isolate was subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility
testing, conjugation experiments, and whole genomic sequencing. mcr-9 and
blaVIM-4 were carried by an IncHI2 plasmid, pAMS-38a (281,121 bp in size); the
plasmid also carried genes conferring resistance against sulfonamides (sul1),
quinolones (qnrA1), trimethoprim (dfrA1), β-lactams (blaTEM-1B), aminoglycosides 
(aac (6')-II, aadA23, aadA2b, and ant(2'')-Ia). The strain was susceptible to
colistin (MIC, <0.25 μg/mL); this could be due to the absence of the qseC/qseB
regulatory system located downstream of mcr-9 in Enterobacterales, which is
involved in the induction of colistin-resistance. The genetic context of mcr-9
and blaVIM-4 was identified as IS1-mcr-9-IS903-pcoS-∆pcoE-rcnA and
intI1-blaVIM-4-aac (6')-II-dfrA1-∆aadA23-smr-ISPa21-qacE∆1, respectively. This is
the first report of an mcr-9 and blaVIM-4 /IncHI2-carrying multidrug-resistant E.
hormaechei clinical isolate from Africa and the Middle East. Plasmids of the
IncHI2 group and the two insertion sequences (IS1, and IS903) might be the main
vehicles for dissemination of mcr-9. Further screening for mcr-9 is essential for
identifying its incidence and to prevent its dissemination.
