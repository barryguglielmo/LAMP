OBJECTIVE: This study investigated a method of preparing corn stover for Irpex
lacteus (I. lacteus) treatment to improve its in vitro rumen degradability under 
non-sterile conditions.
METHODS: Corn stover was inoculated with Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum), 
Lactobacillus buchneri (L. buchneri), and an equal mixture of these strains, and 
ensiled for 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days. After each period, a portion of the silage 
was sampled to assess the silage quality, and another portion of the silage was
further treated with I. lacteus at 28Â°C for 28 d. All the samples were analyzed
for fermentation quality, chemical composition, and in vitro gas production
(IVGP) as a measure of rumen fermentation capacity.
RESULTS: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) was found to improve the silage quality of
the corn stover, and the corn stover silage inoculated with L. plantarum produced
more lactic acid and higher IVGP than other silage groups. The I. lacteus
colonies flourished in the early stage of corn stover silage, especially on the
3-d corn stover silage inoculated with both L. plantarum and L. buchneri. This
led to an 18% decrease in the acid detergent lignin content, and a 49.6% increase
in IVGP compared with the raw stover.
CONCLUSION: The combination of ensiling with the mixed LAB inoculation and I.
lacteus treatment provided a cost-effective method for the improvement of the
IVGP of corn stover from 164.8 mL/g organic matter (OM) to 246.6 mL/g OM.
