BACKGROUND: In recent years, the microbiome field has undergone a shift from
clustering-based methods of operational taxonomic unit (OTU) designation based on
sequence similarity to denoising algorithms that identify exact amplicon sequence
variants (ASVs), and methods to identify contaminating bacterial DNA sequences
from low biomass samples have been developed. Although these methods improve
accuracy when analyzing mock communities, their impact on real samples and
downstream analysis of biological associations is less clear.
RESULTS: Here, we re-processed our recently published milk microbiota data using 
Qiime1 to identify OTUs, and Qiime2 to identify ASVs, with or without contaminant
removal using decontam. Qiime2 resolved the mock community more accurately,
primarily because Qiime1 failed to detect Lactobacillus. Qiime2 also considerably
reduced the average number of ASVs detected in human milk samples (364 ± 145 OTUs
vs. 170 ± 73 ASVs, p < 0.001). Compared to the richness, the estimated diversity 
measures had a similar range using both methods albeit statistically different
(inverse Simpson index: 14.3 ± 8.5 vs. 15.6 ± 8.7, p = 0.031) and there was
strong consistency and agreement for the relative abundances of the most abundant
bacterial taxa, including Staphylococcaceae and Streptococcaceae. One notable
exception was Oxalobacteriaceae, which was overrepresented using Qiime1
regardless of contaminant removal. Downstream statistical analyses were not
impacted by the choice of algorithm in terms of the direction, strength, and
significance of associations of host factors with bacterial diversity and overall
community composition.
CONCLUSION: Overall, the biological observations and conclusions were robust to
the choice of the sequencing processing methods and contaminant removal.
