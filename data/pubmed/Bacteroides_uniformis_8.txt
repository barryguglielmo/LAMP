Proteins carry out the vast majority of functions in all biological domains, but 
for technological reasons their large-scale investigation has lagged behind the
study of genomes. Since the first essentially complete eukaryotic proteome was
reported1, advances in mass-spectrometry-based proteomics2 have enabled
increasingly comprehensive identification and quantification of the human
proteome3-6. However, there have been few comparisons across species7,8, in stark
contrast with genomics initiatives9. Here we use an advanced proteomics
workflow-in which the peptide separation step is performed by a microstructured
and extremely reproducible chromatographic system-for the in-depth study of 100
taxonomically diverse organisms. With two million peptide and 340,000 stringent
protein identifications obtained in a standardized manner, we double the number
of proteins with solid experimental evidence known to the scientific community.
The data also provide a large-scale case study for sequence-based machine
learning, as we demonstrate by experimentally confirming the predicted properties
of peptides from Bacteroides uniformis. Our results offer a comparative view of
the functional organization of organisms across the entire evolutionary range. A 
remarkably high fraction of the total proteome mass in all kingdoms is dedicated 
to protein homeostasis and folding, highlighting the biological challenge of
maintaining protein structure in all branches of life. Likewise, a universally
high fraction is involved in supplying energy resources, although these pathways 
range from photosynthesis through iron sulfur metabolism to carbohydrate
metabolism. Generally, however, proteins and proteomes are remarkably diverse
between organisms, and they can readily be explored and functionally compared at
