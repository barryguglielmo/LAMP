A probiotic and prebiotic food ingredient combination was tested for synergistic 
functioning in modulation of the colonic microbiome and remediation of the
gastrointestinal immune and inflammatory responses in a spontaneous colitic mouse
model. Bacillus coagulans MTCC5856 spores with capability to metabolise complex
plant polysaccharides were supplemented with complex whole-plant prebiotic
sugarcane fibre (PSCF). The combined and individual efficacies were tested for
their influence on the outcomes of chronic inflammation in Muc2 mutant colitic
Winnie mice. The mice were fed normal chow diet supplemented with either
ingredient or a combination for 21 days. Synbiotic combined supplementation
ameliorated clinical symptoms and histological colonic damage scores more
effectively than either B. coagulans or PSCF alone. PSCF and B. coagulans alone
also induced considerable immunomodulatory effects. Synbiotic supplementation
however was the most efficacious in modulating the overall immune profile
compared to the unsupplemented Winnie-control. The augmented synbiotic effect
could potentially be due to a combination of increased levels of fermentation
products, direct immune-modulating abilities of the components, their capability 
to reduce colonic epithelial damage and/or modulation of the microbiota. The
beneficial effects of the supplementation with a complex plant fibre and a
fibre-degrading probiotic parallel the effects seen in human microbiota with high
plant fibre diets.
