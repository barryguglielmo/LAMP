OBJECTIVE: STIs during pregnancy increase adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes
and may increase HIV risk. STI syndromic management is standard of care in South 
Africa. Our study evaluated the prevalence and incidence of STIs in pregnant
women and the associated risk factors.
METHODS: We combined data from two prospective observational studies of pregnant 
women enrolled while attending their first antenatal clinic (ANC) visit in
Tshwane District and Cape Town. Women ≥18 years were tested at first ANC visit
and at their first postpartum visit for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria
gonorrhoeae and Trichomonas vaginalis using Xpert assays (Cepheid, USA). We
evaluated the prevalence and incidence of STI and the associated risk factors
using multivariable regression models.
RESULTS: We enrolled 669 pregnant women, 64% (n=427) from Tshwane District and
36% (n=242) from Cape Town; 80% (n=534) were women living with HIV (WLHIV) and
20% (n=135) without HIV. At enrolment, 37% (n=250) were diagnosed with at least
one STI, of which 76% (n=190) were asymptomatic. STI prevalence was 40% (n=213)
in WLHIV and 27% (n=37) in women without HIV (p=0.01). Baseline STI infection was
associated with younger age (OR=0.95 per year, 95% CI 0.92 to 0.98), higher
gestational age (adjusted OR (aOR)=1.03 per week, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.05), single
relationship status (aOR=1.53, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.15) and HIV status (aOR=1.86,
95% CI 1.17 to 2.95). Of 419 participants with no STI at baseline, 21 had an
incident STI during follow-up, with a mean follow-up time of 140 days. The
incidence rate of STI during pregnancy and early post partum was 15 infections
per 100 women-years (95% CI 9 to 23). Younger age was associated with STI
incidence.
CONCLUSION: Our study shows high prevalence and incidence of STIs in pregnancy,
especially in WLHIV, demonstrating the need for STI screening in ANC to prevent
adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. Most STI cases were asymptomatic and would 
have gone untreated with syndromic management. Aetiological STI screening is
urgently needed to reduce the burden of STIs in pregnancy.
