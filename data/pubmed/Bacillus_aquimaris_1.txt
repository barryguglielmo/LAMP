The synthesis of bioplastic from marine microbes has a great attendance in the
realm of biotechnological applications for sustainable eco-management. This study
aims to isolate novel strains of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB)-producing bacteria 
from the mangrove rhizosphere, Red Sea, Saudi Arabia, and to characterize the
extracted polymer. The efficient marine bacterial isolates were identified by the
phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA genes as Tamlana crocina, Bacillus
aquimaris, Erythrobacter aquimaris, and Halomonas halophila. The optimization of 
PHB accumulation by E. aquimaris was achieved at 120 h, pH 8.0, 35 °C, and 2%
NaCl, using glucose and peptone as the best carbon and nitrogen sources at a C:N 
ratio of 9.2:1. The characterization of the extracted biopolymer by
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR),
and Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) proves the presence of hydroxyl,
methyl, methylene, methine, and ester carbonyl groups, as well as derivative
products of butanoic acid, that confirmed the structure of the polymer as PHB.
This is the first report on E. aquimaris as a PHB producer, which promoted the
hypothesis that marine rhizospheric bacteria were a new area of research for the 
production of biopolymers of commercial value.
