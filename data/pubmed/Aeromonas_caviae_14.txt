In aquaculture, antibiotics are commonly used to provide protection against
pathogens; however, this practice has become controversial due to increased
occurrences of microbial resistance, and alternatives are needed. This study
aimed to investigate the antimicrobial activity of yeast glycoprotein (YG)
against Aeromonas caviae. Pathogens were isolated from liver of diseased
Carassius auratus gibelio. Based on morphological and biochemical analysis,
together with 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the isolated strains were identified as
A. caviae and concluded as clones of a single strain and named L2. Further
pathogenicity analysis revealed that A. caviae possessed β-haemolysis, and its
median lethal dose for C. gibelio was 1.33 × 106  CFU/ml. Hepatic adenylate
kinase and pyruvate kinase activities of C. gibelio were inhibited post-A. caviae
infection. Antimicrobial drug test suggested that A. caviae was a
multidrug-resistant organism but could be inhibited by YG in vitro. Minimum
inhibitory and bactericidal concentration of YG was 83.3 mg/ml and 166.7 mg/ml,
respectively. Microbiota sequencing results showed that YG supplement could
obviously decrease the relative abundance of Aeromonas and increase the microbial
diversity. Our study revealed that A. caviae from C. gibelio was a
multidrug-resistant bacteria strain, and could be significantly inhibited by YG
in vivo and in vitro, thus providing important insights into ecological control
and pathogenesis of A. caviae in aquaculture.
