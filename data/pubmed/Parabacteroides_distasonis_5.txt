RATIONALE: Approximately 20-40% of patients with cancer will experience brain
metastasis (BM), which has a great impact on the quality of life and survival
rates of patients. Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) is an effective method for the
treatment of BM. However, it cannot be ignored that WBRT might induce a series of
neuropsychiatric side effects, including cognitive dysfunction (CD). Accumulating
evidence shows that the gut microbiota and the gut-microbiota-brain axis may play
a vital role in the pathogenesis of CD.
OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: We adopted WBRT to mimic CD after a hierarchical cluster
analysis of the Morris water maze test (MWMT) results. In addition, we observed
the effects of antibiotics and prebiotics on WBRT-induced CD. Variations were
revealed via the 16S rRNA sequencing analysis at different levels.
RESULTS: The 16S rRNA sequencing analysis revealed an altered composition of gut 
microbiota between CD and non-CD phenotypes. Furthermore, we observed a decrease 
in the levels of Phylum-Bacteroidete, Class-Bacteroidia, and Order-Bacteroidales 
in the CD group and an increase in the Genus-Allobaculum level after WBRT.
Pretreatment with antibiotics caused a significant decrease in the level of
Phylum-TM7 01, whereas an increase in the levels of Class-Gammaproteobacteria,
Order-Enterobacteriales, and Species-Escherichia coli. After pretreatment with
probiotics, the levels of Phylum-Cyanobacteria, Class-4C0d-2, and Order-YS2 were 
decreased, while the levels of Family-Bacteroidaceae, Genus-Bacteroides, and
Species-Parabacteroides distasonis were increased.
CONCLUSIONS: WBRT-induced CD might be highly related to abnormal composition of
gut microbiota. Strategies improving the composition of the gut microbiota may
provide beneficial effects on CD in individuals exposed to WBRT.
