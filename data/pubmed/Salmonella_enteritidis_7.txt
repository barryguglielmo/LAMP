In contrast to enteric fever, reports of secondary hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) in invasive non-typhoidal salmonellosis are scarce. We 
report a child with ceftriaxone-resistant invasive Salmonella Enteritidis
infection with secondary HLH, who was successfully managed with intravenous
meropenem. Secondary HLH in the context of S. Enteritidis has not been described 
before.
