Since 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is highly contagious with a high
mortality rate. France has taken strict infection control measures. According to 
the report by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, children are less
affected with COVID-19 and seem to have less severe disease than adults. We
reported the first confirmed infant case of co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and
Citrobacter koseri urinary infection in 6-week-old child admitted on 25 March
2020 with mild symptoms in the Pediatric COVID Unit of Amiens University
Hospital, France.
