The purpose of this study was to develop tea tree oil (TTO)-loaded
chitosan-poly(ε-caprolactone) core-shell nanocapsules (NC-TTO-Ch) aiming the
topical acne treatment. TTO was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry,
and nanocapsules were characterized regarding mean particle size (Z-average),
polydispersity index (PdI), zeta potential (ZP), pH, entrapment efficiency (EE), 
morphology by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and anti-Cutibacterium acnes
activity. The main constituents of TTO were terpinen-4-ol (37.11 %), γ-terpinene 
(16.32 %), α-terpinene (8.19 %), ρ-cimene (6.56 %), and α-terpineol (6.07 %).
NC-TTO-Ch presented Z-average of 268.0 ± 3.8 nm and monodisperse size
distribution (PdI < 0.3). After coating the nanocapsules with chitosan, we
observed an inversion in ZP to a positive value (+31.0 ± 1.8 mV). This finding
may indicate the presence of chitosan on the nanocapsules' surface, which was
corroborated by the AFM images. In addition, NC-TTO-Ch showed a slightly acidic
pH (∼5.0), compatible with topical application. The EE, based on Terpinen-4-ol
concentration, was approximately 95 %. This data suggests the nanocapsules'
ability to reduce the TTO volatilization. Furthermore, NC-TTO-Ch showed
significant anti-C. acnes activity, with a 4× reduction in the minimum inhibitory
concentration, compared to TTO and a decrease in C. acnes cell viability, with an
increase in the percentage of dead cells (17 %) compared to growth control (6.6
%) and TTO (9.7 %). Therefore, chitosan-poly(ε-caprolactone) core-shell
nanocapsules are a promising tool for TTO delivery, aiming at the activity
against C. acnes for the topical acne treatment.
