In the present study, the chemical composition of the essential oils from flowers
and leaves of Elaeoselinum asclepium (L.) Bertol subsp. meoides (Desf.) Fiori
collected in Central Sicily was evaluated by GC and GC-MS. The main volatile
components of the flowers were α-phellandrene (42.5%), terpinolene (15.7%),
p-cymene (11.6%) and β-phellandrene (10.2%), whereas the ones of the leaves were 
p-cymene (44.0%), α-pinene (13.2%), α-phellandrene (11.0%), β-phellandrene
(10.2%) and β-pinene (9.2%). Furthermore, the antibacterial and antifungal
activities against some microorganisms infesting historical art craft were
determined. The essential oil from leaves (EL) showed to be particularly active
against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus vulgaris. [Figure:
