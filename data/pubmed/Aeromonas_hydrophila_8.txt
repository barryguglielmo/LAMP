The gram-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped bacterium Aeromonas hydrophila, the
causative agent of motile aeromonad septicaemia, has attracted increasing
attention due to its high pathogenicity. Here, we constructed the complete genome
sequence of a virulent strain, A. hydrophila HX-3 isolated from Pseudosciaena
crocea and performed comparative genomics to investigate its virulence factors
and quorum sensing features in comparison with those of other Aeromonas isolates.
HX-3 has a circular chromosome of 4,941,513 bp with a 61.0% G + C content
encoding 4483 genes, including 4318 protein-coding genes, and 31 rRNA, 127 tRNA
and 7 ncRNA operons. Seventy interspersed repeat and 153 tandem repeat sequences,
7 transposons, 8 clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, and
39 genomic islands were predicted in the A. hydrophila HX-3 genome. Phylogeny and
pan-genome were also analyzed herein to confirm the evolutionary relationships on
the basis of comparisons with other fully sequenced Aeromonas genomes. In
addition, the assembled HX-3 genome was successfully annotated against the
Cluster of Orthologous Groups of proteins database (76.03%), Gene Ontology
database (18.13%), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome pathway database
(59.68%). Two-component regulatory systems in the HX-3 genome and virulence
factors profiles through comparative analysis were predicted, providing insights 
into pathogenicity. A large number of genes related to the AHL-type 1 (ahyI,
ahyR), LuxS-type 2 (luxS, pfs, metEHK, litR, luxOQU) and QseBC-type 3 (qseB,
qseC) autoinducer systems were also identified. As a result of the expression of 
the ahyI gene in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), combined UPLC-MS/MS profiling led
to the identification of several new N-acyl-homoserine lactone compounds
synthesized by AhyI. This genomic analysis determined the comprehensive QS
systems of A. hydrophila, which might provide novel information regarding the
mechanisms of virulence signatures correlated with QS.
