Streptococcus bovis bacteremia (currently called S. gallolyticus) represents an
infrequent condition, but associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality 
Amado et al. (2015). The clinical presentation is characterized by symptoms
associated with disseminated infection and with a higher frequency of
endocarditis and gastrointestinal neoplasms, often occult Amado et al. (2015),
Olmos et al. (2016). Probable sources of infection and zoonotic transmission have
not been explored in the literature. We present a case of disseminated infection 
after ingestion of a marine mammal.
