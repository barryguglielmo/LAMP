Antimicrobial and heavy-metal resistance of 29 Aeromonas spp. (Aeromonas
hydrophila n = 9, Aeromonas enteropelogenes n = 14, Aeromonas veronii n = 3,
Aeromonas salmonicida n = 2, and Aeromonas sobria n = 1) isolated from Pacific
abalone marketed in Korea were analyzed. All isolates were found to be resistant 
against ampicillin. High level of resistant to cephalothin (86%), rifampicin
(73%), imipenem (42%), and oxytetracycline (35%) were also detected. Thirteen
(45%) of the isolates showed multiple antimicrobial resistance (MAR) index ≥ 0.2.
The PCR assays implied the presence of qnrS, qnrB, qnrA, tetB, tetA, aac (3')-
IIa, aac(6')-Ib, aphAI-IAB, blaCTX, blaTEM, and intI1 genes among 76%, 28%, 14%, 
17%, 3%, 3%, 41%, 10%, 41%, 28%, and 66% of the isolates, respectively. Class 1
integron gene cassette profiles aadA1(3%) and aadA2 (3%) were also identified.
Lead (Pb) resistance was the highest (69%) among 5 heavy metals tested, whereas
38%, 27%, and 20% of the isolates were resistant to Cadmium (Cd), Chromium (Cr), 
and Copper (Cu), respectively. Heavy-metal resistance genes, CopA, CzcA, and merA
were positive in 83%, 75%, and 41% of the isolates, respectively. In conclusion, 
observed genotypic and phenotypic resistance profiles of Aeromonas spp. against
antimicrobials and heavy metals reveal the ability of serving as a source of
antimicrobials and heavy-metal-resistant traits.
