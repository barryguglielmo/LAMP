Effects of Electrokinetic Phenomena on Bacterial Deposition monitored by Quartz
Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation Monitoring (QCM-D).

Bacterial deposition is the first step in the formation of microbial biofilms in 
environmental technology, and there is high interest in controlling such
deposition. Earlier work indicated that direct electric current (DC) fields could
influence bacterial deposition in percolation columns. Here, a time-resolved
quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) and
microscopy-based cell counting were used to quantify DC field effects on the
deposition of bacterial strains Pseudomonas putida KT2440 and Pseudomonas
fluorescens LP6a at varying electrolyte concentrations and weak electric field
strengths (0-2 V cm-1). DC-induced frequency (Δf) shifts, dissipation energy
(ΔD), and ratios thereof (Δf/ΔD) proved as good indicators of the rigidity of
cell attachment. We interpreted QCM-D signals using a theoretical approach
calculating the attractive DLVO-force and the shear and drag forces acting on a
bacterium near collector surfaces in a DC electric field. We found that changes
in DC-induced deposition of bacteria depended on the relative strengths of
electrophoretic drag and electroosmotic shear forces. This could enable the
prediction and electrokinetic control of microbial deposition on surfaces in
natural and manmade ecosystems.
