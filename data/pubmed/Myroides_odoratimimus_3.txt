The genus Myroides are gram-negative bacilli which are completely aerobic,
non-motile, non-fermenting and yellow-pigmented with a characteristic fruity
odor. Myroides species are widely found in the environment, especially in water
and soil, and are considered as low-grade opportunistic pathogens for humans.
Myroides infections are most commonly seen in immunocompromised patients and only
rarely occur in immunocompetent patients. We here report the first confirmed
catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) due to Myroides odoratimimus in an
immunocompetent patient. We also review the literature related to Myroides
infections.
