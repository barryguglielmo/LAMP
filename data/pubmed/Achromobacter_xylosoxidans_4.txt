Antimicrobial peptides are important players of the innate host defence against
invading microorganisms. The aim of this study was to evaluate the activity of
airway antimicrobial peptides against the common cystic fibrosis (CF) pathogen
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and to compare it to the emerging multi-drug resistant CF
pathogens Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Clinical
bacterial isolates from CF patients were used, and the antimicrobial activity of 
human beta-defensin 2 and 3, LL37 and lysozyme was evaluated using radial
diffusion assay and viable counts. The cell surface zeta potential was analysed
to estimate the net charge at the bacterial surface. Of the bacterial species
included in the study, A. xylosoxidans was the most resistant to antimicrobial
peptides, whereas P. aeruginosa was the most susceptible. The net charge of the
bacterial surface was significantly more negative for P. aeruginosa compared to
A. xylosoxidans, which may in part explain the differences in susceptibility.
