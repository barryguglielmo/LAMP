115 isolates of lactic acid bacteria were screened from traditional fermented
foods in Guizhou province, China. The cholesterol-removed rates of 86 isolates
was in range 7.29%~25.66%, of which 18 isolates was more than 15%. According to
the results of physiological and biological test, 13 isolates were selected to
determined the fermentation performance. 9 isolates including
MT-4，MT-2，PJ-15，SR2-2，SQ-4，SQ-7，ST2-2，ST2-6，NR1-7 had high tolerance of bile salt
and acid. Moreover, ST2-2, SR2-2, NR1-7, SQ-4, MT-4 had high survival rate in
different concentration of NaCl and NaNO 2 under different temperature. According
to the result of BLAST comparison of 16S rRNA sequence in GeneBank database and
calculation the genetic distance of 16S rRNA sequence with ortho connected
algorithm, SR2-2, NR1-7, ST2-2 were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum , MT-4 
was identified as Lactobacillus pentosus , SQ-4 was identified as Lactobacillus
paraplantarum. Moreover, strains SQ-4 and MT-4 was added to fermented beef, the
result showed that fermented beef had delicious taste and was popular in
consumers because its proper pH, pleasant colors, high viable cell count, and
suitable content bound water and immobilized water. These results gave important 
information for the development of new starter formulation for the production of 
high quality fermented meat products.
