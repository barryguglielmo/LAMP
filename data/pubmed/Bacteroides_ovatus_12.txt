The microbiota is necessary for the induction of intestinal immunoglobulin A
(IgA). In this issue of Cell Host & Microbe, Yang et al. (2020) show that the
ability to induce or suppress IgA is characteristic of specific strains of
Bacteroides ovatus. Immunogenicity and IgA induction by the microbiota is
determined by inter-bacterial interaction.
