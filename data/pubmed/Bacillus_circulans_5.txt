The single-domain GH11 glycosidase from Bacillus circulans (BCX) is involved in
the degradation of hemicellulose, which is one of the most abundant renewable
biomaterials in nature. We demonstrate that BCX in solution undergoes minimal
structural changes during turnover. NMR spectroscopy results show that the rigid 
protein matrix provides a frame for fast substrate binding in multiple
conformations, accompanied by slow conversion, which is attributed to an
enzyme-induced substrate distortion. A model is proposed in which the rigid
enzyme takes advantage of substrate flexibility to induce a conformation that
facilitates the acyl formation step of the hydrolysis reaction.
