Worldwide, studies investigating the relationship between the lineage of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) across geographic areas has empowered the "End
TB" program and understand transmission across national boundaries. Genomic
diversity of MTB varies with geographical locations and ethnicity. Genomic
diversity can also affect the emergence of drug resistance. In Myanmar, we still 
have limited genetic information about geographical, ethnicity, and drug
resistance linkage to MTB genetic information. This study aimed to describe the
geno-spatial distribution of MTB and drug resistance profiles in Myanmar-Thailand
border areas. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a total of 109 sequenced
isolates. The lineages of MTB and the potential associated socio-demographic,
geographic and clinical factors were analyzed using Fisher's exact tests. p value
of statistically significance was set at < 0.05. We found that 67% of the
isolates were lineage 1 (L1)/East-African-Indian (EAI) (n = 73), followed by
lineage 2 (L2)/Beijing (n = 26), lineage 4 (L4)/European American (n = 6) and
lineage 3 (L3)/Delhi/Central Asian (n = 4). "Gender", "type of TB patient",
"sputum smear grading" and "streptomycin resistance" were significantly different
with the lineages of MTB. Sublineages of L1, which had never been reported
elsewhere in Myanmar, were detected in this study area. Moreover, both ethnicity 
and lineage of MTB significantly differed in distribution by patient location.
Diversity of the lineage of MTB and detection of new sublineages suggested that
this small area had been resided by a heterogeneous population group who actively
transmitted the disease. This information on distribution of lineage of MTB can
be linked in the future with those on the other side of the border to evaluate
cross-border transmission.
