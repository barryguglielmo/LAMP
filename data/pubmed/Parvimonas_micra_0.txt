Thirteen commercial essential oils were assessed for their possible inclusion in 
a mouthwash formulation based on their inhibitory effect against potentially
pathogenic anaerobic oral bacterial isolates from subgingival plaque, and their
cytotoxicity towards gingival cells. The essential oils, originating from species
belonging to seven major aromatic plant families, were chosen to provide the
necessary diversity in chemical composition that was analyzed in detail by GC and
GC-MS. Multivariate statistical analysis, performed using the in vitro
microbiological/toxicological assays and compositional data, revealed that the
major components of the essential oils were probably not the main carriers of the
activities observed. A formulation of "designer" mouthwashes is proposed based on
the selective action of certain essential oils towards specific bacterial
isolates (e.g. Citrus bergamia vs. Parvimonas micra ), and non-toxicity to
gingival cells at antimicrobially active concentrations.
