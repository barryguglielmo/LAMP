The utilisation of waste materials and industrial residues became a priority
within the bioeconomy concept and the production of biobased chemicals. The aim
of this study was to evaluate the feasibility to continuously produce L-lactic
acid from different renewable substrates, in a multi-substrate strategy mode.
Based on batch experiments observations, Bacillus coagulans A534 strain was able 
to continuously metabolise acid whey, sugar beet molasses, sugar bread, alfalfa
press green juice and tapioca starch. Additionally, reference experiments showed 
its behaviour in standard medium. Continuous fermentations indicated that the
highest productivity was achieved when molasses was employed with a value of
10.34 g·L-1·h-1, while the lactic acid to sugar conversion yield was 0.86 g·g-1. 
This study demonstrated that LA can be efficiently produced in continuous mode
regardless the substrate, which is a huge advantage in comparison to other
platform chemicals.
