Riboswitches are metabolite-sensing, conserved domains located in non-coding
regions of mRNA that are central to regulation of gene expression. Here we report
the first three-dimensional structure of the recently discovered
S-adenosyl-L-methionine responsive SAM-VI riboswitch. SAM-VI adopts a unique fold
and ligand pocket that are distinct from all other known SAM riboswitch classes. 
The ligand binds to the junctional region with its adenine tightly intercalated
and Hoogsteen base-paired. Furthermore, we reveal the ligand discrimination mode 
of SAM-VI by additional X-ray structures of this riboswitch bound to
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine and a synthetic ligand mimic, in combination with
isothermal titration calorimetry and fluorescence spectroscopy to explore binding
thermodynamics and kinetics. The structure is further evaluated by analysis of
ligand binding to SAM-VI mutants. It thus provides a thorough basis for
developing synthetic SAM cofactors for applications in chemical and synthetic RNA
biology.
