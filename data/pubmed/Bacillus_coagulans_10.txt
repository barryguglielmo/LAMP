The biotechnological production of platform chemicals from renewable resources is
in the scientific spotlight, as researchers seek to develop environmentally
friendly and cost-efficient processes to compete with the petroleum-based ones.
Lactic acid (LA) is an established platform chemical, registering an important
market share, mainly owing to the increasing demand for polylactic acid. This
study investigated the feasibility to produce LA from bakery waste hydrolysates
and lucerne green juice (LGJ) as inexpensive substrates, using a Bacillus
coagulans strain. A final LA concentration of 62.2 g/L, with a productivity of
2.59 g/(L.h) and a conversion yield of 0.57 g LA/ g bakery waste was achieved in 
batch fermentation mode. LA productivity reached 11.28 g/(L.h), using a
continuous fermentation system coupled with cell retention membranes at a
dilution rate of 0.2 h-1. The results indicate that bakery waste hydrolysates and
LGJ can be utilized for the production of highly optical pure L(+)-LA.
