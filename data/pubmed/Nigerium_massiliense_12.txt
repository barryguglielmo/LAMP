Therapeutic options for Mycobacterium abscessus infections are extremely limited.
New or repurposed drugs are needed. The anti-M. abscessus activity of AR-12
(OSU-03012), reported to express broad-spectrum antimicrobial effects, was
investigated in vitro and in vivo Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was
performed on 194 clinical isolates. Minimum bactericidal concentration and
time-kill kinetics assays were conducted to distinguish the bactericidal versus
bacteriostatic activity of AR-12. Synergy between AR-12 and five clinically
important antibiotics was determined using a checkerboard synergy assay. The
activity of AR-12 against intracellular M. abscessus residing within macrophage
was also evaluated. Finally, the potency of AR-12 in vivo was determined in a
neutropenic mouse model that mimics pulmonary M. abscessus infection. AR-12
exhibited high anti-M. abscessus activity in vitro, with an MIC50 of 4 mg/liter
(8.7 μM) and an MIC90 of 8 mg/liter (17.4 μM) for both subsp. abscessus and
subsp. massiliense AR-12 and amikacin exhibited comparable bactericidal activity 
against extracellular M. abscessus in culture. AR-12, however, exhibited
significantly greater intracellular antibacterial activity than amikacin and
caused a significant reduction in the bacterial load in the lungs of neutropenic 
mice infected with M. abscessus No antagonism between AR-12 and clarithromycin,
amikacin, imipenem, cefoxitin, or tigecycline was evident. In conclusion, AR-12
is active against M. abscessus in vitro and in vivo and does not antagonize the
most frequently used anti-M. abscessus drugs. As such, AR-12 is a potential
candidate to include in novel strategies to treat M. abscessus infections.
