Abiotrophia defectiva is a rare cause of endocarditis with a high embolization
rate compared to other streptococcal endocarditis. Neurological complications may
occur in 20-40% of cases, and include intracranial aneurysms and sub-arachnoid
hemorrhage. Its isolation in the central nervous system (CNS) is extremely rare
and is associated with previous neurosurgical procedures. We present the case of 
a 51-year-old patient who suffered an ischemic stroke as a complication of A.
defectiva endocarditis, and the cases of CNS infections caused by this
microorganism are reviewed. The relevance of the case lies in its singular
character, due to the absence of previous valve disease in the patient without a 
recent history of invasive procedures or surgical interventions.
