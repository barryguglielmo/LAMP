Mycobacterium kansasii is an opportunistic pathogen that causes both
intrapulmonary and extrapulmonary infections. The symptoms of the pulmonary
diseases caused by M. kansasii closely resemble Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Rapid
and accurate differentiation of M. kansasii from M. tuberculosis, as well as
other mycobacteria, is crucial for developing effective therapeutics and disease 
treatment. In this study, we combined loop-mediated isothermal amplification
(LAMP) with lateral flow biosensors (LFB) to detect M. kansasii, by targeting the
species-specific sequence of rpoB, a gene which encodes the β subunit of
bacterial RNA polymerase. The assay was validated to ensure that it was highly
selective by testing M. kansasii, M. tuberculosis, other species of respiratory
bacteria, and other nontuberculous mycobacteria. The detection limit of the assay
was 1 fg/μL of DNA and 50 CFU of bacilli in sputum. The M. kansasii-LAMP-LFB
assay is a fast, cheap, and accurate method for detecting M. kansasii by constant
temperature amplification and simple interpretation.
