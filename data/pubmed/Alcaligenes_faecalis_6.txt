Colistin is a last-resort drug used to treat infections caused by
multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria that have developed carbapenem
resistance. Emergence and rapid dissemination of the nine plasmid-mediated mobile
colistin resistance genes (mcr-1 to mcr-9) has led to fear of pandrug-resistant
infections worldwide. To date, there is only limited information on colistin
resistance in African countries where the drug is widely used in agriculture. In 
this Nigerian study, 583 non-duplicate bacterial strains were isolated from 1119 
samples from humans, camels, cattle, dogs, pigs and poultry using
colistin-supplemented MacConkey agar, among which 17.0% (99/583) were
colistin-resistant. PCR (mcr-1 to mcr-9) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS)
identified mcr in 21.2% (21/99) of colistin-resistant isolates: mcr-1.1 (n = 13),
mcr-8.1 (n = 5), mcr-1.1 and mcr-8.1 (n = 2), and mcr-1.1 and mcr-5 (n = 1). Of
the 21 mcr-positive strains, 9 were isolated from human samples, with 8 being
Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 6 of these human K. pneumoniae had a high colistin MIC
(>64 μg/mL). In contrast, 9 of the 12 mcr-positive animal isolates were
Escherichia coli, of which only 2 had a colistin MIC of >64 μg/mL. This study is 
the first to report mcr-1 in Alcaligenes faecalis and the emergence of mcr-5 and 
mcr-8 in Nigeria. WGS determined that mcr-1 was localised on an IncX4 plasmid and
that 95.2% of mcr-1 harbouring isolates (20/21) transferred colistin resistance
successfully by conjugation. These findings highlight the global spread of
colistin resistance and emphasise the urgent need for co-ordinated global action 
to combat resistant bacteria.
