Background: The simultaneous and effective conversion of both pentose and hexose 
in fermentation is a critical and challenging task toward the lignocellulosic
economy. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of an innovative
co-fermentation process featuring with a cell recycling unit (CF/CR) for mixed
sugar utilization. A l-lactic acid-producing strain Enterococcus mundtii QU 25
was applied in the continuous fermentation process, and the mixed sugars were
utilized at different productivities after the flowing conditions were changed. A
mathematical model was constructed with the experiments to optimize the
biological process and clarify the cell metabolism through kinetics analysis. The
structured model, kinetic parameters, and achievement of the fermentation
strategy shall provide new insights toward whole sugar fermentation via real-time
monitoring for process control and optimization.
Results: Significant carbon catabolite repression in co-fermentation using a
glucose/xylose mixture was overcome by replacing glucose with cellobiose, and the
ratio of consumed pentose to consumed hexose increased significantly from 0.096
to 0.461 by mass. An outstanding product concentration of 65.2 g L-1 and
productivity of 13.03 g L-1 h-1 were achieved with 50 g L-1 cellobiose and
30 g L-1 xylose at an optimized dilution rate of 0.2 h-1, and the cell retention 
time gradually increased. Among the total lactic acid production, xylose
contributed to more than 34% of the mixed sugars, which was close to the related 
contents in agricultural residuals. The model successfully simulated the
transition of sugar consumption, cell growth, and lactic acid production among
the batch, continuous process, and CF/CR systems.
Conclusion: Cell retention time played a critical role in balancing pentose and
hexose consumption, cell decay, and lactic acid production in the CF/CR process. 
With increasing cell concentration, consumption of mixed sugars increased with
the productivity of the final product; hence, the impact of substrate inhibition 
was reduced. With the validated parameters, the model showed the highest accuracy
simulating the CF/CR process, and significantly longer cell retention times
compared to hydraulic retention time were tested.
