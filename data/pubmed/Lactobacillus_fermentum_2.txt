Using retinoic acid to inducer, we successfully established a rat model of
secondary osteoporosis and verified the preventive effect of Lactobacillus
fermentum ZS40 (ZS40) on secondary osteoporosis. Serum biochemical indicators
showed that ZS40 can effectively slow down bone resorption caused by retinoic
acid, increase blood content of calcium, phosphorus, bone alkaline phosphatase,
bone gla protein, and insulin-like growth factor 1, and decrease blood content of
tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) 5b. qRT-PCR results showed that ZS40
could upregulate mRNA expressions of β-catenin, Wnt10b, Lrp5, Lrp6, Runx2, ALP,
RANKL, and OPG, and downregulate mRNA expression of DKK1, RANK, TRACP, and CTSK
in the rats' spinal cord. Results following TRAP staining showed that ZS40 could 
slow down retinoic acid-induced formation of osteoclasts. Micro-CT results showed
that ZS40 could reduce Tb.Sp, increase BV/TV, Tb.N, Tb.Th, and ultimately
increase bone mineral density of rats in vivo. These findings indicate that ZS40 
might have a potential role in preventing retinoic acid-induced secondary
osteoporosis in vivo.
