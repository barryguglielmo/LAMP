Susceptibility of patients to antibiotic-associated C. difficile disease is
intimately associated with specific changes to gut microbiome composition. In
particular, loss of microbes that modify bile salt acids (BSA) play a central
role; primary bile acids stimulate spore germination whilst secondary bile acids 
limit C. difficile vegetative growth. To determine the relative contribution of
bile salt (BS) metabolism on C. difficile disease severity, we treated mice with 
three combinations of antibiotics prior to infection. Mice given clindamycin
alone became colonized but displayed no tissue pathology while severe disease,
exemplified by weight loss and inflammatory tissue damage occurred in animals
given a combination of five antibiotics and clindamycin. Animals given only the
five antibiotic cocktails showed only transient colonization and no disease. C.
difficile colonization was associated with a reduction in bacterial diversity, an
inability to amplify bile salt hydrolase (BSH) sequences from fecal DNA and a
relative increase in primary bile acids (pBA) in cecal lavages from infected
mice. Further, the link between BSA modification and the microbiome was confirmed
by the isolation of strains of Lactobacillus murinus that modified primary bile
acids in vitro, thus preventing C. difficile germination. Interestingly, BSH
activity did not correlate with disease severity which appeared linked to
alternations in mucin, which may indirectly lead to increased exposure of the
epithelial surface to inflammatory signals. These data confirm the role of
microbial metabolic activity in protection of the gut and highlights the need for
greater understanding the function of bacterial communities in disease
prevention.
