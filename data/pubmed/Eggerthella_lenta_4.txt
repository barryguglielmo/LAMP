BACKGROUND: The relationship between the composition and function of gut
microbial communities and early-onset calcium oxalate kidney stone disease is
unknown.
METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of 88 individuals aged 4-18 years,
which included 44 individuals with kidney stones containing ≥50% calcium oxalate 
and 44 controls matched for age, sex, and race. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing
and untargeted metabolomics were performed on stool samples.
RESULTS: Participants who were kidney stone formers had a significantly less
diverse gut microbiome compared with controls. Among bacterial taxa with a
prevalence >0.1%, 31 taxa were less abundant among individuals with
nephrolithiasis. These included seven taxa that produce butyrate and three taxa
that degrade oxalate. The lower abundance of these bacteria was reflected in
decreased abundance of the gene encoding butyryl-coA dehydrogenase (P=0.02). The 
relative abundance of these bacteria was correlated with the levels of 18 fecal
metabolites, and levels of these metabolites differed in individuals with kidney 
stones compared with controls. The oxalate-degrading bacterial taxa identified as
decreased in those who were kidney stone formers were components of a larger
abundance correlation network that included Eggerthella lenta and several
Lactobacillus species. The microbial (α) diversity was associated with age of
stone onset, first decreasing and then increasing with age. For the individuals
who were stone formers, we found the lowest α diversity among individuals who
first formed stones at age 9-14 years, whereas controls displayed no age-related 
differences in diversity.
CONCLUSIONS: Loss of gut bacteria, particularly loss of those that produce
butyrate and degrade oxalate, associates with perturbations of the metabolome
that may be upstream determinants of early-onset calcium oxalate kidney stone
disease.
