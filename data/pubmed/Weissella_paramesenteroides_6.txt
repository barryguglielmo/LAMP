Weissella paramesenteroides has gained a considerable attention as bacteriocin
and exopolysaccharide producers. However, potential of W. paramesenteroides to
utilize different prebiotics is unexplored area of research. Fruits being vectors
of various probiotics, five W. paramesenteroides strains, namely, FX1, FX2, FX5, 
FX9, and FX12, were isolated from different fruits. They were screened and
selected based on their ability to survive at pH 2.5 and in 1.0% sodium
taurocholate, high cell surface hydrophobicity, mucin adhesion, bile-induced
biofilm formation, antimicrobial activity (AMA) against selected enteropathogens,
and prebiotic utilization ability, implicating the functional properties of these
strains. In vitro safety evaluation showed that strains were susceptible to
antibiotics except vancomycin and did not harbor any virulent traits such as
biogenic amine production, hemolysis, and DNase production. Based on their
functionality, two strains FX5 and FX9 were selected for prebiotic utilization
studies by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)
production by high performance liquid chromatography. TLC profile evinced the
ability of these two strains to utilize low molecular weight
galactooligosaccharides (GOS) and fructooligosaccharides (FOS), as only the upper
low molecular weight fractions were disappeared from cell-free-supernatants
(CFS). Enhanced β-galactosidase activity correlated with galactose accumulation
in residual CFS of GOS displayed GOS utilization ability. Both the strains
exhibited AMA against E. coli and Staph. aureus and high SCFAs production in the 
presence of prebiotic, suggesting their synbiotic potential. Thus, W.
paramesenteroides strains FX5 and FX9 exhibit potential probiotic properties with
prebiotic utilization and can be taken forward to evaluate synergistic synbiotic 
potential in detail.
