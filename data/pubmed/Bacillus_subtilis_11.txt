The essential oils (EOs) of Origanum floribundum Munby, an aromatic and medicinal
plant endemic in Algeria, were extracted by different hydrodistillation times
(30 min, 1, 2 and 3 h) and analyzed by GC and GC-MS. The chromatographic analysis
showed that thymol (32.7-45.0%), p-cymene (16.8-23.1%) and γ-terpinene
(21.6-28.7%) were the most prominent components of the oils. The antioxidant
ability was measured using the reductive potential, thiobarbituric acid reactive 
substances (TBARS) assay and the inhibition of free radicals DPPH● and ABTS●+.
Antibacterial activity was assessed by the disc diffusion method against three
bacteria (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis) and one 
fungus (Candida albicans). Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were
determined using a microdilution method. Thymol is one of the compounds of EOs,
which are widely reported as very biologically active. Although the oil isolated 
for 30 min was the less-thymol rich, it was the most active with all the
antioxidant tests. In the most cases, the antimicrobial activity showed the best 
results with oils isolated for 30 min and 3 h (MIC = 0.25-1.75 μL/mL). These
results suggest that it might be possible to isolate the EO from this plant for a
minimum distillation time to obtain oil that can give maximum biological
activities.
