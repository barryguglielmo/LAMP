BACKGROUND: Recently, stool multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests have 
been developed for identifying diarrhea-causing bacterial pathogens. Furthermore,
fecal calprotectin is a well-known effective marker for intestinal mucosal
inflammation.
AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of stool multiplex PCR and fecal calprotectin in
acute infectious diarrhea.
METHODS: Overall, 400 patients with acute infectious diarrhea were enrolled from 
Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital (January 2016 to December 2018). Multiplex PCR
detected 7 enteropathogenic bacteria including Salmonella, Campylobacter,
Shigella, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Aeromonas, Vibrio, and Clostridium difficile.
We reviewed clinical and laboratory findings using stool multiplex PCR.
RESULTS: Stool multiplex PCR test detected considerably more bacterial pathogens 
than stool culture (49.2% vs 5.2%), with Campylobacter as the most common
pathogen (54%). Patients with positive stool PCR showed elevated fecal
calprotectin expression compared to patients with negative stool PCR (1124.5 ±
816.9 mg/kg vs 609 ± 713.2 mg/kg, P = 0.001). C-reactive protein (OR = 1.01,
95%CI: 1.001-1.027, P = 0.034) and sigmoidoscopy-detected colitis (OR = 4.76,
95%CI: 1.101-20.551, P = 0.037) were independent factors in stool PCR-based
detection of bacterial pathogens. Sensitivity and specificity of calprotectin
were evaluated to be 70.5% and 60.9%, respectively (adjusted cut-off value = 388 
mg/kg).
CONCLUSION: Stool multiplex PCR test has increased sensitivity in detecting
pathogens than conventional culture, and it is correlated with calprotectin
expression. Stool multiplex PCR and calprotectin may be effective in predicting
clinical severity of infectious diarrhea.
