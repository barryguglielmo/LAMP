Furfuryl alcohol is an important reduction product from biomass derived furfural.
This study developed one-pot biosynthesis of furfuryl alcohol and lactic acid by 
a glucose coupled biphasic system using single Bacillus coagulans NL01.
Water/dioctyl phthalate is chosen as biphasic system to alleviate the toxicity of
furfural and furfuryl alcohol. Under the optimal conditions, the
high-concentration conversion (208 mM) of furfural was successfully converted in 
6 h reaction with 98% furfural conversion and 88% furfuryl alcohol selectivity.
Notably, glucose as co-substrate could be effectively converted to lactic acid in
this biphasic system. About 264 mM furfuryl alcohol and 64.2 g/L lactic acid were
simultaneously produced from 310 mM furfural and 71.3 g/L glucose within 8.5 h by
a fed-batch strategy. The developed approach can not only increase the produced
furfuryl alcohol concentration but also reduce the cost of overall approach by
lactic acid co-production, indicating its potential for industrial applications.
