BACKGROUND: The emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant gram-negative
bacteria (MDR) has become a major public health concern worldwide. This
resistance is caused by enzymes-mediated genes (i.e., extended spectrum
beta-lactamases) that are common in certain Enterobacterioceae species. However, 
the distribution of these genes is poorly documented in Burkina Faso. This study 
aims to determine the prevalence and distribution of the resistant genes coding
for broad spectrum beta-lactamases and quinolones in rural Burkina Faso.
METHODS: Multiplex PCR assays were carried out to detect ESBL-encoding genes,
including blaOXA, blaTEM, blaCTX-M, blaSHV. The assays also assessed the presence
of quinolone resistance gene namely qnrA, qnrB and qnrS in the
quinolone-resistance DEC and Salmonella strains.
RESULTS: The Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamases (ESBL) resistance phenotype was
reported in all the E. coli isolates (5/5). Cross-resistance phenotype to
quinolones (CRQ) was shown by one Salmonella strain (1/9) and three E. coli
(3/5). Cross-resistance phenotypes to fluoroquinolones (CRFQ) were harboured by
one Salmonella (1/9) and carbapenemase phenotypes were detected in two E. coli
strains (2/5). Whilst the blaOXA genes were detected in 100% (5/5) of E. coli
isolates and in 33.33% (3/9) Salmonella isolates. One strain of E. coli (1/5)
harbored the blaCTX-M gene and the qnrB gene simultaneously.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified β-lactam (bla) and quinolone resistance (qnr) 
genes in multidrug-resistant E. coli and Salmonella spp. in rural Burkina Faso.
Our finding which highlighted the enterobacteriaceae strains resistance to
β-lactams and quinolones are of high interest for adequate management of
antimicrobial resistant genes outbreak in Burkina Faso.
