Compact CRISPR/Cas9 systems that can be packaged into an adeno-associated virus
(AAV) hold great promise for gene therapy. Unfortunately, currently available
small Cas9 nucleases either display low activity or require a long protospacer
adjacent motif (PAM) sequence, limiting their extensive applications. Here, we
screened a panel of Cas9 nucleases and identified a small Cas9 ortholog from
Staphylococcus auricularis (SauriCas9), which recognizes a simple NNGG PAM,
displays high activity for genome editing, and is compact enough to be packaged
into an AAV for genome editing. Moreover, the conversion of adenine and cytosine 
bases can be achieved by fusing SauriCas9 to the cytidine and adenine deaminase. 
Therefore, SauriCas9 holds great potential for both basic research and clinical
applications.
