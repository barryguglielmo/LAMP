Bacterial vectors, as microscopic living 'robotic factories', can be reprogrammed
into microscopic living 'robotic factories', using a top-down bioengineering
approach to produce and deliver anticancer agents. Most of the current research
has focused on bacterial species such as Salmonella typhimurium or Clostridium
novyi. However, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) is another promising candidate
with probiotic properties. EcN offers increased applicability for cancer
treatment with the development of new molecular biology and complete genome
sequencing techniques. In this review, we discuss the genetics and physical
properties of EcN. We also summarize and analyse recent studies regarding tumour 
therapy mediated by EcN. Many challenges remain in the development of more
promising strategies for combatting cancer with EcN.
