Purpose: This study aimed to detect the prevalence of carbapenemase producers
(CPs) among extensive drug-resistant (XDR)-carbapenemase producing Gram-negative 
bacteria (GNB) recovered from various clinical specimens of hospitalized
neutrophilic febrile patients in two major tertiary care hospitals in Egypt.
Methods: Standard methods were used to evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility 
of clinical isolates according to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI). Phenotypic and genotypic analysis of CPs were carried
out and statistically analyzed using standard methods.
Results: Three hundred and forty-two GNB were obtained from 342 clinical
specimens during the period of the study, where 162 (47%) were enterobacterial
isolates, including, 63 (18.4%) Escherichia coli, 87 (25.4%) Klebsiella spp., 5
(1.46%) Enterobacter cloacae, 5 (1.46%) Salmonella spp. and 2 (0.6%) Proteus and 
180 (53%) were non-fermentative bacilli including, 129 (37.7%), Acinetobacter
baumannii, and 51 (14.9%), Pseudomonas spp. Out of the 342 GNB, 188 (54.9%)
isolates were multi-drug resistant (MDR). Of these, 52 (27.6%) were XDR as well
as CPs as confirmed phenotypically. The MIC of imipenem against the XDR GNB
against showed either low (11 isolates; 21.1%; MIC range =4-32 µg/mL) or high
levels of resistance (41 isolates; 78.8%; MIC range = 64-≥1024). The most
prevalent carbapenem resistance (CR) genes were blaKPC (63.5%) followed by
blaOXA-48 (55.7%) and blaVIM (28.8%). No significant association could be
observed between the MIC level and the presence of CR genes (P value >0.05).
Conclusion: High prevalence of MDR (54.9%) and XDR (27.6%) GNB pathogens
associated with high levels of resistance to carbapenems were observed. All XDR
GNB were CPs and tested positive for at least one of the CR genes. However, most 
of them (78.8%) showed a high level of CR (MIC range = 64-≥1024) with no
significant association with the CR genes.
