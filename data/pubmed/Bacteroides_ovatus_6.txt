Modulation of the gut microbiome as a means to improve human health has recently 
gained increasing interest. In this study, it was investigated whether cRG-I, a
carrot-derived pectic polysaccharide, enriched in rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I)
classifies as a potential prebiotic ingredient using novel in vitro models.
First, digestion methods involving Î±-amylase/brush border enzymes demonstrated
the non-digestibility of cRG-I by host-derived enzymes versus digestible
(starch/maltose) and non-digestible controls (inulin). Then, a recently developed
short-term (48 h) colonic incubation strategy was applied and revealed that cRG-I
fermentation increased levels of health-promoting short-chain fatty acids (SCFA; 
mainly acetate and propionate) and lactate comparable but not identical to the
reference prebiotic inulin. Upon upgrading this fermentation model by inclusion
of a simulated mucosal environment while applying quantitative 16S-targeted
Illumina sequencing, cRG-I was additionally shown to specifically stimulate
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) related to health-associated species such as
Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bacteroides dorei,
Bacteroides ovatus, Roseburia hominis, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and
Eubacterium hallii. Finally, in a novel model to assess host-microbe interactions
(Caco-2/peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) co-culture) fermented cRG-I
increased barrier integrity while decreasing markers for inflammation. In
conclusion, by using novel in vitro models, cRG-I was identified as a promising
prebiotic candidate to proceed to clinical studies.
