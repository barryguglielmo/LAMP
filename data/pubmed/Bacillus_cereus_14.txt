Plant- and/or microbe-based systems can provide a cost-effective, sustainable
means to remove contaminants from soil. Microbe-assisted phytoremediation has
potential utility for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as fluoranthene (Flu)
removal from soils; however, the efficiency varies with the plant and microbes
used. This study evaluated the Flu removal efficiency in a system with ryegrass
(Lolium multiflorum), an IAA-producing Arthrobacter pascens strain (ZZ21), and/or
a Flu-degrading Bacillus cereus strain (Z21). Strain ZZ21 significantly enhanced 
the growth of ryegrass. Ryegrass in combination with both strains (FIP) was the
most effective method for Flu removal. By day 60, 74.9% of the Flu was depleted
in the FIP treatment, compared with 21.1% in the control (CK), 63.7% with
ryegrass alone (P), 69.0% for ryegrass with ZZ21 (IP), and 72.6% for ryegrass
with Z21 (FP). FIP treatment promoted ryegrass growth, accelerated Flu
accumulation in plants, and increased soil microbial counts. Microbial carbon
utilization was significantly higher in soil in the FIP than with the CK
treatment. Principal component analysis of the distribution of carbon substrate
utilization showed that microbial functional profiles diverged among treatments, 
and this divergence became more profound at day 60 than day 30. Microbial
inoculation significantly enhanced microbial utilization of phenols. Microbes in 
the FIP soil dominantly utilized amines/amides and phenols at day 30 but shifted 
to carbohydrates by day 60. Together, the combination of IAA-producing microbes
and Flu-degrading microbes could promote plant growth, facilitate Flu
degradation, and change soil microbial functional structure.
