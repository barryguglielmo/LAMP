The genome sequence, morphology, and genetic features of a novel phage, named
SSE1, is reported here. Phage SSE1 that infects Shigella dysenteriae (China
General Microbiological Culture Collection Center number: 1.1869) was isolated
from the aeration tank water of a sewage treatment plant. SSE1 showed
morphological features associated with those of phages in Myoviridae. The whole
genome sequence of phage SSE1 is composed of 169,744Â bp with the GC content of
37.51%. The double-stranded DNA of SSE1 contains 270 open reading frameworks
(ORFs). Phylogenetically, phage SSE1 showed a stronger homology (whole genome and
terminase large subunit protein sequence) to Escherichia phages than other
Shigella phages in the NCBI database, but SSE1 did not infect Escherichia stains.
This indicates that phage SSE1 should be a novel phage infecting Shigella
dysenteriae. Besides, the result of this study provided a new idea for phage
therapy. SSE1 may become a candidate for potential therapy against Shigella
dysenteriae infection in clinical applications.
