Food-associated Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (Lpb. plantarum) strains,
previously classified as Lactobacillus plantarum, are a promising strategy to
face intestinal inflammatory diseases. Our study was aimed at clarifying the
protective role of food-borne Lpb. plantarum against inflammatory damage by
testing the scavenging microbial ability both in selected strains and in
co-incubation with normal mucosa intestinal cells (NCM460). Here, we show that
Lpb. plantarum endure high levels of induced oxidative stress through partially
neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS), whereas they elicit their production 
when co-cultured with NCM460. Moreover, pre-treatment with food-borne Lpb.
plantarum significantly reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17F and IL-23 levels
in inflamed NCM460 cells. Our results suggest that food-vehicled Lpb. plantarum
strains might reduce inflammatory response in intestinal cells by directly
modulating local ROS production and by triggering the IL-23/IL-17 axis with
future perspectives on health benefits in the gut derived by the consumption of
functional foods enriched with selected strains.
