The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the efficiency of bovine (CW)
and buffalo cheese whey (BCW) as encapsulating agents for the spray-drying (SD)
of endogenous Lactobacillus pentosus ML 82 and the reference strain Lactobacillus
plantarum ATCC 8014. Their protective features were also tested for resistance to
storage (90 days, 25 °C), simulated gastrointestinal tract (GIT) conditions, and 
for their application in orange juice. Survival rates after SD were approximately
95% in all samples tested, meaning both CW and BCW performed satisfactorily.
After 90 days of storage, both species remained above 7 log Colony Forming Units 
(CFU)/g. However, CW generally enabled higher bacterial viability throughout this
period. CW microcapsule characteristics were also more stable, which is indicated
by the fact that BCW had higher moist content. Under GIT conditions, encapsulated
lactobacilli had higher survival rates than free cells regardless of
encapsulating agent. Even so, results indicate that CW and BCW perform better
under gastric conditions than intestinal conditions. Regarding their use in
orange juice, coating materials were probably dissolved due to low pH, and both
free and encapsulated bacteria had similar survival rates. Overall, CW and BCW
are suitable encapsulating agents for lactic acid bacteria, as they provided
protection during storage and against harmful GIT conditions.
