Today methicillin resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MR-CoNS) are
important in terms of causing significant nosocomial infections. Besides, MR-CoNS
are confirmed as the reservoir of SCCmec elements that carry mecA
(methicillin-resistant) gene. Hence, the present study was designed to evaluate
the susceptibility pattern, prevalence and diversity of SCCmec types I, II, III, 
and IV in MR-CoNS strains. In this cross-sectional study, 44 clinical isolates of
MR-CoNS were identified using the cefoxitin disc method and further confirmation 
by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the mecA gene. Antimicrobial 
susceptibility of isolates was investigated by disc diffusion. The identification
of CoNS was done by amplification and sequencing of the tuf gene. Multiplex PCR
method was done for the determination of SCCmec types. In the present study, the 
Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus were the most
predominant isolates with a prevalence of 45.4%. The highest resistance rates
were observed against erythromycin (84.1%) and clindamycin (75%). Multiplex PCR
revealed the SCCmec type I as the predominant type in the present study. Our
study showed that there was no significant relationship between the presence of
different types of SCCmec elements and resistance to antibiotics. The present
study highlighted a frequent prevalence of MR-CoNS harboring SCCmec type genes in
Ahvaz, southwest of Iran. Thus, the molecular typing and periodical monitoring of
their drug resistance pattern should be considered in national stewardship
programs to designing useful antibiotic prescription strategies.
