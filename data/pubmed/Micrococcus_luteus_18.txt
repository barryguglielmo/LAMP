The skin`s microbiome is predominantly commensalic, harbouring a metabolic
potential far exceeding that of its host. While there is clear evidence that
bacteria-dependent metabolism of pollutants modulates the toxicity for the host
there is still a lack of models for investigating causality of
microbiome-associated pathophysiology or toxicity. We now report on a
biologically characterised microbial-skin tissue co-culture that allows studying 
microbe-host interactions for extended periods of time in situ. The system is
based on a commercially available 3D skin model. In a proof-of-concept, this
model was colonised with single and mixed cultures of two selected skin
commensals. Two different methods were used to quantify the bacteria on the
surface of the skin models. While Micrococcus luteus established a stable
microbial-skin tissue co-culture, Pseudomonas oleovorans maintained slow
continuous growth over the 8-day cultivation period. A detailed skin
transcriptome analysis showed bacterial colonisation leading to up to 3318
significant changes. Additionally, FACS, ELISA and Western blot analyses were
carried out to analyse secretion of cytokines and growth factors. Changes found
in colonised skin varied depending on the bacterial species used and comprised
immunomodulatory functions, such as secretion of IL-1α/β, Il-6, antimicrobial
peptides and increased gene transcription of IL-10 and TLR2. The colonisation
also influenced the secretion of growth factors such as VFGFA and FGF2. Notably, 
many of these changes have already previously been associated with the presence
of skin commensals. Concomitantly, the model gained first insights on the
microbiome's influence on skin xenobiotic metabolism (i.e., CYP1A1, CYP1B1 and
CYP2D6) and olfactory receptor expression. The system provides urgently needed
experimental access for assessing the toxicological impact of
microbiome-associated xenobiotic metabolism in situ.
