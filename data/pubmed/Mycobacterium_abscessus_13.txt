Pulmonary infections caused by Mycobacterium abscessus (MA) have increased over
recent decades, affecting individuals with underlying pathologies such as chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis and, especially, cystic fibrosis.
The lack of a representative and standardized model of chronic infection in mice 
has limited steps forward in the field of MA pulmonary infection. To overcome
this challenge, we refined the method of agar beads to establish MA chronic
infection in immunocompetent mice. We evaluated bacterial count, lung pathology
and markers of inflammation and we performed longitudinal studies with magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) up to three months after MA infection. In this model, MA 
was able to establish a persistent lung infection for up to two months and with
minimal systemic spread. Lung histopathological analysis revealed granulomatous
inflammation around bronchi characterized by the presence of lymphocytes,
aggregates of vacuolated histiocytes and a few neutrophils, mimicking the damage 
observed in humans. Furthermore, MA lung lesions were successfully monitored for 
the first time by MRI. The availability of this murine model and the introduction
of the successfully longitudinal monitoring of the murine lung lesions with MRI
pave the way for further investigations on the impact of MA pathogenesis and the 
efficacy of novel treatments.
