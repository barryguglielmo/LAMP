The gut microbial diversity of Thai people was investigated between two large
cohorts, adult and elderly subjects, from the middle region of Thailand; the
cohorts were divided into different age groups of healthy adult (73) and elderly 
subjects (47). The diversities of the groups were characterized using a
pyrosequencing technique with primers targeting the V6-V8 region of the 16S rRNA 
gene, and a significant decrease in the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes ratio from
7.3 to 4.5 was observed with increased age. The microbiota of the adult and
elderly groups had a significantly higher abundance of the phylum Actinobacteria,
including the three species Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium longum 
and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, and the phylum Bacteroidetes containing
the four species Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides caccae
and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. Firmicutes showed no significant differences
between the two groups. Eleven species belonging to Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and
Proteobacteria were shared by at least 90% of all subjects and defined as core
gut microbiota of healthy Thai, among which a high abundance of Escherichia coli 
was particularly characterized in Thai elderly individuals. Multiple linear
regression analysis of age, gender, BMI and diet consumption frequency showed the
correlation of age with Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium. Rice consumption
frequency showed a significant positive correlation with Bacteroides, while no
correlation was found for other factors. Taken together, in the gut of Thai
adults, Bifidobacterium decreased and Bacteroides increased with age, while rice 
consumption increased the abundance of Bacteroides. These link of age and food,
especially rice carbohydrate, to gut microbiota and health could be ultimately
proposed as the Thai feature.
