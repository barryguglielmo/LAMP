BACKGROUND: The worldwide spread of organisms with antimicrobial resistance is of
concern, especially the trend of significantly increasing carbapenemase-producing
Enterobacterales (CPE). In this study, we investigated the annual trend of
intestinal CPE carriage rates in inpatients and healthy adults in a primary care 
hospital in Tenri, Japan.
METHODS: We collected 551 samples of feces from inpatients in our institution and
936 samples from healthy people living in Tenri city from December 2012 to April 
2015. All samples were cultured on MacConkey agar plates containing 4 μg/mL
ceftazidime for screening test. The colonies grown on the screening medium were
detected for carbapenemase genes (blaIMP-1, blaIMP-2, blaVIM, blaKPC, blaGES,
blaNDM, and blaOXA-48 groups) by multiplex PCR, and CPE were identified by
MALDI-TOF MS. Plasmid replicon typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
were performed on PCR-positive strains.
RESULTS: The CPE carriage rate was 1.6% (9/551) in the inpatient group and 0%
(0/936) in the healthy adults group. The numbers of strains positive for the
carbapenemase gene were 4 for Enterobacter cloacae, 2 for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 
1 for Citrobacter freundii, 1 for Raoultella ornithinolytica and 1 for
Escherichia coli. In all CPE strains, the carbapenemase gene was blaIMP-6 and the
plasmid replicon type was IncN. The 4 E. cloacae strains showed a similar pattern
in PFGE.
CONCLUSION: In the same city in Japan, CPE intestinal carriers were detected only
in the inpatient group in this study but not in a healthy adults, suggesting that
the spread of asymptomatic CPE carriers was confined to inpatients.
