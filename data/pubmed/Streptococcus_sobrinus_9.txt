OBJECTIVE: Laboratory tests are routinely used to test bonding properties of
dental adhesives. Various aging methods that simulate the oral environment are
used to complement these tests for assessment of adhesive bond durability.
However, most of these methods challenge hydrolytic and mechanical stability of
the adhesive- enamel/dentin interface, and not the biostability of dental
adhesives. To compare resin-dentin microtensile bond strength (μTBS) after a
15-day Streptococcus mutans (SM) or Streptococcus sobrinus (SS) bacterial
exposure to the 6-month water storage (WS) ISO 11405 type 3 test.
METHODOLOGY: A total of 31 molars were flattened and their exposed dentin was
restored with Optibond-FL adhesive system and Z-100 dental composite. Each
restored molar was sectioned and trimmed into four dumbbell-shaped specimens, and
randomly distributed based on the following aging conditions: A) 6 months of WS
(n=31), B) 5.5 months of WS + 15 days of a SM-biofilm challenge (n=31), C) 15
days of a SM-biofilm challenge (n=31) and D) 15 days of a SS-biofilm challenge
(n=31). μTBS were determined and the failure modes were classified using light
microscopy.
RESULTS: Statistical analyses showed that each type of aging condition affected
μTBS (p<0.0001). For Group A (49.7±15.5MPa), the mean μTBS was significantly
greater than in Groups B (19.3±6.3MPa), C (19.9±5.9MPa) and D (23.6±7.9MPa). For 
Group D, the mean μTBS was also significantly greater than for Groups B and C,
but no difference was observed between Groups B and C.
CONCLUSION: A Streptococcus mutans- or Streptococcus sobrinus-based biofilm
challenge for 15 days resulted in a significantly lower μTBS than did the ISO
11405 recommended 6 months of water storage. This type of biofilm-based aging
model seems to be a practical method for testing biostability of resin-dentin
bonding.
