Coronary artery interventions are safe procedures yet have a risk of stent
infection, bacteremia and sepsis, events that are rare but with high morbidity
and mortality sequel. A few prior cases had reported post percutaneous coronary
intervention (PCI) infections, abscesses and sepsis due to Staphylococcus aureus,
followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cardiac Actinomyces infections are extremely 
rare. Here we report a case of a 50 year old patient who developed a post
intervention Actinomyces oris epicardial abscess occluding right coronary artery 
with subsequent bacteremia eventually requiring open heart surgery. He was
treated during and thereafter with IV penicillin and ceftriaxone for almost 8
weeks. We highlight during this review the available literature regarding risk
factors, the possible theories of acquiring such bacterium at this unusual site
as well as our patient's course and treatment outcome.
