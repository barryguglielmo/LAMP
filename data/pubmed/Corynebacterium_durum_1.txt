The oral microbiome engages in a diverse array of highly sophisticated ecological
interactions that are crucial for maintaining symbiosis with the host.
Streptococci and corynebacteria are among the most abundant oral commensals and
their interactions are critical for normal biofilm development. In this study, we
discovered that Streptococcus sanguinis specifically responds to the presence of 
Corynebacterium durum by dramatically altering its chain morphology and improving
its overall fitness. By employing gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)
analysis, specific fatty acids were identified in C. durum supernatants that are 
responsible for the observed effect. Membrane vesicles (MVs) containing these
fatty acids were isolated from C. durum supernatants and were able to replicate
the chain morphology phenotype in S. sanguinis, suggesting MV as a mediator of
interspecies interactions. Furthermore, S. sanguinis responds to C. durum lipids 
by decreasing the expression of key FASII genes involved in fatty acid synthesis.
Several of these genes are also essential for the chain elongation phenotype,
which implicates a regulatory connection between lipid metabolism and chain
elongation. In addition, C. durum was found to affect the growth, cell
aggregation, and phagocytosis of S. sanguinis, revealing a complex association of
these species that likely supports oral commensal colonization and survival.
