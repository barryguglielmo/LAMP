BACKGROUND: Parietal fibrinous peritonitis (PFP) and generalised peritonitis (GP)
are two postoperative complications in cows, characterised by fluid and fibrin
accumulation throughout the peritoneum (GP) or in an encapsulated cavity (PFP).
Unlike GP, PFP is scarcely documented.
METHODS: Twenty-one GP cases and 12 PFP cases were confirmed by ultrasound in
cows referred to the Veterinary Clinic (Liège University) for complications after
caesarean section. All cows underwent a standardised examination protocol. Blood 
samples were analysed for metabolic and inflammatory markers. Bacteriology was
performed on peritoneal fluid samples. Treatment consisted of surgical drainage
of the abdominal cavity (GP) or the encapsulated cavity (PFP). Variables
concerning anamnesis, clinical findings and treatment outcomes were compared.
RESULTS: Perioperative complications had occurred in 9/21 GP cows but 0/12 PFP
cows (P<0.05). Biochemical analysis indicated pronounced inflammation and did not
differ between groups. Peritoneal fluid samples of both groups were contaminated 
and contained similar bacteria (Trueperella pyogenes and Escherichia coli). While
11/12 PFP cows were discharged, all patients with GP died or were euthanased
(P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesise that PFP and GP are two different manifestations of
perioperative peritoneal contamination. The severity and spread of the
contamination determine the clinical presentation and the prognosis.
