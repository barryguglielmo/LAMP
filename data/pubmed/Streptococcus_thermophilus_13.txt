The family of cobalamin class-III dependent enzymes is composed of the reductive 
dehalogenases (RDases) and related epoxyqueuosine reductases. RDases are crucial 
for the energy conserving process of organohalide respiration. These enzymes have
the ability to reductively cleave carbon-halogen bonds, present in a number of
environmentally hazardous pollutants, making them of significant interest for
bioremediation applications. Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain sufficient 
yields of pure RDase isolated from organohalide respiring bacteria for
biochemical studies. Hence, robust heterologous expression systems are required
that yield the active holo-enzyme which requires both iron-sulphur cluster and
cobalamin incorporation. We present a comparative study of the heterologous
expression strains Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli HMS174(DE3), Shimwellia 
blattae and a commercial strain of Vibrio natrigenes, for cobalamin class-III
dependent enzymes expression. The Nitratireductor pacificus pht-3B reductive
dehalogenase (NpRdhA) and the epoxyqueuosine reductase from Streptococcus
thermophilus (StoQ) were used as model enzymes. We also analysed whether
co-expression of the cobalamin transporter BtuB, supports increased cobalamin
incorporation into these enzymes in E. coli. We conclude that while expression in
Bacillus megaterium resulted in the highest levels of cofactor incorporation,
co-expression of BtuB in E. coli presents an appropriate balance between cofactor
incorporation and protein yield in both cases.
