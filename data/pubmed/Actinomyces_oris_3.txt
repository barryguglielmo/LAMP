Sortase enzymes are attractive antivirulence drug targets that attach virulence
factors to the surface of Staphylococcus aureus and other medically significant
bacterial pathogens. Prior efforts to discover a useful sortase inhibitor have
relied upon an in vitro activity assay in which the enzyme is removed from its
native site on the bacterial surface and truncated to improve solubility. To
discover inhibitors that are effective in inactivating sortases in vivo, we
developed and implemented a novel cell-based screen using Actinomyces oris, a key
colonizer in the development of oral biofilms. A. oris is unique because it
exhibits sortase-dependent growth in cell culture, providing a robust phenotype
for high throughput screening (HTS). Three molecules representing two unique
scaffolds were discovered by HTS and disrupt surface protein display in intact
cells and inhibit enzyme activity in vitro. This represents the first HTS for
sortase inhibitors that relies on the simple metric of cellular growth and
suggests that A. oris may be a useful platform for discovery efforts targeting
sortase.
