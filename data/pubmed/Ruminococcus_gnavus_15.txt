Selective inhibitors of gut bacterial β-glucuronidases (GUSs) are of particular
interest in the prevention of xenobiotic-induced toxicities. This study reports
the first structure-activity relationships on potency and selectivity of several 
iminocyclitols (2-7) for the GUSs. Complex structures of Ruminococcus gnavus GUS 
with 2-7 explained how charge, conformation, and substituent of iminocyclitols
affect their potency and selectivity. N1 of uronic isofagomine (2) made strong
electrostatic interactions with two catalytic glutamates of GUSs, resulting in
the most potent inhibition (Ki ≥ 11 nM). C6-propyl analogue of 2 (6) displayed
700-fold selectivity for opportunistic bacterial GUSs (Ki = 74 nM for E. coli GUS
and 51.8 μM for RgGUS). In comparison with 2, there was 200-fold enhancement in
the selectivity, which was attributed to differential interactions between the
propyl group and loop 5 residues of the GUSs. The results provide useful insights
to develop potent and selective inhibitors for undesired GUSs.
