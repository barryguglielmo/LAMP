Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae capsular genotypes K1 and K2 are common
pathogens responsible for community-acquired liver abscesses and invasive
infections especially in East Asia. We report a Japanese man with diabetes
mellitus who rapidly developed emphysematous cholecystitis and fulminant
disseminated infection with life-threatening multiple organ-system failure due to
K. pneumoniae K2 strains belonging to sequence type 65. In East Asia, clinicians 
should be aware of fulminant infections caused by hypervirulent K2 strains in
patients with community-acquired K. pneumoniae infections. Further
epidemiological studies are warranted to elucidate the clinical features
associated with the virulence K. pneumoniae K2 strains.
