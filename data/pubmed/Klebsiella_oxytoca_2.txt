OBJECTIVES: We analysed the concordance of rectal swab isolates and blood culture
for Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) isolates in neonates with a suspicion of
neonatal sepsis admitted to a neonatal care unit in Haiti.
METHODS: We matched pairs of blood and rectal samples taken on the date of
suspected sepsis onset in the same neonate. We calculated the proportion of
rectal isolates in concordance with the blood isolates by species and genus. We
calculated the negative predictive value (NPV) for GNB and extended-spectrum
β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing GNB for all rectal and blood isolate pairs in
neonates with suspected sepsis.
RESULTS: We identified 238 blood and rectal samples pairs, with 238 blood isolate
results and 309 rectal isolate results. The overall concordance in genus and
species between blood and rectal isolates was 22.3% [95% confidence interval (CI)
17.4-28.0%] and 20.6% (95% CI 16.0-26.2%), respectively. The highest concordance 
between blood and rectal isolates was observed for samples with no bacterial
growth (65%), followed byKlebsiella pneumoniae (18%) and Klebsiella oxytoca
(12%). The NPV of detecting GNB bacterial isolates in rectal samples compared
with those in blood samples was 81.6% and the NPV for ESBL-positive GNB was
92.6%.
CONCLUSIONS: The NPV of rectal swab GNB isolates was high in all patient groups
and was even higher for ESBL-positive GNB. Clinicians can use the results from
rectal swabs when taken simultaneously with blood samples during outbreaks to
inform the (de-)escalation of antibiotic therapy in those neonates that have an
ongoing sepsis profile.
