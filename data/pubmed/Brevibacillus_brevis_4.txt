Brevibacillus brevis GZDF3 is a gram-positive, plant growth-promoting rhizosphere
bacterium (PGPR) isolated from the rhizosphere soil of Pinellia ternata (an
important herb in traditional Chinese medicine). The GZDF3 strain produces
certain active compounds, such as siderophores, which are the final metabolite
products of non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and independent non-ribosomal
peptide synthetase (NIS) activity. With the present study, we attempted to
investigate the siderophore production characteristics and conditions of Bacillus
sp. GZDF3. The antibacterial activity of the siderophores on pathogenic fungi was
also investigated. Optimal conditions for the synthesis of siderophores were
determined by single factor method, using sucrose 15 g/l, asparagine 2 g/l, 32Â°C,
and 48 h. The optimized sucrose asparagine medium significantly increased the
production of siderophores, from 27.09% to 54.99%. Moreover, the effects of
different kinds of metal ions on siderophore production were explored here. We
found that Fe3+ and Cu2+ significantly inhibited the synthesis of siderophores.
The preliminary separation and purification of siderophores by immobilized-metal 
affinity chromatography (IMAC) provides strong antibacterial activity against
Candida albicans. The synergistic effect of siderophores and amphotericin B was
also demonstrated. Our results have shown that the GZDF3 strain could produce a
large amount of siderophores with strong antagonistic activity, which is helpful 
in the development of new biological control agents.
