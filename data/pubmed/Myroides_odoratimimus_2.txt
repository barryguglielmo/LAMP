Strains of the environmental bacterium Myroides odoratimimus can cause human
infections. However, treating M. odoratimimus infections can be difficult because
of multidrug resistance in this organism. In this study, we isolated strain M.
odoratimimus G13 from pastureland in Tibet, China. The minimum inhibitory
concentration analysis suggested that strain G13 has resistance to multiple
antibiotics, with an MIC for tetracycline of 168 mg/L. Whole-genome sequencing
and bioinformatic analysis revealed that the genome of G13 was rich in virulence 
factor-encoding genes and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The mobilizable
genomic island MGI1313 was also identified and characterized, and six resistance 
genes related to four types of antibiotics were annotated in MGI1313. Conjugation
assays indicated that MGI1313 could be transferred from G13 to Escherichia coli
25DN by horizontal gene transfer, resulting in multidrug-resistant E. coli
conjugants. In conclusion, multidrug-resistant M. odoratimimus G13 and the
mobility of MGI1313 raise the risk of difficult-to-treat bacterial infections and
should be under close surveillance.
