Consumption of heavy metals, especially lead (Pb) contaminated food is a serious 
threat to human health. Higher Pb uptake by the plant affects the quality, growth
and yield of crops. However, inoculation of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 
(PGPR) along with a mixture of organic amendments and biochar could be an
effective way to overcome the problem of Pb toxicity. That's why current pot
experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of compost mixed biochar (CB) 
and ACC deaminase producing PGPR on growth and yield of spinach plants under
artificially induced Pb toxicity. Six different treatments i.e., control,
Alcaligenes faecalis (PGPR1), Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (PGPR2),
compost + biochar (CB), PGPR1 + CB and PGPR2 + CB were applied under 250 mg Pb
kg-1 soil. Results showed that inoculation of PGPRs (Alcaligenes faecalis and
Bacillus amyloliquefaciens) alone and along with CB significantly enhanced root
fresh (47%) and dry weight (31%), potassium concentration (11%) in the spinach
plant. Whereas, CB + Bacillus amyloliquefaciens significantly decreased (43%) the
concentration of Pb in the spinach root over control. In conclusion,
CB + Bacillus amyloliquefaciens has the potential to mitigate the Pb induced
toxicity in the spinach. The obtained result can be further used in the planning 
and execution of rhizobacteria and compost mixed biochar-based soil amendment.
