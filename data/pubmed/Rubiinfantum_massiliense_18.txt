Members of the Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MABC) are multidrug-resistant
nontuberculous mycobacteria and cause opportunistic pulmonary infections in
individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). In this study, genomic analysis of MABC
isolates was performed to gain greater insights into the epidemiology of
circulating strains in Ireland. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on 70
MABC isolates that had been referred to the Irish Mycobacteria Reference
Laboratory between 2006 and 2017 across nine Irish health care centers. The MABC 
isolates studied comprised 52 isolates from 27 CF patients and 18 isolates from
10 non-CF patients. WGS identified 57 (81.4%) as M. abscessus subsp. abscessus,
10 (14.3%) as M. abscessus subsp. massiliense, and 3 (4.3%) as M. abscessus
subsp. bolletii Forty-nine (94%) isolates from 25 CF patients were identified as 
M. abscessus subsp. abscessus, whereas 3 (6%) isolates from 2 CF patients were
identified as M. abscessus subsp. massiliense Among the isolates from non-CF
patients, 44% (8/18) were identified as M. abscessus subsp. abscessus, 39% (7/18)
were identified as M. abscessus subsp. massiliense, and 17% (3/18) were
identified as M. abscessus subsp. bolletii WGS detected two clusters of closely
related M. abscessus subsp. abscessus isolates that included isolates from
different CF centers. There was a greater genomic diversity of MABC isolates
among the isolates from non-CF patients than among the isolates from CF patients.
Although WGS failed to show direct evidence of patient-to-patient transmission
among CF patients, there was a predominance of two different strains of M.
abscessus subsp. abscessus Furthermore, some MABC isolates were closely related
to global strains, suggesting their international spread. Future prospective
real-time epidemiological and clinical data along with contemporary MABC sequence
analysis may elucidate the sources and routes of transmission among patients
infected with MABC.
