In this paper, we reveal and characterize cross-feeding behaviour between the
common gut commensal Bacteroides cellulosilyticus (Baccell) and certain
bifidobacterial strains, including Bifidobacterium breve UCC2003, when grown on a
medium containing Larch Wood Arabinogalactan (LW-AG). We furthermore show that
cross-feeding is dependent on the release of β-1,3-galacto-di/trisaccharides
(β-1,3-GOS), and identified that the bga gene cluster of B. breve UCC2003 allows 
β-1,3-GOS metabolism. The product of bgaB is presumed to be responsible for the
import of β-1,3-GOS, while the bgaA gene product, a glycoside hydrolase family 2 
member, was shown to hydrolyse both β-1,3-galactobiose and β-1,3-galactotriose
into galactose monomers. This study advances our understanding of strain-specific
syntrophic interactions between two glycan degraders in the human gut in the
presence of AG-type dietary polysaccharides.
