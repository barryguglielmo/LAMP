Rosemary extract (RE) has significant antioxidant and antibacterial properties;
however, the application of RE to areas with an aqueous solution is limited due
to its poor solubility. There is a need for research focused on finding a method 
to improve water solubility for incorporating RE into aqueous systems, such as
food and cosmetic. Therefore, in this study, the micellar solubilization of RE is
conducted using four types of surfactants (Tween 20, polyglyceryl-10-laurate,
polyglyceryl-10-myristate, and polyglyceryl-10-monooleate) to increase the water 
solubility of RE and the effects of various surfactant types and concentration on
solubility were investigated. Antibacterial activities of the mixture solutions
containing RE and surfactants were also examined. The water solubility of RE
significantly improved when surfactants were added into the RE solution and
especially in polyglyceryl-10-monooleate, with the longest tail, was the most
effective for increasing solubility. In terms of the antibacterial effect on
Bacillus subtilis, it was observed that a relatively lower concentration of
surfactants was effective. The results of this study provide useful information
for the development of a new RE-loaded delivery system for food and cosmetic
application.
