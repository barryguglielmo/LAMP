Antimicrobial resistance is a steadily increasing problem and poses a serious
threat to global public health. Therefore, it is highly necessary to advance the 
development of novel antimicrobial compounds and semen preservation strategies.
The aim of this study was to evaluate a low temperature, antibiotic-free
preservation procedure using Androstar Premium (ASP) extender (Minitüb) with
antimicrobial lipopeptides. Firstly, seven lipopeptides in two concentrations
(1 × minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)/2 × MIC) were tested on their
sperm-compatibility at 17 °C. Two lipopeptides, C16-KKK-NH2 and C16-KKKK-NH2, did
not negatively affect sperm quality and were further evaluated for their
efficiency of bacterial growth inhibition at 5 °C. Besides an overall diminution 
of colony forming units, both peptides showed a reduction of bacterial
subcultures (n = 103) with a decrement in Gram-positive rods from 65 (ASP w/o
supplements) to 39/52 (ASP w/ C16-KKK-NH2/C16-KKKK-NH2), in Gram-positive cocci
from 21 to 9/10 and in Gram-negative species from 17 to 8/5 total subcultures.
Furthermore, lipopeptides revealed activity towards selected bacteria of
potential concern in artificial insemination like Trueperella pyogenes,
Alcaligenes faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (not C16-KKK-NH2), Pasteurella sp., 
Providencia stuartii, Escherichia coli (not C16-KKKK-NH2) and Streptococcus
porcinus (not C16-KKKK-NH2). Consequently, both tested lipopeptides are promising
candidates for alternative antibiotic-free preservation techniques of boar semen.
