The construction protocol of bio-nanocapsule (BNC)-based nanocarriers, named
GL-BNC and GL-virosome, for targeted drug delivery to macrophages is described
here. First, genes encoding the Streptococcus sp. protein G-derived C2 domain
(binds to IgG Fc) and Finegoldia magna protein L-derived B1 domain (binds to IgÎº 
light chain) are prepared by PCR amplification. Subsequently, the genes encoding 
hepatic cell-specific binding domain of hepatitis B virus envelope L protein are 
replaced by these PCR products. The expression plasmid for this fused gene
(encoding GL-fused L protein) can be used to transform Saccharomyces cerevisiae
AH22R- cells. To obtain GL-BNC, the transformed yeast cells are disrupted with
glass beads, treated with heat, and then subjected to IgG affinity column
chromatography followed by size exclusion column chromatography. In addition,
GL-BNCs can be fused with liposomes to form GL-virosome. The targeted delivery of
GL-BNC and GL-virosome to macrophages can be confirmed by in vitro phagocytosis
assays using the murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7.
