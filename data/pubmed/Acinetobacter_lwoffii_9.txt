Human microbiota play an important role in the health of their human hosts.
Recent studies have demonstrated that microbiota exist in seminal plasma. The
current study aims to elucidate whether seminal microbiota exist in patients with
different types of dysspermatism and whether bacterial biomarkers can be
identified for them. A total of 159 study participants were recruited, including 
22 patients with oligoasthenospermia, 58 patients with asthenospermia, 8 patients
with azoospermia, 13 patients with oligospermia, and 58 matched healthy controls.
Seminal microbiota composition was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing.
The results showed that the composition of seminal microbiota of patients with
dysspermatism differed from those of healthy controls. Comparison of the
microbiota composition in semen samples from patients with different types of
dysspermatism showed that microbiota in patients with asthenospermia and
oligoasthenospermia were distinct from healthy controls in beta diversity
(P < 0.05). Characteristic biomarkers, including Ureaplasma, Bacteroides,
Anaerococcus, Finegoldia, Lactobacillus and Acinetobacter lwoffii, were
identified based on LEfSe analysis. Inferred functional analysis based on seminal
microbiome data further indicated the presence of potential pathogenic biomarkers
in patients with asthenospermia and oligoasthenospermia. These results provided
profiles of seminal microbiota exhibited in different types of dysspermatism,
thus providing new insights into their pathogenesis.
