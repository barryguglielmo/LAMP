Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae (GCSD) is a Gram-positive,
facultative anaerobic bacterium and mostly non-β-haemolytic with Lancefield group
C antigen. GCSD infection has been identified in various vertebrates. From 2002
to the present, GCSD infection of fish has been reported to cause severe economic
losses in aquaculture farms around the world. Moreover, GCSD isolates from
teleosts have been identified in patients with ascending upper limb cellulitis.
Therefore, the economic and clinical significance of GCSD has increased in
aquaculture, livestock and human health. Many studies have been presented, from
the first report of isolated GCSD in fish, to the pathogenesis, characterization,
immune responses and vaccine development. In this review, we present the current 
knowledge of GCSD in teleosts.
