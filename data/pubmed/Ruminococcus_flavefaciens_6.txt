BACKGROUND: Effects of Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation products (SCFP) on
rumen microbiota were determined in vitro and in vivo under a high and a
depressed pH. The in vitro trial determined the effects of Original XPC and
NutriTek (Diamond V, Cedar Rapids, IA) at doses of 1.67 and 2.33 g/L,
respectively, on the abundances of rumen bacteria under a high pH (> 6.3) and a
depressed pH (5.8-6.0) using quantitative PCR (qPCR). In the in vivo trial eight 
rumen-cannulated lactating dairy cows were used in a cross-over design. Cows were
randomly assigned to SCFP treatments (Original XPC, Diamond V, Cedar Rapids, IA) 
or control (No SCFP) before two 5-week experimental periods. During the second
period, SCFP treatments were reversed. Cows on the SCFP treatment were
supplemented with 14 g/d of SCFP and 126 g/d of ground corn. Other cows received 
140 g/d ground corn. During the first 4 wk. of each period, cows received a basal
diet containing 153 g/kg of starch. During week 5 of both periods, the rumen pH
was depressed by a SARA challenge. This included replacing 208 g/kg of the basal 
diet with pellets of ground wheat and barley, resulting in a diet that contained 
222 g/kg DM of starch. Microbial communities in rumen liquid digesta were
examined by pyrosequencing, qPCR, and shotgun metagenomics.
RESULTS: During the in vitro experiment, XPC and NutriTek increased the relative 
abundances of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Fibrobacter succinogenes determined 
at both the high and the depressed pH, with NutriTek having the largest effect.
The relative abundances of Prevotella brevis, R. flavefaciens, ciliate protozoa, 
and Bifidobacterium spp. were increased by XPC in vivo. Adverse impacts of the in
vivo SARA challenge included reductions of the richness and diversity of the
rumen microbial community, the abundances of Bacteroidetes and ciliate protozoa
in the rumen as determined by pyrosequencing, and the predicted functionality of 
rumen microbiota as determined by shotgun metagenomics. These reductions were
attenuated by XPC supplementation.
CONCLUSIONS: The negative effects of grain-based SARA challenges on the
composition and predicted functionality of rumen microbiota are attenuated by
supplementation with SCFP.
