This study aimed to synthesize zinc nanoparticles with antimicrobial and
antioxidant activities using alternan (ZnNPs-Alt) produced by Lactobacillus
reuteri E81 as the stabilizing agent. For the characterization of the ZnNPs-Alt, 
UV-vis spectroscopy, SEM, TEM and EDX analysis, XRD, FTIR and DSC analysis were
applied. The functional role of ZnNPs-Alt was tested by determination of their
antioxidant activities by DPPH and CUPRAC methodologies and their antibacterial
and antifungal activities. Results of this study demonstrated that alternan was
utilized as a successful stabilizer to produce crystalline, thermally stabile
ZnNPs-Alt with a particle size of ∼ 100 nm. Importantly, strong antioxidant and
antimicrobial activities were observed for ZnNPs-Alt in a concentration dependent
manner. These findings confirmed the role of alternan as a stabilizing agent for 
the production of ZnNPs-Alt with functional roles.
