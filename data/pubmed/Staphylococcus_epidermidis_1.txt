Staphylococcus epidermidis is found naturally on the skin but is a common cause
of persistent orthopaedic device-related infections (ODRIs). This study used a
pan-genome and gene-by-gene approach to analyse the clonality of whole genome
sequences (WGS) of 115 S. epidermidis isolates from 55 patients with persistent
ODRIs. Analysis of the 522 gene core genome revealed that the isolates clustered 
into three clades, and MLST analysis showed that 83% of the isolates belonged to 
clonal complex 2 (CC2). Analysis also found 13 isolate pairs had different MLST
types and less than 70% similarity within the genes; hence, these were defined as
re-infection by a different S. epidermidis strain. Comparison of allelic
diversity in the remaining 102 isolates (49 patients) revealed that 6 patients
had microevolved infections (>7 allele differences), and only 37 patients (77
isolates) had a 'true' persistent infection. Analysis of the core genomes of
isolate pairs from 37 patients found 110/841 genes had variations; mainly in
metabolism associated genes. The accessory genome consisted of 2936 genes; with
an average size of 1515 genes. To conclude, this study demonstrates the advantage
of using WGS for identifying the accuracy of a persistent infection diagnosis.
Hence, persistent infections can be defined as 'true' persistent infections if
the core genome of paired isolates has ≤7 allele differences; microevolved
persistent infection if the paired isolates have >7 allele differences but same
MLST type; and polyclonal if they are the same species but a different MLST type.
