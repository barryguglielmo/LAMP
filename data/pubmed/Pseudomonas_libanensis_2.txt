During investigations of spoilage-associated meat microbiota, Pseudomonas
isolates were found in two different laboratories showing highest similarities to
Pseudomonas lactis DSM 29167T, Pseudomonas paralactis DSM 29164T and Pseudomonas 
azotoformans DSM 18862T based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons. Phylogenetic
analysis of the complete rpoB gene sequences of isolates B4-1T and SpeckC
indicated a separate branch with 99.0 and 99.1 % identity, respectively, to their
closest relative (P. lactis DSM 29167T). Further phenotypic and chemotaxonomic
characterizations, as well as average nucleotide identity (ANIb) values obtained 
from the draft genomes, revealed that these isolates could be considered as
representing a novel species, with ANIb values of around 94 and 90 % with their
closest relatives P. lactis and P. paralactis. Other related species showed ANIb 
values below 90 %, including Pseudomonas libanensis DSM 17149T, Pseudomonas
synxantha DSM 18928T, Pseudomonas orientalis DSM 17489T, Pseudomonas veronii DSM 
11331T and P. azotoformans DSM 18862T. Genome-to-genome distance calculations
between B4-1T and its closest relative, P. lactis DSM 29167T, showed 62.6 %
relatedness. The G+C contents of B4-1T and SpeckC were 59.8 and 59.9 mol%,
respectively. The major cellular lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine,
phosphatidylglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol; the major quinone was Q9. Based 
on these data, the new species Pseudomonas carnis sp. nov. is proposed, the type 
strain is B4-1T (=DSM 107652T=LMG 30892T); a second strain is SpeckC (=DSM
107651=LMG 30893).
