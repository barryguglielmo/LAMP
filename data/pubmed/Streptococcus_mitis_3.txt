No proper treatment option for peri-implantitis exists yet. Based on previous
studies showing the in vitro effectiveness of electrochemical disinfection using 
boron-doped diamond electrodes, novel double diamond electrodes (DDE) were tested
here. Using a ceramic carrier and a laser structuring process, a clinically
applicable electrode array was manufactured. Roughened metal discs (n = 24) made 
from Ti-Zr alloy were exposed to the oral cavities of six volunteers for 24 h in 
order to generate biofilm. Then, biofilm removal was carried out either using
plastic curettes and chlorhexidine digluconate or electrochemical disinfection.
In addition, dental implants were contaminated with ex vivo multispecies biofilm 
and disinfected using DDE treatment. Bacterial growth and the formation of
biofilm polymer were determined as outcome measures. Chemo-mechanical treatment
could not eliminate bacteria from roughened surfaces, while in most cases, a
massive reduction of bacteria and biofilm polymer was observed following DDE
treatment. Electrochemical disinfection was charge- and time-dependent and could 
also not reach complete disinfection in all instances. Implant threads had no
negative effect on DDE treatment. Bacteria exhibit varying resistance to
electrochemical disinfection with Bacillus subtilis, Neisseria sp.,
Rothiamucilaginosa, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Streptococcus mitis
surviving 5 min of DDE application at 6 V. Electrochemical disinfection is
promising but requires further optimization with respect to charge quantity and
application time in order to achieve disinfection without harming host tissue.
