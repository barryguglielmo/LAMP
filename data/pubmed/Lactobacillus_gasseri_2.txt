Our previous study showed a reduction of anxiety-like behavior in offspring rats 
suffered from prenatal cold stress; whether this was related to changes in the
offspring gut microbiota is unclear. To obtain the evidence for the role of the
gut microbiota in prenatal cold stress offspring, 16S rRNA sequencing technology 
was used. Male and female offspring rat feces were collected from a room
temperature group and a prenatal cold stress group (n â‰¥ 8) for microbial DNA
extraction, followed by 16S rRNA sequencing. The results indicated that prenatal 
cold stress could change the offspring's gut microbiota composition. Prenatal
cold stress significantly upregulates Lactobacillus, Lactobacillus_gasseri,
Bacteroides, and Bacteroides-acidifaciens in female offspring, whereas prenatal
cold stress significantly reduced Lachnospiraceae and Prevotellaceae in male
offspring. These data showed the characterization of gut microbiota in prenatal
cold stress offspring rats, and these data suggest that microbiological
intervention in the future can potentially prevent the negative effects caused by
cold stress to animals.
