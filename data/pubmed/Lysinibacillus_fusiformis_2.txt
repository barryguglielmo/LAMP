Background: The mangrove, Rhizophora mucronata, an essential source of endophytic
bacteria, was investigated for its ability to produce glutaminase-free
L-asparaginase. The study aimed to obtain glutaminase-free
L-asparaginase-producing endophytic bacteria from the mangrove and to optimize
enzyme production. Methods: The screening of L-asparaginase-producing bacteria
used modified M9 medium. The potential producer was further analyzed with respect
to its species using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Taguchi experimental design was
applied to optimize the enzyme production. Four factors (L-asparagine
concentration, pH, temperature, and inoculum concentration) were selected at four
levels. Results: The results indicated that the endophytic bacteria
Lysinibacillus fusiformis B27 isolated from R. mucronata was a potential producer
of glutaminase-free L-asparaginase. The experiment indicated that pH 6,
temperature at 35°C, and inoculum concentration of 1.5% enabled the best
production and were essential factors. L-asparagine (2%) was less critical for
optimum production. Conclusions: L. fusiformis B27, isolated from Rhizophora
mucronata, can be optimized for L-ASNase enzyme production using optimization
factors (L-ASNase, pH, temperature, and inoculum), which can increase L-ASNase
enzyme production by approximately three-fold.
