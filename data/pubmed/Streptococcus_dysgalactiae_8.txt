Streptococcus dysgalactiae (SD) is a common pathogen among elderly population.
However, to our knowledge, there is no periprosthetic joint infection case
reported that is infected with Streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis 
(SDSE) in the English literature. In this article, we report a 77-year-old male
patient who had undergone total knee arthroplasty three years ago and had the
diagnosis of cellulitis at his leg followed by swelling, pain and hyperemia
localized at his knee. Three knee aspirations were performed and the SDSE was
identified. There was no direct contact of patient to animals.
