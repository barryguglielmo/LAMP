AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Drug and surgical-based therapies in type 2 diabetes are
associated with altered gut microbiota architecture. Here we investigated the
role of the gut microbiome in improved glucose homeostasis following bariatric
surgery.
METHODS: We carried out gut microbiome analyses in gastrectomised (by vertical
sleeve gastrectomy [VSG]) rats of the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) non-obese model of
spontaneously occurring type 2 diabetes, followed by physiological studies in the
GK rat.
RESULTS: VSG in the GK rat led to permanent improvement of glucose tolerance
associated with minor changes in the gut microbiome, mostly characterised by
significant enrichment of caecal Prevotella copri. Gut microbiota enrichment with
P. copri in GK rats through permissive antibiotic treatment, inoculation of gut
microbiota isolated from gastrectomised GK rats, and direct inoculation of P.
copri, resulted in significant improvement of glucose tolerance, independent of
changes in body weight. Plasma bile acids were increased in GK rats following
inoculation with P. copri and P. copri-enriched microbiota from VSG-treated rats;
the inoculated GK rats then showed increased liver glycogen and upregulated
expression of Fxr (also known as Nr1h4), Srebf1c, Chrebp (also known as Mlxipl)
and Il10 and downregulated expression of Cyp7a1.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data underline the impact of intestinal P. copri on improved
glucose homeostasis through enhanced bile acid metabolism and farnesoid X
receptor (FXR) signalling, which may represent a promising opportunity for novel 
type 2 diabetes therapeutics.
