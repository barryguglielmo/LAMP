Tuberculosis is a severe, infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium
tuberculosis. The aim of this review was to present the efficacy of linezolid as 
an agent against multidrug and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis as
gathered from many recent research studies. Linezolid seems to have strongly the 
potential of being used as an anti-tuberculosis agent because it blocks bacterial
ribosomal protein synthesis. Nevertheless caution is required because of the
adverse effects it causes, especially when the linezolid daily dosage exceeds 600
mg. The most severe adverse effects include anemia, peripheral neuropathy, optic 
neuropathy and thrombocytopenia. Still, more trials and research need to be done 
in order to gather more information and value the cost-benefit dosage of the
treatment.
