Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is a rare but blinding disorder. We
present a case of a 81-year-old woman with multiple cardiovascular comorbidities 
admitted to the emergency department due to sudden, painless vision loss on left 
eye (oculus sinister (OS)) on awakening. The patient also reported long standing 
fatigue associated with effort that started 4 months before admission. She
presented best corrected visual acuity of counting fingers OS. Funduscopy OS
revealed macular oedema with cherry red spot pattern. Blood cultures came
positive for Streptococcus gallolyticus in the context of a bacteremia and native
mitral valve vegetation identified on transoesophageal echocardiography. CRAO of 
embolic origin was admitted in the context of an infective endocarditis. CRAO can
be the first manifestation of a potentially fatal systemic condition and thus
multidisciplinary approach is warranted with close collaboration between
ophthalmologists and internists in order to provide proper management and the
best possible treatment.
