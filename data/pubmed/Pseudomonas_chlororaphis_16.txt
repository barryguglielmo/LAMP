Increasing evidence shows that endophytic bacteria living inside plant tissue may
possess similar biological activity and produce similar metabolites to their
hosts. This study aimed to determine the diversity of endophytic bacteria
associated with Vernonia anthelmintica and to evaluate their biological activity.
The bacteria were isolated from the plant tissue using culture-dependent
techniques. Comparison of the 16S rRNA gene sequences of endophytic bacteria
isolated from V. anthelmintica showed that isolates belong to the species
Micrococcus endophyticus VERA1, Bacillus megaterium VERA2, Pseudomonas
chlororaphis VERA3, P. kilonensis VERA4, Stenotrophomonas pavanii VERA5, B.
endophyticus VERA6, S. maltophilia VERA7, Pantoea ananatis VERA8, B. atrophaeus
VERA9 and M. flavus VERA10. Activity studies showed that the endophytic bacteria 
share several similar biological properties with their host plant including
antimicrobial, anti-vitiligo and antidiabetic activities. These findings indicate
that plant phytochemical compounds and activity play an important role in the
physiological properties of their endophytes.
