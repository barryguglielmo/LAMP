BACKGROUND: Optimal treatment and prudent use of antimicrobials for pigs is
imperative to secure animal health and prevent development of critical
resistance. An important step in this one-health context is to monitor resistance
patterns of important animal pathogens. The aim of this study was to investigate 
the antimicrobial resistance patterns of five major pathogens in Danish pigs
during a period from 2004 to 2017 and elucidate any developments or associations 
between resistance and usage of antibiotics.
RESULTS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for Escherichia coli,
Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Streptococcus suis, Bordetella bronchiseptica,
and Staphylococcus hyicus was determined to representatives of antibiotic classes
relevant for treatment or surveillance. Escherichia coli isolates were mostly
sensitive to fluoroquinolones and colistin, whereas high levels of resistance
were observed to ampicillin, spectinomycin, streptomycin, sulfonamides and
tetracycline. While resistance levels to most compounds remained relatively
stable during the period, resistance to florfenicol increased from 2.1% in 2004
to 18.1% in 2017, likely in response to a concurrent increase in usage. A
temporal association between resistance and usage was also observed for neomycin.
E. coli serovars O138 and O149 were generally more resistant than O139. For A.
pleuropneumoniae, the resistance pattern was homogenous and predictable
throughout the study period, displaying high MIC values only to erythromycin
whereas almost all isolates were susceptible to all other compounds. Most S. suis
isolates were sensitive to penicillin whereas high resistance levels to
erythromycin and tetracycline were recorded, and resistance to erythromycin and
trimethoprim increasing over time. For S. hyicus, sensitivity to the majority of 
the antimicrobials tested was observed. However, penicillin resistance was
recorded in 69.4-88.9% of the isolates. All B. bronchiseptica isolates were
resistant to ampicillin, whereas all but two isolates were sensitive to
florfenicol. The data obtained have served as background for a recent formulation
of evidence-based treatment guidelines for pigs.
CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic resistance varied for some pathogens over time and in
response to usage. Resistance to critically important compounds was low. The
results emphasize the need for continuous surveillance of resistance patterns
also in pig pathogenic bacteria.
