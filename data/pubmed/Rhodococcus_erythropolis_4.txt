T-2 mycotoxin degradation and detoxification efficiency of seven bacterial
strains were investigated with zebrafish microinjection method in three steps
((1) determination of mycotoxin toxicity baseline, (2) examination of bacterial
metabolites toxicity, (3) identification of degradation products toxicity).
Toxicity of T-2 was used as a baseline of toxic effects, bacterial metabolites of
strains as control of bacterial toxicity and degradation products of toxin as
control of biodegradation were injected into one-cell stage embryos in the same
experiment. The results of in vivo tests were checked and supplemented with
UHPLC-MS/MS measurement of T-2 concentration of samples. Results showed that the 
Rhodococcus erythropolis NI1 strain was the only one of the seven tested (R.
gordoniae AK38, R. ruber N361, R. coprophilus N774, R. rhodochrous NI2, R.
globerulus N58, Gordonia paraffinivorans NZS14), which was appropriated to
criteria all aspects (bacterial and degradation metabolites of strains caused
lower toxicity effects than T-2, and strains were able to degrade T-2 mycotoxin).
Bacterial and degradation metabolites of the NI1 strain caused slight lethal and 
sublethal effects on zebrafish embryos at 72- and 120-h postinjection. Results
demonstrated that the three-step zebrafish microinjection method is well-suited
to the determination and classification of different bacterial strains by their
mycotoxin degradation and detoxification efficiency.
