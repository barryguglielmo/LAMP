The bacterial flagellum is the prototypical protein nanomachine and comprises a
rotating helical propeller attached to a membrane-embedded motor complex. The
motor consists of a central rotor surrounded by stator units that couple ion flow
across the cytoplasmic membrane to generate torque. Here, we present the
structures of the stator complexes from Clostridium sporogenes, Bacillus subtilis
and Vibrio mimicus, allowing interpretation of the extensive body of data on
stator mechanism. The structures reveal an unexpected asymmetric A5B2 subunit
assembly where the five A subunits enclose the two B subunits. Comparison to
structures of other ion-driven motors indicates that this A5B2 architecture is
fundamental to bacterial systems that couple energy from ion flow to generate
mechanical work at a distance and suggests that such events involve rotation in
the motor structures.
