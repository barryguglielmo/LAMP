Recent evidences indicate that mitochondrial genes and function are decreased in 
active ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, in particular, the activity of Complex I
of the electron transport chain is heavily compromised. MCJ is a mitochondrial
inner membrane protein identified as a natural inhibitor of respiratory chain
Complex I. The induction of experimental colitis in MCJ-deficient mice leads to
the upregulation of Timp3 expression resulting in the inhibition of TACE activity
that likely inhibits Tnf and Tnfr1 shedding from the cell membrane in the colon. 
MCJ-deficient mice also show higher expression of Myd88 and Tlr9, proinflammatory
genes and disease severity. Interestingly, the absence of MCJ resulted in
distinct microbiota metabolism and composition, including a member of the gut
community in UC patients, Ruminococcus gnavus. These changes provoked an effect
on IgA levels. Gene expression analyses in UC patients showed decreased levels of
MCJ and higher expression of TIMP3, suggesting a relevant role of mitochondrial
genes and function among active UC. The MCJ deficiency disturbs the regulatory
relationship between the host mitochondria and microbiota affecting disease
severity. Our results indicate that mitochondria function may be an important
factor in the pathogenesis. All together support the importance of MCJ regulation
during UC.
