Background: American Foulbrood (AFB) is a devastating disease of honey bee (Apis 
mellifera) larvae caused by the spore-forming, Gram-positive bacterium
Paenibacillus larvae. In most countries, the law requires mandatory reporting of 
AFB to the veterinary authority.
Aim and Methods: To speed up detection and genotyping of P. larvae spores, we
compared different culturing protocols on Columbia sheep blood agar and developed
a new multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction to distinguish between the
two relevant P. larvae genotypes enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus 
(ERIC) I and ERIC II.
Results and Conclusion: As confirmed by P. larvae reference strains and field
isolates, the new identification and genotyping protocol halves the time of
current workflows, lessens labor-intension, allows a higher throughput of samples
for monitoring, and permits a faster intervention to prevent the spread of AFB.
