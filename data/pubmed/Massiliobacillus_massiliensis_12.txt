Strain Marseille-P2082, an anaerobic, non-motile, asporogenous, Gram-negative,
coccoid bacterium was isolated from the faeces of a 33 year-old obese French
woman before bariatric surgery. The isolate exhibits 98.65% 16S rRNA gene
nucleotide sequence similarity with Negativicoccus succinicivorans strain ADV
07/08/06-B-1388T, its current closest phylogenetic neighbour with standing in
nomenclature. However, the dDDH relatedness between the new isolate and N.
succinicivorans type strain ADV 07/08/06-B-1388T is 52.5 ± 2.7%. Strain
Marseille-P2082 has a genome of 1,360,589 bp with a 51.1% G+C content. Its major 
fatty acids were identified as C18:1n9, C18:0 and C16:0. Based on its phenotypic,
genomic and phylogenetic characteristics, strain Marseille-P2082T [= CSURP2082
(Collection de Souches de l'Unité des Rickettsies) = DSM 100853] is proposed as
the type strain of the novel species Negativicoccus massiliensis sp. nov. The 16S
rRNA gene sequence and whole-genome shotgun sequence have been deposited in
EMBL-EBI under accession numbers LN876651 and LT700188, respectively.
