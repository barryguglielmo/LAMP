Introduction: Neisseria elongata, which is part of the normal oropharyngeal
bacterial flora, can be an aggressive organism causing serious infections
including infective endocarditis. N. elongata infective endocarditis is rare and 
no current guidelines exist to direct antibiotic selection and/or duration of
treatment.
Case report: We report a case of infective endocarditis due to N. elongata and a 
review of the literature. Our patient is a healthy young woman, who was found to 
have an aortic root abscess with valve perforation requiring valve replacement.
Discussion: N. elongata infective endocarditis typically affects the left cardiac
chambers and is associated with high risk of embolization. A transesophageal
echocardiogram should be performed as part of the initial workup to assess the
extent of infection, as a high percentage of patients develop perivalvular
abscess formation and/or valve perforation. Most patients require prolonged
antibiotic therapy and early surgical intervention.
Conclusions: This case demonstrates the potential severity of N. elongata
endocarditis. Further studies are needed to establish management guidance.
