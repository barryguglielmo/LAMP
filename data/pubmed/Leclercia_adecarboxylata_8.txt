We report a multidrug-resistant strain of Leclercia adecarboxylata which was
responsible for a catheter-related bacteremia, in a 50-year-old female with an
end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. The isolated strain was an extended
beta-lactamase producer. Based on a literature review of L. adecarboxylata, there
have been only two reports of extended beta-lactamase producer strains. To our
knowledge, this is the first case reported in Saudi Arabia.
