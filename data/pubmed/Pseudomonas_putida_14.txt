BACKGROUND: In silico promoter prediction represents an important challenge in
bioinformatics as it provides a first-line approach to identifying regulatory
elements to support wet-lab experiments. Historically, available promoter
prediction software have focused on sigma factor-associated promoters in the
model organism E. coli. As a consequence, traditional promoter predictors yield
suboptimal predictions when applied to other prokaryotic genera, such as
Pseudomonas, a Gram-negative bacterium of crucial medical and biotechnological
importance.
RESULTS: We developed SAPPHIRE, a promoter predictor for σ70 promoters in
Pseudomonas. This promoter prediction relies on an artificial neural network that
evaluates sequences on their similarity to the - 35 and - 10 boxes of σ70
promoters found experimentally in P. aeruginosa and P. putida. SAPPHIRE currently
outperforms established predictive software when classifying Pseudomonas σ70
promoters and was built to allow further expansion in the future.
CONCLUSIONS: SAPPHIRE is the first predictive tool for bacterial σ70 promoters in
Pseudomonas. SAPPHIRE is free, publicly available and can be accessed online at
www.biosapphire.com . Alternatively, users can download the tool as a Python 3
script for local application from this site.
