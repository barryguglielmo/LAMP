Neonatal cholestasis disease (NCD) is a complex and easily mis-diagnosed
condition. We analyzed microbiota community structure in feces and measured
short-chain fatty acids, bile acids (BAs) and liver function of 12 healthy, 13
NCD, and 13 treated infants after diagnosis. Based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon
sequencing and gas-chromatographic-mass-spectrometric analysis of secondary BAs, 
we identified microbial genera and metabolites that associate with abnormal bile 
secretion. Streptococcus gallolyticus and Parabacteroides distasonis, and
Lactobacillus gasseri had higher relative abundance in healthy and NCD infants
respectively. Compared to NCD patients, healthy infants had higher LCA, CDCA and 
GCDCA fecal concentrations. The three microbial species and three secondary bile 
acids were selected as potential non-invasive combined biomarkers to diagnose
NCD. We propose that microbiota-metabolite combined biomarkers could be used for 
diagnosis of NCD, and this may contribute to improved early clinical diagnosis of
NCD in the future.
