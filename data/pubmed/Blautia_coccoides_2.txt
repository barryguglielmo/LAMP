Members of the gut microbiota are thought to experience strong competition for
nutrients. However, how such competition shapes their evolutionary dynamics and
depends on intra- and interspecies interactions is poorly understood. Here, we
test the hypothesis that Escherichia coli evolution in the mouse gut is more
predictable across hosts in the absence of interspecies competition than in the
presence of other microbial species. In support, we observed that lrp, a gene
encoding a global regulator of amino acid metabolism, was repeatedly selected in 
germ-free mice 2 weeks after mono-colonization by this bacterium. We established 
that this specific genetic adaptation increased E. coli's ability to compete for 
amino acids, and analysis of gut metabolites identified serine and threonine as
the metabolites preferentially consumed by E. coli in the mono-colonized mouse
gut. Preference for serine consumption was further supported by testing a set of 
mutants that showed loss of advantage of an lrp mutant impaired in serine
metabolism in vitro and in vivo. Remarkably, the presence of a single additional 
member of the microbiota, Blautia coccoides, was sufficient to alter the gut
metabolome and, consequently, the evolutionary path of E. coli. In this
environment, the fitness advantage of the lrp mutant bacteria is lost, and
mutations in genes involved in anaerobic respiration were selected instead,
recapitulating the eco-evolutionary context from mice with a complex microbiota. 
Together, these results highlight the metabolic plasticity and evolutionary
versatility of E. coli, tailored to the specific ecology it experiences in the
gut.
