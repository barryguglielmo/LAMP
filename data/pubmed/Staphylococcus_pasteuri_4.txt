The expression and purification of melittin (MET) in microbials are difficult
because of its antibacterial activities. In this work, MET was fused with a
glutathione-S-transferase (GST) tag and expressed in Escherichia coli to overcome
its lethality to host cells. The fusion protein GST-MET was highly expressed and 
then purified by glutathione sepharose high-performance affinity chromatography, 
digested with prescission protease, and further purified by Superdex Peptide
10/300 GL chromatography. Finally, 3.5 mg/L recombinant melittin (rMET) with a
purity of >90% was obtained; its antibacterial activities against Gram-positive
Bacillus pumilus and Staphylococcus pasteuri were similar to those of commercial 
MET. A circular dichroism spectroscopic assay showed that the rMET peptide
secondary structure was similar to those of the commercial form. To our
knowledge, this is the report of the preparation of active pure rMET with no
tags. The successful expression and purification of rMET will enable large-scale,
industrial biosynthesis of MET.
