To develop a new antiviral preparation from a microbial source, the halophilic
bacterium Bacillus pumilus E303035 was isolated from a soil sample collected at
Qarhan Salt Lake in Qinghai, China. The inhibitory activity of an ethyl acetate
extract of its fermentation broth was higher than that of an n-butanol extract.
After isolation and purification, 9 compounds were obtained: cyclo(L-Leu-L-Pro)
(1), cyclo(L-Pro-L-Tyr) (2), Brevianamide F (3), 2-(3-Indolyl) ethanol (4),
N-[2-(1H-indol-3-yl) ethyl] acetamide (5), 3, 3-di(1H-indol-3-yl)propane-1,2-diol
(6), Lincomycin B (7), dibutylphthalate (8), and p-hydroxyphenethyl alcohol (9). 
Compounds 1, 5, and 9 showed inhibitory activities against potato virus Y (PVY). 
Compounds 1, 4, and 9 had significant inhibitory activity against genes HC-pro,
P3, and Nib, compound 5 against gene P3, and compounds 1 and 4 against NIa.
Compounds 1, 4, 5, and 9 had significant inhibitory activity against genes VPg
and 6K1. Active compounds 1, 5, and 9 had various effects on the expression of
viral genes related to pathogenesis. Expression of genes cullin and XTH was
up-regulated and CP was down-regulated, compared to the positive control. In
conclusion, compounds 1, 5, and 9 might be considered as potential antiviral
agents for future development.
