Considering the amount of time that crew members and passengers spend on
airliners and the potential health impact of pathogenic bacteria, it is important
to understand the population of bacteria inside airliners and the factors
affecting the bacterial concentration. This study recorded the species of
airborne and cabin surface culturable bacteria inside various airliner. Seven
flights ranging from 3 to 5Â hours in duration on different types of airliner were
chosen. Multiple species of bacteria in the air of the airliners, such as
Brachybacterium paraconglomeratum, were identified by means of the 16S ribosomal 
RNA gene sequencing method, and most of the bacteria were Gram-positive. This
study found that the bacterial concentration in the airliners decreases as the
relative humidity increases. The decrease in the number of airborne bacteria may 
be the reason for the reduced occurrence of unwanted symptoms exhibited by
passengers.
