Tambaqui Colossoma macropomum is the most produced native fish in South America. 
Besides the lack of knowledge regarding bacteria-stricken diseases, the
unappropriated using of off-label therapies are common. In this study, Aeromonas 
hydrophila pathogenicity for tambaqui was first established by Koch's Postulate. 
Lethal doses (LD) were settled for investigation of clinical signs and mortality.
The antimicrobial activities were investigated by disk-diffusion test against 11 
antibiotics and by broth microdilution methods against 3 antibiotics, 7
disinfectants and 11 herbal medicines. LD experiment showed up to 80% of fish
mortality, skin darkness, ulcers, hemorrhage, lethargy and hypo/anorexia in all
groups, with exception of control. The LD10,50,90 and 99 were established in
4.1 × 107, 8.8 × 107, 1.9 × 108 e 3.6 × 108 CFU/mL, respectively. Ceftriaxone,
florfenicol, oxytetracycline and thiamphenicol were considered promising against 
A. hydrophila. All herbal medicines were classified as bactericides, but clove
Eugenia caryophyllata and cinnamon Cinnamomum zeylanicum displayed strongest
activities. Among disinfectants, malachite green was the only that did not
present acceptable values, discouraging its use. In conclusion, Koch's postulate 
was fulfilled and tambaqui entered to the vast list of A. hydrophila hosts and
promising results of chemical substances were provided, contributing to motile
Aeromonas septicemia (MAS) control.
