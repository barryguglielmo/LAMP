Streptococcus canis is a zoonotic agent that causes serious invasive diseases in 
domestic animals and humans, but knowledge about its pathogenic potential and
underlying virulence mechanisms is limited. Here, we report on the ability of
certain S. canis isolates to form large bacterial aggregates when grown in liquid
broth. Bacterial aggregation was attributed to the presence and the self-binding 
activity of SCM, the M protein of S. canis, as evaluated by bacterial
sedimentation assays, immunofluorescence- and electron microscopic approaches.
Using a variety of truncated recombinant SCM fragments, we demonstrated that
homophilic SCM interactions occur via the N-terminal, but not the C-terminal
part, of the mature M protein. Interestingly, when incubated in human plasma, SCM
forms soluble protein complexes comprising its known ligands, immunoglobulin G
(IgG) and plasminogen (Plg). Co-incubation studies with purified host proteins
revealed that SCM-mediated complex formation is based on the interaction of SCM
with itself and with IgG, but not with Plg or fibrinogen (Fbg), well-established 
constituents of M protein-mediated protein complexes in human-associated
streptococci. Notably, these soluble, SCM-mediated plasma complexes harbored
complement factor C1q, which can induce complement breakdown in the periphery and
therefore represent another immune evasion mechanism of SCM.
