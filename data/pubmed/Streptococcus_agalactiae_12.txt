To assess the incidence, clinical, microbiological features and outcome of
invasive Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS) infections in non-pregnant adults in
three tertiary hospitals of the Brussels-Capital Region. All bacterial cultures
positive for GBS, from 2005 to 2019 from 3 hospitals of the Brussels-Capital
Region, were extracted, and only cases of invasive diseases were included.
Medical files were retrospectively retrieved for risk factors, clinical
manifestations and outcome and also antibiotic-susceptibility testing and GBS
serotypes. Incidence rates were calculated based on the hospitals catchment
populations. A total of 337 cases of GBS-invasive infections were included. The
incidence of invasive GBS for the 3 hospitals increased from 3.7 to 8.2 cases per
100.000 inhabitants between 2009 and 2018 (p = 0.04). The most frequently
identified risk factors were diabetes (36.8%), obesity (35.0%), cancer (21.7%),
renal disease (20.8%), and advanced age (≥ 65 years; 47.2%). Isolated bacteremia 
(22%), osteoarticular infection (21.4%), abscesses (13.9%), and skin and soft
tissue infections (18.4%) were the most frequent manifestations. Intensive care
unit admission was required in 21.7% and overall mortality was 9.4%. All strains 
remained susceptible to penicillin over the years. Up to 20% of strains were
resistant to clindamycin. Serotypes Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, and V represented 96.8% 
of the available serotypes (60/62). As reported in several countries, invasive
GBS disease in non-pregnant adults represents an increasing burden, particularly 
among diabetic, obese, and elderly patients. Almost all serotypes identified are 
included in the upcoming hexavalent GBS conjugate vaccine.
