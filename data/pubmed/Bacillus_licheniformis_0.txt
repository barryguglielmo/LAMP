At the International Space Station (ISS), artificial living conditions are
created and maintained to satisfy human needs, these conditions are also
favorable for the growth of numerous microorganisms, molds and bacteria. Among
the microorganisms detected on the ISS are those from the automicroflora of crew 
members, and a significant number of spore-forming bacteria. In most cases, this 
group of microorganisms gives rise to strains that are able to colonize, grow and
reproduce on interior materials and equipment of stations, and may be involved in
biodestructive processes. These bacteria show increased resistance to various
stress factors, for example, DNA-damaging and oxidizing agents. The molecular
mechanisms of this resistance to stress are poorly understood. As part of the
sanitary-microbiological monitoring of the ISS habitat, the Bacillus
licheniformis 24 strain was isolated. Here, we demonstrated that this strain has 
increased resistance to hydrogen peroxide and Paraquat when compared to the
"terrestrial" B. licheniformis B-10956 strain. B. licheniformis 24 overexpressed 
genes encoding enzymes that neutralize reactive oxygen species, such as KatX
catalase and the superoxide dismutases SodA and SodF. Apart from this, in
comparison with B. licheniformis B-10956, of B. licheniformis 24 cells had lower 
hydrogen sulfide production that was associated with sharply reduced expression
of the cysIJ operon that encodes sulfite reductase. The results indicate that
enzymatic antioxidant protective systems make a more significant contribution to 
the hyper-resistance of Bacillus strains to oxidizing agents than components of
non-enzymatic systems, such as hydrogen sulfide.
