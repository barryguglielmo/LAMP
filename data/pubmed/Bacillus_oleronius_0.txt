Rosacea is a complex facial skin condition associated with abnormal inflammation 
and vascular dysfunction. Next to the known trigger factors, the role of
microbiota in the development and aggravation of rosacea continues to raise
interest. Demodex folliculorum mites, Helicobacter pylori, Staphylococcus
epidermidis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and the Demodex-associated bacterium, Bacillus
oleronius are microbes that have been linked with rosacea. However, the results
of studies which assessed their involvement in the disease have been inconsistent
and inconclusive. Microbiological research in many different disciplines exploded
in recent years as methods to analyze complex microbial communities at the
taxonomic and phylogenetic levels became available. Here, we provide an update on
the microorganisms implicated in rosacea and review the potential pathogenic role
of microbes in the development of rosacea.
