Ageing is the single greatest cause of disease and death worldwide, and
understanding the associated processes could vastly improve quality of life.
Although major categories of ageing damage have been identified-such as altered
intercellular communication, loss of proteostasis and eroded mitochondrial
function1-these deleterious processes interact with extraordinary complexity
within and between organs, and a comprehensive, whole-organism analysis of ageing
dynamics has been lacking. Here we performed bulk RNA sequencing of 17 organs and
plasma proteomics at 10 ages across the lifespan of Mus musculus, and integrated 
these findings with data from the accompanying Tabula Muris Senis2-or 'Mouse
Ageing Cell Atlas'-which follows on from the original Tabula Muris3. We reveal
linear and nonlinear shifts in gene expression during ageing, with the associated
genes clustered in consistent trajectory groups with coherent biological
functions-including extracellular matrix regulation, unfolded protein binding,
mitochondrial function, and inflammatory and immune response. Notably, these gene
sets show similar expression across tissues, differing only in the amplitude and 
the age of onset of expression. Widespread activation of immune cells is
especially pronounced, and is first detectable in white adipose depots during
middle age. Single-cell RNA sequencing confirms the accumulation of T cells and B
cells in adipose tissue-including plasma cells that express immunoglobulin
J-which also accrue concurrently across diverse organs. Finally, we show how gene
expression shifts in distinct tissues are highly correlated with corresponding
protein levels in plasma, thus potentially contributing to the ageing of the
systemic circulation. Together, these data demonstrate a similar yet asynchronous
inter- and intra-organ progression of ageing, providing a foundation from which
to track systemic sources of declining health at old age.
