Respiratory bacterial microbiota plays a key role in human health. Lung cancer
microbiome is a significant yet an understudied area while bronchiectasis
microbiome is often studied. We assessed the bacterial microbiota in the upper
and lower respiratory tract of the patients with lung cancer and bronchiectasis
against a healthy group and their variations in individuality. 16S rRNA gene
based metagenomic sequencing was used to detect entire bacterial community along 
with conventional aerobic bacterial culturing. In comparison to healthy,
increased bacterial diversity was observed in diseased population. Abundance of
more than 1% was considered and bacteria were identified in 97% similarity. Only 
lung cancer patients exhibited bacteria specific to the disease: Corynebacterium 
tuberculostearicum and Keratinibaculum paraultunense. However, Enterococcus
faecalis and Delftia tsuruhatensis were also observed limited to lung cancer and 
bronchiectasis respectively, in less than 1% but supported with bacterial
culturing. In conclusion the disease condition and intra-group variability should
be considered in future with larger cohorts to understand individual patient
variability highlighting the social habits and gender of the individual.
