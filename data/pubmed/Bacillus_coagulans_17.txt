In this placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial, we have investigated the
effect of multi-strain probiotic (Bacillus coagulans Unique IS2, Lactobacillus
rhamnosus UBLR58, Bifidobacterium lactis UBBLa70, Lactobacillus plantarum UBLP40 
(each of 2 billion CFU); Bifidobacterium breve UBBr01, Bifidobacterium infantis
UBBI01 (each of 1 billion CFU)) capsule with glutamine (250 mg) on students
facing examination stress. A total of 80 students (18-24 years) were enrolled and
randomised to receive multi-strain probiotic or placebo capsules twice a day for 
28 days (i.e. pre- and during examination). The stress was analysed at the
baseline and the end of the treatment by using the perceived stress scale (PSS), 
depression anxiety stress scale (DASS), and state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) 
questionnaire. The serum cortisol levels were also determined. As a result, at
the end of the trial, a total of 74 students completed the study, and those who
consumed probiotic capsules showed a significant reduction in PSS, DASS, and STAI
scores, and serum cortisol levels from the baseline as compared with placebo. No 
adverse events were reported during the study. In conclusion, the multi-strain
probiotic is effective in reducing stress associated with examination.
