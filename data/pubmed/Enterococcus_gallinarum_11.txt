Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a chronic cholestatic liver disease, whose
pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Several studies have shown that PSC
patients harbor an impaired gut microbiota. A recent study confirmed that PSC
patients displayed a bacterial dysbiosis, characterized by an increased abundance
of three different bacteria: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and
Enterococcus gallinarum. This study also provides evidence for a possible
mechanism of action of these bacteria: notably the formation of pores in gut
epithelium leading to an increased gut permeability and the induction of liver
inflammation characterized by an increased proportion of T helper 17 (TH17)
cells. For the first time, strong data demonstrate not only an association
between gut microbiota and primary sclerosing cholangitis but also a possible
causal link.
