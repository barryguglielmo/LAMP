The broad spectrum of health benefits attributed to probiotics has contributed to
a rapid increase in the value of the probiotic market. Probiotic health benefits 
can be strain specific. Thus, strain-level identification of probiotic strains is
of paramount importance to ensure probiotic efficacy. Both Lactobacillus gasseri 
BNR17 and Lactobacillus reuteri LRC (NCIMB 30242) strains have clinically proven 
health benefits; however, no assays were developed to enable strain-level
identification of either of these strains. The objective of this study is to
develop strain-specific PCR-based methods for Lactobacillus gasseri BNR17 and
Lactobacillus reuteri LRC strains, and to validate these assays according to the 
guidelines for validating qualitative real-time PCR assays. Using RAST (Rapid
Annotation using Subsystem Technology), unique sequence regions were identified
in the genome sequences of both strains. Probe-based assays were designed and
validated for specificity, sensitivity, efficiency, repeatability, and
reproducibility. Both assays were specific to target strain with 100% true
positive and 0% false positive rates. Reaction efficiency for both assays was in 
the range of 90 to 108% with R square values > 0.99. Repeatability and
reproducibility were evaluated using five samples at three DNA concentrations
each and relative standard deviation was < 4% for repeatability and < 8% for
reproducibility. Both of the assays developed and validated in this study for the
specific identification of Lactobacillus gasseri BNR17 and Lactobacillus reuteri 
LRC strains are specific, sensitive, and precise. These assays can be applied to 
evaluate and ensure compliance in probiotic products.
