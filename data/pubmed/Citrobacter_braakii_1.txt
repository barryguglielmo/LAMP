Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Enterobacteriaceae have
become widespread in hospitals and the environment. Here, we describe a bla
KPC-2-carrying plasmid called pCRE3-KPC, which was recovered from a clinical
multidrug-resistant Citrobacter braakii CRE3 strain in China. The complete
nucleotide sequence of pCRE3-KPC was determined by combining MiSeq and MinION
sequencing and then compared with those of three related plasmids. Plasmid
conjugal transfer and electroporation tests, modified carbapenem inactivation
method, and bacterial antimicrobial susceptibility test were carried out. We
compared this plasmid with three related plasmids to verify that the backbone of 
pCRE3-KPC was composed of the backbones of the IncR plasmid and IncP6 plasmid.
Further bioinformatics analysis showed that pCRE3-KPC carried two
resistance-related regions (the bla KPC-2 gene cluster and the aacC2-tmrB-related
region). The aacC2-tmrB-related region included two novel insertion sequences
(ISCfr28 and ISCfr16).IMPORTANCE Reports of human-pathogenic C. braakii strains, 
especially of strains showing resistance to carbapenems, are rare. To the best of
our knowledge, our results represent the first detection of carbapenemase gene
bla KPC-2 in C. braakii strains. In addition, we have studied detailed genetic
characteristics of the novel IncR/IncP6 hybrid plasmid pCRE3-KPC, which was
isolated from a clinical multidrug-resistant Citrobacter braakii CRE3 strain. Our
results may provide further insight into the horizontal transfer of multidrug
resistance genes in bacteria and into the genomic diversity and molecular
evolution of plasmids.
