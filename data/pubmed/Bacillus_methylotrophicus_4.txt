Induced Disease Resistance and Promotion of Shallot Growth by <i>Bacillus
velezensis</i> B-27.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Shallot is a vegetable crop with high economic value, 
but its productivity is still relatively low due to various limitations. One of
the most hampering factors is moler disease and purple blotch disease caused by
Fusarium sp. and Alternaria porri, respectively. Numerous efforts have been made 
to control these diseases either using chemical fungicides or through improvement
of resistant cultivar. This study aimed to determine moler and purple disease
suppression and improvement of plant growth by Bacillus as Plant Growth Promoting
Rhizobacteria (PGPR) on shallot.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Molecular identification of Bacillus was performed by
partial gyrB gene sequencing using universal gyrB-F/gyrB-R primers. Field
observation and experiments were performed using completely randomized factorial 
block design single factor with 3 blocks for replication.
RESULTS: The partial gyrB gene sequences showed high similarity between Bacillus 
isolate B-27 and Bacillus velezensis. The application of Bacillus isolate B-27 to
shallots was shown to reduce the intensity of moler and purple blotch diseases by
67%. On top of that, Bacillus isolate B-27 increased the plant height up to 27.12
cm, the number of leaves up to 23 blades, tillers up to 8 bulbs and the tuber
weight during harvest time up to 33.64 kg.
CONCLUSION: Molecular identification based on partial gyrB gene sequence analysis
suggested that Bacillus isolate B-27 has close relationship with Bacillus
velezensis. Besides, the application of Bacillus isolate B-27 on shallot could
reduce the disease intensity and increase height, number of tillers and plant
yield significantly.
