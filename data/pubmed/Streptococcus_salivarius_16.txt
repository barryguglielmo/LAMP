Cationic hydrogels with amino groups were successfully prepared using
(1→3)-α-d-glucan synthesized by glucosyltransferase J (GtfJ) cloned from
Streptococcus salivarius through a three-step reaction: (i) Azido groups were
regioselectively introduced at the C6 position of (1→3)-α-d-glucan by a
bromination-azidation process (degree of substitution 0.94), (ii) Azido groups
were partially crosslinked with 1,8-nonadiyne via a copper(I)-catalyzed
azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction, (iii) Azido groups that were unused 
for crosslinking were reduced to amino groups by sodium borohydride (NaBH4). The 
introduction of amino groups was confirmed quantitatively and qualitatively by
elemental, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) analyses. These cationic hydrogels showed a specific adsorption ability for
bovine serum albumin (BSA) over a wide pH range of 4.5-8.0 due to their high pH
values at the point of zero charge (pHpzc 8.80-8.92).
