The use of microorganisms capable of mediating the bioprecipitation process can
be an important application in the self-healing processes of cement specimens.
Thus, the present study identified and evaluated five Bacillus strains for
potential application in the protocol of self-healing via bioprecipitation. Cell 
growth, enzyme production, and kinetic parameters conditions were evaluated
during the fermentation process. Based on the analysis of 16S rDNA in conjunction
with biochemical testing, results demonstrate that the strains are either
Bacillus cereus or Bacillus thuringiensis. Strategically it was found that the
addition of glycerol to fermentative medium was essential to increase the
bacterial concentration (≈ 4.2 × 107 cells mL-1) and production of the enzyme
urease (≈ 3.623,2 U.mL-1). The addition of this medium after 40 days of
fermentation promoted the self-healing of cracks and increased compressive
strength in ≈ 14.2% of the cementitious specimens; therefore, increasing the
sustainability and engineering properties of cement-based materials.
