Septic arthritis due to Clostridium species is rare. We report the first case of 
Clostridium paraputrificum native shoulder septic arthritis and osteomyelitis. An
86-year-old woman with osteoarthritis presented with acute-onset right shoulder
pain. Injection of the glenohumeral joint with methylprednisolone resulted in
worsening of pain. Synovial fluid analysis was consistent with septic arthritis
and culture of the synovial fluid grew C. paraputrificum. Arthroscopic irrigation
and debridement of shoulder joint with 6 weeks of ertapenem was unsuccessful,
with persistence of C. paraputrificum from synovial fluid and tissue culture. She
underwent right shoulder resection followed by a second course of ertapenem for 6
weeks. She was pain free at 12 months follow-up visit.
