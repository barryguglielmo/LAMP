BACKGROUND: Subdural empyema (SDE) is a well-known entity in pediatric
populations and is associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Large 
scale evacuation of empyema, although effective, places the bone flap at risk of 
failure when replaced.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 19-year-old man with a history of a
shunted left middle fossa cyst presenting with a panhemispheric SDE after removal
of his cystoperitoneal shunt by an outside facility. Extensive evacuation was
performed via the patients prior parietal shunt incision after expansion of the
preexisting burr hole. Cultures grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus 
and Propionibacterium acnes, and he was treated with long-term antibiotics. The
patient had a complete recovery with persistent empyema resolution on 6-month
follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic-assisted burr hole evacuation of large panhemispheric and
loculated SDE is feasible, effective, and safe. The primary advantage over
conventional open evacuations is that it negates the need for a bone flap and its
potential complications related to a secondary infection.
