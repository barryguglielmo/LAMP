PURPOSE: Skin tears are an unpleasant complication that may occur after
collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH) administration to treat Dupuytren
contractures of the fingers. The purpose of this study was to determine risk
factors for the development of this complication.
METHODS: Over a 6-year period, patients with a measurable metacarpophalangeal or 
proximal interphalangeal joint Dupuytren contracture and a palpable cord treated 
with CCH were prospectively observed. Patients were assessed for the development 
of skin tears immediately on the day of manipulation as well 30 days or more
after manipulation.
RESULTS: A total of 117 patients (174 cords) met inclusion criteria. There was a 
25.6% incidence of skin tears (30 of 117 patients; 33 skin tears). Multivariable 
regression analysis revealed that patients with a combined digital flexion
contracture (total combined metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, and
distal interphalangeal joint contracture) of 75° and greater and those treated
with 2 simultaneous doses of CCH in the same hand were more likely to sustain a
tear. All skin tears healed with nonsurgical management at short-term follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Although a relatively minor complication, skin tears are not
well-tolerated by all patients and may change the postinjection course of
orthosis use, wound care, and manual activity. Based on these results, patients
with digital contractures 75° or greater and those treated with 2 simultaneous
doses of CCH in the same hand may be counseled that they have a higher likelihood
of developing a skin tear during manipulation. Pretreatment education may reduce 
anxiety experienced by patients who otherwise unexpectedly develop a skin tear at
the time of manipulation.
TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic II.
