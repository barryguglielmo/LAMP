Infection with Bordetella bronchiseptica (Bb), a pathogen involved in canine
infectious respiratory disease complex, can be confirmed using culture or qPCR.
Studies about the canine lung microbiota (LM) are recent, sparse, and only one
paper has been published in canine lung infection. In this study, we aimed to
compare the LM between Bb infected and healthy dogs, and to correlate sequencing 
with culture and qPCR results. Twenty Bb infected dogs diagnosed either by qPCR
and/or culture and 4 healthy dogs were included. qPCR for Mycoplasma cynos (Mc)
were also available in 18 diseased and all healthy dogs. Sequencing results,
obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid after DNA extraction, PCR targeting
the V1-V3 region of the 16S rDNA and sequencing, showed the presence of Bb in all
diseased dogs, about half being co-infected with Mc. In diseased compared with
healthy dogs, the β-diversity changed (P = 0.0024); bacterial richness and
α-diversity were lower (P = 0.012 and 0.0061), and bacterial load higher
(P = 0.004). Bb qPCR classes and culture results correlated with the abundance of
Bb (r = 0.71, P < 0.001 and r = 0.70, P = 0.0022). Mc qPCR classes also
correlated with the abundance of Mc (r = 0.73, P < 0.001). Bb infection induced
lung dysbiosis, characterized by high bacterial load, low richness and diversity 
and increased abundance of Bb, compared with healthy dogs. Sequencing results
highly correlate with qPCR and culture results showing that sequencing can be
reliable to identify microorganisms involved in lung infectious diseases.
