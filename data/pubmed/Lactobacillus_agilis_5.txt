Gastrointestinal colonisation by commensal microbiota is essential for the health
and well-being of the host. We aimed to evaluate the influence of a reduced
bacterial load environment on microbiota development and maturation, and the
possibility of targeted colonisation via at-hatch administration of a selected
bacterial strain. Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) were inoculated within 1 h
of hatch with a freshly grown culture of a Lactobacillus agilis isolate derived
from a healthy adult quail. Hatchlings were kept in a mouse isolator for one week
and then housed between one and four weeks of age, with a flock of normally grown
adult quail to expose the bacteria-restricted birds to normal commensal quail
bacteria. The bacterial isolate used to inoculate the birds was found to
completely dominate the microbiota of the intestine of L.agilis at-hatch
inoculated birds. Despite 3 weeks of co-housing of the test birds with an adult
flock harbouring normal rich gut microbiota, neither the Lactobacillus inoculated
nor PBS inoculated birds reached the level of bacterial diversity seen in birds
raised under normal conditions. Neither PBS nor Lactobacillus inoculated birds
were able to adopt normal quail microbiota after one week of restricted exposure 
to bacteria, indicating that contact with diverse microbiota during the early
days of gut development in birds is critical for the establishment of healthy
intestinal community. Very early intervention in the form of a suitable bacterial
probiotic inoculant immediately post-hatch protected birds grown in extreme
hygiene conditions from developing anomalous gut microbiota and intestinal
damage. Our data shows that it is possible to induce dominance of desired strain 
using simple timed manipulation.
