This study investigated physiological alterations involved in the inactivation of
Levilactobacillus (L.) brevis and Leuconostoc (Lc.) mesenteroides in orange juice
caused by Citrus lemon essential oil (CLEO) and C. reticulata essential oil
(CREO) alone and combined with mild heat treatment (MHT). Damage in DNA, membrane
integrity, membrane potential, metabolic and efflux activity of bacterial cells
were measured after exposure (6 and 12 min) to CLEO or CREO (0.5 μL/mL) and/or
MHT (54 °C) using flow cytometry. Limonene was the major constituent in CLEO
(66.4%) and CREO (89.4%). The size of the damaged cell subpopulations increased
(p < 0.05) after longer exposure time and varied with the tested essential oil
and/or bacterial isolate. After exposure to CLEO and CREO alone, the cell
subpopulations with damage in measured physiological functions were in a range of
19.6-66.8% and 23.8-75.9%, respectively. Exposure to CREO resulted in larger Lc. 
mesenteroides cell subpopulations (35.4-68.7%) with damaged DNA, permeabilized
and depolarized membrane and compromised metabolic or efflux activity compared to
L. brevis (23.8-58.0%). In contrast, exposure to CLEO led to higher damaged L.
brevis cell subpopulations (35.1-77%) compared to Lc. mesenteroides (25.3-36.6%).
Exposure to combined treatments (CLEO or CREO and MHT) affected the measured
physiological functions in almost the entire L. brevis and Lc. mesenteroides cell
population (up to 99%), although the damage extension on each isolate varied with
tested essential oil. Results show that inactivation of L. brevis and Lc.
mesenteroides cells caused by CLEO and CREO alone and combined with MHT in orange
juice involves a multi-target action, which causes DNA damage, altered
permeability and depolarization of membrane and compromised metabolic and efflux 
activities.
