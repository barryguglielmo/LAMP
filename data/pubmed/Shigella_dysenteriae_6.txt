Shigella species are specialised lineages of Escherichia coli that have converged
to become human-adapted and cause dysentery by invading human gut epithelial
cells. Most studies of Shigella evolution have been restricted to comparisons of 
single representatives of each species; and population genomic studies of
individual Shigella species have focused on genomic variation caused by single
nucleotide variants and ignored the contribution of insertion sequences (IS)
which are highly prevalent in Shigella genomes. Here, we investigate the
distribution and evolutionary dynamics of IS within populations of Shigella
dysenteriae Sd1, Shigella sonnei and Shigella flexneri. We find that five IS
(IS1, IS2, IS4, IS600 and IS911) have undergone expansion in all Shigella
species, creating substantial strain-to-strain variation within each population
and contributing to convergent patterns of functional gene loss within and
between species. We find that IS expansion and genome degradation are most
advanced in S. dysenteriae and least advanced in S. sonnei; and using
genome-scale models of metabolism we show that Shigella species display
convergent loss of core E. coli metabolic capabilities, with S. sonnei and S.
flexneri following a similar trajectory of metabolic streamlining to that of S.
dysenteriae. This study highlights the importance of IS to the evolution of
Shigella and provides a framework for the investigation of IS dynamics and
metabolic reduction in other bacterial species.
