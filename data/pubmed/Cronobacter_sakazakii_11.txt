Cronobacter sakazakii is an opportunistic Gram-negative pathogen that could cause
meningitis and necrotizing enterocolitis. Several Gram-negative bacteria use the 
PmrA/PmrB system to sense and adapt to environmental change by resistance to
cationic antimicrobial peptides of host immune systems. The PmrA/PmrB
two-component system regulates several genes to modify LPS structure in the
bacterial outer membrane. The role of PmrA/PmrB of C. sakazakii has been studied 
within the current study. The results suggest that PmrA/PmrB plays a crucial role
in modifying LPS structure, cationic antimicrobial peptide susceptibility, cell
membrane permeability and hydrophobicity, and invading macrophage.
