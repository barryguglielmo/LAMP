The bacterial enhancer binding protein (bEBP) FlrC, controls motility and
colonization of Vibrio cholerae by regulating the transcription of class-III
flagellar genes in Ïƒ54-dependent manner. However, the mechanism by which FlrC
regulates transcription is not fully elucidated. While, most bEBPs require
nucleotides to stimulate the oligomerization necessary for function, our previous
study showed that the central domain of FlrC (FlrCC) forms heptamer in a
nucleotide-independent manner. Furthermore, heptameric FlrCC binds ATP in
'cis-mediated' style without any contribution from sensor I motif 285REDXXYR291
of the trans protomer. This atypical ATP binding raises the question of whether
heptamerization of FlrC is solely required for transcription regulation, or if it
is also critical for ATPase activity. ATPase assays and size exclusion
chromatography of the trans-variants FlrCC-Y290A and FlrCC-R291A showed
destabilization of heptameric assembly with concomitant abrogation of ATPase
activity. Crystal structures showed that in the cis-variant FlrCC-R349A drastic
shift of Walker A encroached ATP binding site whereas the site remained occupied 
by ADP in FlrCC-Y290A. We postulated that FlrCC heptamerizes through
concentration dependent cooperativity for maximal ATPase activity and upon
heptamerization, packing of trans-acting Tyr290 against cis-acting Arg349 compels
Arg349 to maintain proper conformation of Walker A. Finally, a Trp quenching
study revealed binding of cyclic-di-GMP with FlrCC Excess cyclic-di-GMP repressed
ATPase activity of FlrCC through destabilization of heptameric assembly,
especially at low concentration of protein. Systematic phylogenetic analysis
allowed us to propose similar regulatory mechanisms for FlrCs of several Vibrio
species and a set of monotrichous Gram negative bacteria.
