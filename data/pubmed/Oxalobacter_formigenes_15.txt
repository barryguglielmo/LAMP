OBJECTIVES: To investigate potential oxalate-degrading bacteria, including
Oxalobacter formigenes, Lactobacillus (Lac) and Bifidobacterium (Bif) genera, and
Oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase (oxc) encoding Lac (LX) and Bif (BX) species in
participants with recurrent calcium kidney stones, and their correlation with
24-h urine oxalate.
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Stool and 24-h urine samples were collected from 58
patients with urolithiasis (29 cases with and 29 without hyperoxaluria) and 29
healthy controls. Absolute quantitation and relative abundance of the bacteria
were measured by real-time PCR. The relationship between the investigated
bacteria and 24-h urine oxalate were assessed statistically.
RESULTS: The count per gram of stool and relative abundance of O. formigenes,
Lac, Bif, LX and BX and the number of participants carrying O. formigenes, LX and
BX bacteria were not significantly different between the groups; however, the
relative abundance of O. formigenes in the kidney stone group was lower than in
healthy controls (P = 0.035). More healthy controls were O. formigenes-positive
compared with participants in the kidney stone group (P = 0.052). The results of 
the linear regression model, including all study participants, showed that the
presence of O. formigenes could decrease 24-h urine oxalate (β = -8.4, P =
0.047). Neither Lac and Bif genera nor LX and BX species were correlated with
calcium stones or urine oxalate.
CONCLUSION: These results emphasize the role of O. formigenes in kidney stone
formation and its role in hyperoxaluria, which may be independent of kidney stone
disease. Moreover, our results suggest that, although some Lac and Bif strains
have oxalate-degrading potential, they may not be among the major
oxalate-degrading bacteria of the gut microbiome.
