Intraorbital infection shows a low incidence, but it might cause blindness or
even death. This case is unusual in that its origin from a craniofacial bone
fracture prior to infection of the maxillary sinus. A 33-year-old female patient 
was referred for right cheek swelling. When she visited the emergency room, we
removed right cheek hematoma and bacterial examination was done. In the past, she
had craniofacial bone surgical history due to a traffic accident 6 years ago.
Next day, the swelling had remained with proptosis and pus was recognized in the 
conjunctiva. We planned an emergency operation and removed the pus which was
already spread inside the orbit. And the evaluation for sinusitis was consulted
to the otorhinolaryngology department simultaneously. There were Prevotella
oralis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis bacterial infection
in the intraorbital and sinus respectively. Afterwards, the vigorous dressing was
done for over a month with intravenous antibiotics. Though the intraorbital
infection was resolved, blindness and extraocular movement limitation were
inevitable. In conclusion, close follow up of the maxillary sinus in facial bone 
fracture patients is important and aggressive treatment is needed when an
infection is diagnosed.
