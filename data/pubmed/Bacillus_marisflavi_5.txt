BACKGROUND: The present study was carried out to investigate the tap water
quality of public toilets in Amritsar, Punjab, India.
METHODS: Water samples from the taps of the public toilets were collected in
sterile containers and physicochemical and bacteriological analysis was performed
using standard methods. Also, genotypic and phenotypic characterization of the
bacterial isolates was performed using different biochemical tests and 16S
ribosomal RNA analysis. An antibiotic susceptibility test was performed using
antibiotics based on their mode of action. A biofilm assay was performed to
assess the adhesion potential of the isolates.
RESULTS: A total of 25 bacterial isolates were identified from the water samples,
including Acinetobacter junii, Acinetobacter pittii, Acinetobacter haemolyticus, 
Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus marisflavi, Bacillus flexus,
Bacillus oceanisediminis, Pseudomonas otitidis, Pseudomonas sp. RR013,
Pseudomonas sp. RR021, Pseudomonas sp. RR022, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter
cloacae. The results of the antimicrobial susceptibility test revealed that the
antibiotics cefodroxil, aztreonam, nitrofurantoin, cefepime, ceftazidime and
amoxyclav were found to be mostly ineffective against various isolates. The
biofilm assay revealed the weak, moderate and strong biofilm producers among
them.
CONCLUSIONS: The tap water in the public toilets was microbially contaminated and
needs to be monitored carefully. The antibiotic susceptibility profile showed
that of 25 bacterial isolates, 5 were multidrug resistant. Bacterial isolates
exhibited strong to weak adhesion potential in the biofilm assay.
