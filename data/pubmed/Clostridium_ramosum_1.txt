OBJECTIVES: The increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant microorganisms
(MDRO) is increasing the frequency of poor clinical outcomes, prolonging
hospitalizations, and raising healthcare costs. This study evaluated the
eradication efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and identified
microbial and functional biomarkers of MDRO decolonization.
METHODS: Fecal solution obtained from healthy unrelated donors was infused in the
participants' guts which had been colonized with carbapenemase-producing
enterobacteriacea (CPE), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), or both CPE and 
VRE. Fecal samples from recipients were collected and microbiome changes before
and after FMT were assessed.
RESULTS: Twenty-four (68.6%) out of 35 patients were decolonized within one year 
of receiving FMT. Multivariate analysis showed that FMT (FMT: hazard ratio
(HR) = 5.343, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.877-15.212, p = 0.002) and MDRO
types (CPE: HR = 11.146, 95% CI = 2.420-51.340, p = 0.002; CPE/VRE: HR = 2.948,
95% CI = 1.200-7.246, p = 0.018; VRE served as the reference) were significant
independent factors associated with time to decolonization. Microbiota analysis
showed higher richness and biodiversity before FMT resulted in VRE
decolonization. The species Clostridium ramosum and the genuses Anaerostipes and 
Eisenbergiella could serve as taxonomic biomarkers and K02017 could serve as a
functional biomarker for VRE clearance.
CONCLUSION: FMT is an effective way to decolonize MDRO and its effectiveness may 
be predicted by microbiome analysis.
