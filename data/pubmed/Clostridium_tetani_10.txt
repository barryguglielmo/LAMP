BACKGROUND: Tetanus is an infectious disease that can be seen in all age groups
in underdeveloped and developing countries, where vaccination programs are
inadequate. In developed countries, it is reported more frequently in the adult
age group, where the protection of vaccination is diminished and the doses are
delayed.
CASE: In this report, we present generalized tetanus, which was observed in two
male patients aged 12 and 6 years, admitted at different times, together with
clinical course and treatment approaches. Both patients belong to different
nationalities, who immigrated a couple of months before their application to our 
hospital. They applied with similar histories and complaints and were not
vaccinated during infancy.
CONCLUSION: With the development of vaccination programs, this disease with high 
morbidity and mortality can be prevented.
