Staphylococcus pasteuri is a coagulase negative bacterium which although formally
described in 1993, has only recently become possible to reliably speciate in
diagnostic microbiology laboratories. S. pasteuri remains an extremely infrequent
cause of human infection to date, namely bacteremia in an individual suffering
acute myeloid leukemia, catheter-associated urinary tract infection in a patient 
receiving chemotherapy and endocarditis within a case series without specific
clinical information. As such, our report provides the first detailed account of 
Staphylococcus pasteuri infective endocarditis entailing a subacute
community-onset infection involving native aortic and mitral valves, multiple
systemic emboli, and ultimately cardiothoracic surgery.
