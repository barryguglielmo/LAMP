Lactobionic acid (LBA) was produced by fermentation of Pseudomonas taetrolens.
First, to increase the production of LBA by P. taetrolens, we controlled the pH
of culture medium by CaCO3 addition (30 g/L) and then examined the initial
lactose concentration ranging from 50 to 200 g/L and the growth temperature
ranging from 20 to 37 °C. Both the LBA production titer (180 g/L) and the
productivity (2.5 g/L h) were highest at 200 g/L lactose concentration and 25 °C 
of cell growth temperature in shake-flask culture. Although the production of LBA
(178 g/L) was almost similar during the batch fermentation of P. taetrolens using
5 L bioreactor, the LBA productivity highly increased to 4.9 g/L h. The method
using ethanol precipitation and ion-exchange chromatography was developed to
recover the pure LBA from the fermentation broth. The optimum volume of ethanol
and pH of culture medium for the precipitation of Ca2+ salt form of LBA were six 
volume of ethanol and pH 6.5, respectively. The cation-exchange resin T42 finally
showed the best recovery yield (97.6%) of LBA from the culture supernatant. The
production titer (178 g/L) and the productivity (4.9 g/L h) of lactobionic acid
in this study were highest among the previous studies ever reported using P.
taetrolens as a production strain of LBA.
