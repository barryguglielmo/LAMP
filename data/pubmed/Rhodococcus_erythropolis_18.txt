Two genes, aldA, and mnoA, encoding an NAD-dependent aliphatic dehydrogenase and 
N,N'-dimethyl-4-nitrosoaniline-dependent methanol dehydrogenase, respectively,
are strongly expressed when Rhodococcus erythropolis N9T-4 is grown under
oligotrophic conditions. In this study, we found a transcriptional regulator
required for the transcription of both aldA and mnoA. The transcriptional
regulator was also found to be essential for the oligotrophic growth of N9T-4.
