To understand the role of intestinal mucosal microbiota on mental stress-related 
diarrhoea, we collected the intestinal mucosa of mice treated with Folium senna
extract gavage combined with restraint and tail pinch stress for 7 days; and
intestinal mucosal microbiota characteristics were analyzed by 16S rRNA Pacbio
SMRT gene full-length sequencing. The results showed that the diversity (i.e.,
alpha diversity including the Chao1, Simpson, ACE, and Shannon indices and beta
diversity including the NMDS of weighted UniFrac distances) and composition of
the microbial community in the intestinal mucosa of mice with diarrhoea and
repeated stress changed significantly (P < 0.05). In the co-occurrence network,
Staphylococcus sciuri and Escherichia fergusonii was identified as putative
keystone species. Moreover, the characteristics of the intestinal microbial
species was analyzed by LEfSe, Metastats, and group difference, and ten altered
gut microbiota species can be used as characteristic microbes in the mice with
diarrhoea and repeated stress: the abundances of Stigmatella aurantiaca,
Candidatus arthromitus sp. SFB-mouse, Erythrobacter gaetbuli, Desulfitobacterium 
hafniense, Ochrobactrum pituitosum, and Candidatus arthromitus sp. SFB-mouse-NL
in the model group were significantly lower than those in the control group
(P < 0.05); whereas Microbacterium dextranolyticum, Klebsiella pneumoniae,
Escherichia sp. BBDP27, and Streptococcus danieliae were enriched in the control 
group (P < 0.05). Collectively, mental stress-related diarrhoea increased the
intestinal microbiota diversity. The species associated with mental
stress-related diarrhoea including Microbacterium dextranolyticum, Klebsiella
pneumoniae, Escherichia sp. BBDP27, and Streptococcus danieliae were
significantly enriched; while the species which are beneficial to mental
stress-related diarrhoea are Stigmatella aurantiaca, Candidatus arthromitus sp.
SFB-mouse, Erythrobacter gaetbuli, Desulfitobacterium hafniense, Ochrobactrum
pituitosum, and Candidatus arthromitus sp. SFB-mouse-NL for its significantly
depleted.
