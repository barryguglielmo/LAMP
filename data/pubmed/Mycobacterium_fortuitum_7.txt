PURPOSE: To report clinical features and outcomes of nontuberculous mycobacteria 
(NTM) presenting as uveitis in HIV positive patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective study of HIV positive patients who were
diagnosed as uveitis due to NTM.
RESULTS: Six eyes of four HIV positive patients with NTM were studied. Average
age at presentation was 35.5Â years (range 30-38). With specific PCR primers,
Mycobacterium avium was detected in three patients (75%) and Mycobacterium
fortuitum in one patient (25%). Culture was positive in two cases. Two eyes
(33.33%) each had endophthalmitis and necrotizing retinitis like picture, one eye
(16.66%) each had chorioretinitis and frosted branch angitis like. Visual acuity 
improved in two eyes (33.33%), worsened in three eyes (50%), and remained
unchanged in one eye (16.6%).
CONCLUSIONS: NTM infection is a unique entity in immunosuppressed with poor
visual outcome. PCR forms a useful tool for rapid diagnosis and timely initiation
of specific anti-tuberculosis therapy.
