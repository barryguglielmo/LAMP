BACKGROUND: This report highlights the first published case of fatal septic shock
associated with Clostridium perfringens and Enterococcus avium bacteremia due to 
infective gastroenteritis.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of hepatic infarction, abscess, and death
following gastroenteritis in a 63-year-old Aboriginal man who initially presented
to a rural hospital with suspected food poisoning. The patient had persistent
fever and was commenced on empirical antibiotics. His blood culture results were 
positive for Clostridium perfringens and Enterococcus avium. He was transferred
to a tertiary center but developed organ failure and refractory shock. Initial
computed tomography of the abdomen was unremarkable, but repeat imaging showed
small bowel enteritis, hepatic abscess, and infarction as a result of portal vein
septic thromboembolism. Despite maximal intensive care treatment, including
percutaneous drainage of hepatic abscess and broad antibiotic cover, the patient 
died 6 days after initial presentation.
CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the rare but commonly fatal course of sepsis
associated with Clostridium perfringens bacteremia and demonstrates detrimental
effects of coinfection with Enterococcus avium, including potential for rapidly
seeding abscess formation. Lessons for rural practice are highlighted, including 
the need for urgent and early referral for intensive care support, particularly
for patients with complex comorbidities.
