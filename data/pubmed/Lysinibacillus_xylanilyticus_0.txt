Bioconversion of C1 chemicals such as methane and methanol into higher
carbon-chain chemicals has been widely studied. Methanol oxidation catalyzed by
methanol dehydrogenase (Mdh) is one of the key steps in methanol utilization in
bacterial methylotrophy. In bacteria, few NAD+-dependent Mdhs have been reported 
that convert methanol to formaldehyde. In this study, an uncharacterized Mdh gene
from Lysinibacillus xylanilyticus (Lxmdh) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia
coli. The maximum alcohol oxidation activity of the recombinant enzyme was
observed at pH 9.5 and 55°C in the presence of 10 mM Mg2+. To improve oxidation
activity, rational approach-based, site-directed mutagenesis of 16 residues in
the putative active site and NAD+-binding region was performed. The mutations
S101V, T141S, and A164F improved the enzyme's specific activity toward methanol
compared to that of the wild-type enzyme. These mutants show a slightly higher
turnover rate than that of wild-type, although their K M values were increased
compared to that of wild-type. Consequently, according the kinetic results, S101,
T141, and A164 positions may related to the catalytic activity in the active site
for methanol dehydrogenation. It should be further studied other mutant variants 
with high activity for methanol. In conclusion, we characterized a new Lxmdh and 
its variants that may be potentially useful for the development of synthetic
methylotrophy in the future.
