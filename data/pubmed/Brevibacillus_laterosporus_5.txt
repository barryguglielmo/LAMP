One of the main obstacles to studying the surface ultrastructure of microbial
cells by atomic force microscopy (AFM) is determining how to immobilize live
cells on the AFM substrates. Each method has its own advantages and
disadvantages. The aim of this study was to characterize a new simple and
inexpensive method using two types of polyethersulfone (PES) membrane filters
that differ in pore size (micropore and nanopore) to immobilize live and dead
Brevibacillus laterosporus for AFM imaging. B. laterosporus was easily trapped by
the microporous PES membrane, facilitating the successful AFM scanning of the
bacterial surface ultrastructure. In addition, B. laterosporus strongly attached 
to the nanoporous membranes and withstood the pulling forces exerted by the AFM
tip during scanning. These methods of immobilization did not affect the cell
viability. The nanostructure and roughness of the bacterial surface were also
observed for live, fixed, and air-dried cells. Live and dead bacteria displayed
similar morphologies at low resolution, while at high resolution, live bacteria
displayed a more convoluted surface ("brain-like structure").
