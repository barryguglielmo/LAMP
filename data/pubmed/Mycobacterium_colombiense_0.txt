Mycobacterium colombiense, which belongs to the M. avium complex, is reported to 
have been isolated from cases of disseminated infection in both immunocompromised
and immunocompetent patients. During the isolation of protists from water samples
in French Guyana, we co-isolated a flagellated green alga (Polytoma sp.) and a
mycobacterium identified as M. colombiense.
