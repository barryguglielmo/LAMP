Emerging studies have addressed the role of probiotics in inflammation modulation
via modifying gut microbiota. Perturbed gut microbiota is recognized as a pivotal
trigger in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and manipulating gut
microbiota at the early phase may be helpful to alleviate the disease based on
the fact that dysbiosis occurred prior to clinical arthritis. The current study
compared the effects of preventive and therapeutic treatment with Bifidobacterium
adolescentis on collagen induced arthritis (CIA) in rats. Early B. adolescentis
administration before CIA modelling performed better than late B. adolescentis
treatment in reducing the clinical symptoms, rebalancing the pro- and
anti-inflammatory responses and maintaining the fecal concentration of short
chain fatty acids (SCFAs), as well as restoring the intestinal dysbiosis.
Preventive B. adolescentis treatment restored the gut microbiota to a normal
level while late B. adolescentis fed rats showed clearly different gut microbial 
profiles. In addition, there were slight discrepancies between early- and late-
treatment of B. adolescentis in the production of specific auto-antibodies and
tight junction proteins. All those results highlighted that early treatment of
probiotics in arthritis might be a better timing for alleviating arthritis.
