OBJECTIVE: To identify the microbiome in sockets with alveolar osteitis and
compare it with a control group using metagenomic techniques.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in subjects that had
undergone a tooth extraction. Microbiological samples were taken from the sockets
of 10 patients with dry socket after tooth extraction (AO group) and 10 patients 
in whom exodontia resulted in no postoperative complications (control group).
Bacterial DNA was isolated, and the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced.
Multiplexed tag-encoded sequencing of DNA from the samples was performed, and the
reads were processed by Metagenomic Rapid Annotation.
RESULTS: A total of 151 different species were found: 55 bacteria were only found
in the AO group, 51 were specific to the control group, and 45 were common to
both groups. The most frequently found genera in both groups were Prevotella.
Prevotella nanceiensis, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Treponema maltophilum,
Veillonella dispar, Tannerella forsythia, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides were
found in several patients with alveolar osteitis, with an abundance greater than 
0.5%, and were absent in all the control group samples.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients who develop alveolar osteitis after dental extractions
might have a different microbiota from that of patients without postoperative
complications. Since this is a preliminary report, further research is needed to 
assess whether bacteria play an important role in the etiology of dry socket.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study seems to indicate that bacteria may play an
important role in the alveolar osteitis etiology. Thus, new prevention and
treatment strategies should be considered.
