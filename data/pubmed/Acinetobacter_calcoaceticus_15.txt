The increasing emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria has been
recognized as a public health threat worldwide. Hospitalized patients and
outpatients are commonly infected by non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli
(NFGNB), particularly the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii
complex (ACB) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Antimicrobial agents are critical for
treating the nosocomial infections caused by NFGNB. The aim of this study was to 
assess antimicrobial resistance and the use of antimicrobial agents. The
bacterial isolates of 638,152 specimens from both inpatients and outpatients,
retrieved from 2001 to 2008 at a medical center in central Taiwan, were examined 
for their susceptibility to various antimicrobial agents, including cefepime,
imipenem, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, amikacin, meropenem, and levofloxacin.
Administrated prescriptions of the monitored antibiotics were analyzed using the 
Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). Our results show that
the defined daily doses (DDDs) for cefepime, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin
increased with time, and a trend toward reduced antimicrobial sensitivities of
both ACB and P. aeruginosa was noticeable. In conclusion, the antimicrobial
sensitivities of ACB and P. aeruginosa were reduced with the increased use of
antibiotics. Continuous surveillance of antibiotic prescriptions and the
prevalence of emerging resistance in nosocomial infections is warranted.
