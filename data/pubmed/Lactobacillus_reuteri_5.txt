BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus reuteri I5007 possesses many excellent probiotic
characteristics in piglets. miRNA plays important role in host-microbiota
interactions, but the mechanism by which L. reuteri I5007 regulates intestinal
function through its influence on miRNA expression is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: This study analyzed the miRNA expression patterns in the ileum mucosa 
tissue of piglets by L. reuteri I5007 treatment, aim to clarify its molecular
mechanism for regulating intestinal function through miRNA.
METHODS: Neonatal piglets were orally administered L. reuteri I5007 or a placebo 
daily starting on day 1, and differential expression of ileal miRNAs was analyzed
at 10 and 20 days of age by small RNA sequencing.
RESULTS: 361 known porcine miRNAs were identified, and ten miRNAs were highly
expressed in the ileum mucosa in both treatments. Nineteen differentially
expressed (DE) miRNAs were identified in response to L. reuteri treatment, and
four DE miRNAs (ssc-miR-196a, -196b-5p, -1285 and -10386) were differentially
expressed at both time points. The KEGG pathway analyses showed the targets of 19
DE miRNAs were involved in 63 significantly enriched pathways, including the
PI3K-Akt and MAPK pathways, which were confirmed to play important roles in
probiotic-host communication. L. reuteri I5007 exerted anti-inflammatory effects 
by influencing the levels of inflammatory cytokines. Suppressor of cytokine
signalling 4 gene was the target gene of ssc-miR-196a/-196b-5p, overexpression of
ssc-miR-196a/-196b-5p downregulated the mRNA expression of IL-1β and TNFα in
IPEC-J2 cells.
CONCLUSION: Our study provides new insight into the role of miRNAs in the
intestinal function of piglets after L. reuteri I5007 treatment.
