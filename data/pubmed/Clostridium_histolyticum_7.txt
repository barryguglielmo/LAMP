This study investigated influence of skin tears on patient-reported outcomes of
injection of collagenase clostridium histolyticum for Dupuytren's disease and
association between extension deficit of digits before injection and skin tear
after the injection. From 2016 to 2018, 391 Dupuytren's cords were treated in 184
patients in a prospective cohort study and the patients were evaluated before
injection and six months after injection. Skin tears occurred in 50% of these
patients. We found no significant differences in the patient-reported outcomes
between patients with or without skin tears. A higher extension deficit before
treatment was associated with significantly increased frequency of skin tears. We
conclude that the incidence of skin tears after injection does not affect patient
reported outcomes six months after collagenase injection, but the incidence of
skin tears is significantly associated with the severity of pre-treatment finger 
extension deficits.Level of evidence: II.
