To combat escalating levels of antibiotic resistance, novel strategies are
developed to address the everlasting demand for new antibiotics. This study aimed
at investigating amicoumacin antibiotics from the desert-derived Bacillus
subtilis PJS by using the modern MS/MS-based molecular networking approach. Two
new amicoumacins, namely hetiamacin E (1) and hetiamacin F (2), were finally
isolated. The planar structures were determined by analysis of extensive NMR
spectroscopic and HR-ESI-MS data, and the absolute configurations were concluded 
by analysis of the CD spectrum. Hetiamacin E (1) showed strong antibacterial
activities against methicillin-sensitive and resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis
at 2-4 µg/mL, and methicillin-sensitive and resistant Staphylococcus aureus at
8-16 µg/mL. Hetiamacin F (2) exhibited moderate antibacterial activities against 
Staphylococcus sp. at 32 µg/mL. Both compounds were inhibitors of protein
biosynthesis demonstrated by a double fluorescent protein reporter system.
