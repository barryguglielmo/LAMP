Mud crab Scylla paramamosain (S. paramamosain) is an economically important
marine crab species around the world. White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) and
Aeromonas hydrophila (AH) are pathogens during mud crab mariculture. It has been 
reported that gut microbiota possessed a great impact on the host development,
nutrition, immunity, and disease resistance. However, little information was
known about the impacts of WSSV or AH infection on the structure, composition,
and function of the gut microbiotain of mud crabs. In this study, the gut
microbiota of mud crabs infected with A. hydrophila and WSSV were characterized. 
The results showed that the composition and bacteria correlation of the gut
microbiota were significantly decreased. During A. hydrophila infection, the
pathogens played a major regulatory role in host. While in the mud crabs infected
with WSSV, many beneficial strains had a great impact on the host expect for the 
pathogens. Therefore, our study revealed the effect of pathogens infection on gut
microbiota of mud crabs and clarified the difference between viral infection and 
bacterial infection.
