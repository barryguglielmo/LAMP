A phenotype of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, resistant to
piperacillin/tazobactam (TZP) but susceptible to carbapenems and 3rd generation
cephalosporins, has emerged. The resistance mechanism associated with this
phenotype has been identified as hyperproduction of the Î²-lactamase TEM. However,
the mechanism of hyperproduction due to gene amplification is not well
understood. Here, we report a mechanism of gene amplification due to a
translocatable unit (TU) excising from an IS26-flanked pseudo-compound
transposon, PTn6762, which harbours blaTEM-1B. The TU re-inserts into the
chromosome adjacent to IS26 and forms a tandem array of TUs, which increases the 
copy number of blaTEM-1B, leading to TEM-1B hyperproduction and TZP resistance.
Despite a significant increase in blaTEM-1B copy number, the TZP-resistant
isolate does not incur a fitness cost compared to the TZP-susceptible ancestor.
This mechanism of amplification of blaTEM-1B is an important consideration when
using genomic data to predict susceptibility to TZP.
