BACKGROUND: Botulism is a severe neuroparalytic disease caused by toxins produced
by several Clostridium species. This work presents the surveillance results of
botulism in Iran, with the distribution of the cases by regions and by vehicle of
transmission.
METHODS: We describe the findings of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) surveillance on 2037 suspected cases of food-borne botulism
during 2007-2017.
RESULTS: A total of 252 (12.3%) cases were confirmed to food-borne botulism. The 
mean annual incidence per 100,000 Iranian Natives was 7.1 cases for male
individuals and 3.3 cases for female individuals. All botulism events were
confirmed to be foodborne. The most commonly implicated food was home-prepared
traditional processed fish product, followed by the consumption of commercially
canned products and non-pasteurized dairy products. Forty-eight (19%) fatal
botulism were reported which, the case-fatality rate declined from 4.5% to 0.7%
during the study period.
CONCLUSION: Laboratory-based diagnosis of botulism is an imperative procedure to 
elucidate cases, particularly food-borne botulism, to identify toxins in food and
confirm clinical diagnosis, helping sanitary control measures. In addition,
educational materials related to botulism prevention should be disseminated to
different communities.
