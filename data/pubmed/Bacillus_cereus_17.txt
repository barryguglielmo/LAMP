You Can't B. cereus - A Review of Bacillus cereus Strains That Cause Anthrax-Like
Disease.

Emerging strains of Bacillus cereus, traditionally considered a self-limiting
foodborne pathogen, have been associated with anthrax-like disease in mammals,
including humans. The strains have emerged by divergent evolution and, as
exchange of genetic material in the Bacillus genus occurs naturally, it is
possible that further isolates will be identified in the future. The strains vary
in their genotypes and phenotypes, combining traits of both B. cereus and B.
anthracis species. Cases of anthrax-like disease associated with these strains
result in similar symptoms and mortality rates as those caused by B. anthracis.
The strains are susceptible to frontline antibiotics used in the treatment of
anthrax and existing vaccines provide protection in animal models. The emergence 
of these strains has reignited the debate surrounding classification of the B.
cereus sensu lato group and serves as a reminder that the field of medical
microbiology is constantly changing and remains an important and ongoing area of 
research.
