BACKGROUND: Intrauterine infection accounts for about one quarter of cases of
spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB); however, at present it is not possible to
efficiently identify pregnant women at risk in order to deliver preventative
treatments.
OBJECTIVE: To establish a vaginal microbial DNA test for Australian women in
mid-pregnancy that will identify those at increased risk of sPTB.
STUDY DESIGN: 1000 women with singleton pregnancies were recruited in Perth,
Australia. Mid-vaginal swabs were collected between 12- and 23-weeks' gestation. 
DNA was extracted for detection of 23 risk-related microbial DNA targets by qPCR.
Obstetric history, pregnancy outcome and demographics were recorded.
RESULTS: After excluding 64 women due to losses to follow-up and insufficient
sample for microbial analyses, the final cohort consisted of 936 women of
predominantly Caucasian ethnicity (74.3%). The overall PTB rate was 12.6% (118
births); the sPTB rate <37 weeks' was 6.2% (2.9% ≤34 weeks'), while the PPROM
rate was 4.2%. No single individual microbial target predicted increased sPTB
risk. Conversely, women who subsequently delivered at term had higher amounts of 
either Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus gasseri or Lactobacillus jensenii
DNA in their vaginal swabs (13.8% sPTB vs 31.2% term; P=0.005). In the remaining 
women, a specific microbial DNA signature was identified that was strongly
predictive of sPTB risk, consisting of DNA from G. vaginalis (clade 4), L. iners 
and U. parvum (serovars 3 and/or 6). Risk prediction was improved if F. nucleatum
detection was included in the test algorithm. The final algorithm, which we
called the 'GLU' test, was able to detect women at risk of sPTB <37 weeks' and
≤34 weeks', with sensitivities of 37.9% and 44.4%, respectively; likelihood
ratios (+/-) were 2.22/0.75 and 2.52/0.67, respectively. PPROM was more than
twice as common in GLU-positive women. Adjusting for maternal demographics,
ethnicity, and clinical history, did not improve prediction. Only a previous
history of sPTB was more effective at predicting sPTB than a GLU-positive result 
(OR 3.6).
CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a vaginal bacterial DNA signature that identifies
women with a singleton pregnancy who are at increased risk of sPTB and may
benefit from targeted antimicrobial therapy.
