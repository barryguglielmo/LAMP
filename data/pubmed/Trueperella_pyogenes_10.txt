A multiplex PCR method was developed to detect the main pathogens of Qinghai
Tibetan sheep endometritis. First, the genomes of five standard bacterial strains
were extracted and specific primers were selected; the multiplex PCR method was
established by using the genome of the standard strain as a template. The samples
were collected by sterile cotton swab from Tibetan sheep uterus, and then placed 
in LB medium and numbered. After 48 h, the genomes of cultured bacteria were
extracted and detected by single PCR method, then the positive samples were
recorded. The positive samples detected by single PCR were selected for multiplex
PCR detection and recorded again. The coincidence rate between these two methods 
was calculated to measure the accuracy of multiplex PCR. In order to identify the
species of the pathogen, 30 positive samples verified by single and multiplex PCR
were randomly selected for bacterial isolation and identification. In the 600
samples, the infected ratio of Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS) was 47.33%,
Escherichia coli 34.83%, Staphylococcus aureus 6.5%, Salmonella and Trueperella
pyogenes were negatively detected. Among the positive samples detected by
multiplex PCR, the positive ratio of GBS was 45.50%, E. coli 33.50%, S. aureus
6.5%. Comparison of two detection results, Multiplex PCR detection coincidence
rate is more than 95%. The isolated pathogens were identified as E. coli, GBS and
S. aureus, which was consistent with the results of two methods. The multiplex
PCR method was successfully established and the main pathogens of endometritis in
Qinghai Tibetan sheep were GBS, E. coli and S. aureus.

Publisher: 本研究旨在建立一种多重PCR 方法检测青海藏绵羊子宫内膜炎主要的病原菌。首先，提取5
种标准菌株基因组，筛选出特异性引物；然后以标准菌株的基因组为模板，建立多重PCR 方法。用无菌棉拭子涂抹藏绵羊子宫，置于LB 培养液中培养并编号，48 h
后提取样品基因组。运用单一PCR 法对600 份样品基因组进行检测，记录阳性样品；再挑取单一PCR 法检测的阳性样品进行多重PCR
检测，再次记录阳性样品，通过计算两种检测方法的符合率验证多重PCR 方法；随机挑出30 份阳性样品，进行病原菌分离鉴定菌种种类。单一PCR
检测的样品中，无乳链球菌感染比例占47.33%，大肠杆菌占34.83%，金黄色葡萄球菌占6.5%，未检出沙门氏菌和化脓隐秘杆菌；多重PCR
检测的阳性样品中，无乳链球菌感染比例占45.50%，大肠杆菌占33.50%，金黄色葡萄球菌占6.5%；两种检测结果相比较，多重PCR
检测出的符合率均高于95%；分离鉴定的病原菌与两种PCR 方法检测出的菌种结果基本一致。成功建立了多重PCR
方法并检测出引起青海藏绵羊子宫内膜炎的主要病原菌为无乳链球菌、大肠杆菌和金黄色葡萄球菌。.
