Pathogenic microorganisms use various mechanisms to conserve energy in host
tissues and environmental reservoirs. One widespread but often overlooked means
of energy conservation is through the consumption or production of molecular
hydrogen (H2). Here, we comprehensively review the distribution, biochemistry,
and physiology of H2 metabolism in pathogens. Over 200 pathogens and pathobionts 
carry genes for hydrogenases, the enzymes responsible for H2 oxidation and/or
production. Furthermore, at least 46 of these species have been experimentally
shown to consume or produce H2 Several major human pathogens use the large
amounts of H2 produced by colonic microbiota as an energy source for aerobic or
anaerobic respiration. This process has been shown to be critical for growth and 
virulence of the gastrointestinal bacteria Salmonella enterica serovar
Typhimurium, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter concisus, and Helicobacter
pylori (including carcinogenic strains). H2 oxidation is generally a facultative 
trait controlled by central regulators in response to energy and oxidant
availability. Other bacterial and protist pathogens produce H2 as a diffusible
end product of fermentation processes. These include facultative anaerobes such
as Escherichia coli, S Typhimurium, and Giardia intestinalis, which persist by
fermentation when limited for respiratory electron acceptors, as well as obligate
anaerobes, such as Clostridium perfringens, Clostridioides difficile, and
Trichomonas vaginalis, that produce large amounts of H2 during growth. Overall,
there is a rich literature on hydrogenases in growth, survival, and virulence in 
some pathogens. However, we lack a detailed understanding of H2 metabolism in
most pathogens, especially obligately anaerobic bacteria, as well as a holistic
understanding of gastrointestinal H2 transactions overall. Based on these
findings, we also evaluate H2 metabolism as a possible target for drug
development or other therapies.
