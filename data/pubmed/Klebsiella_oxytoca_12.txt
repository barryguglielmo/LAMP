OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the cumulative fraction
of response (CFR) of various tigecycline dosing regimens in patients with hepatic
or renal impairment.
METHODS: Monte Carlo simulations were performed using pharmacokinetic parameters 
and microbiological data to evaluate various tigecycline regimens in patients
with hepatic or renal impairment.
RESULTS: For HAP and cIAI, the regimen of 25 mg q12h achieved CFR values of >90% 
in Child-Pugh C patients against Gram-positive bacteria and partial Gram-negative
bacteria (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella oxytoca). However, dose increases of
tigecycline was mostly required for Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae
and Acinetobacter baumanni. The conventional tigecycline regimen (50 mg q12h) was
effective for HAP and cIAI caused by Gram-positive bacteria and Escherichia coli 
in patients with renal impairment. For HAP caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae and
Enterobacter cloacae, patients with severe renal failure can use the standard
dose regimen 50 mg q12h, and other patients need to increase the dose of
tigecycline. However, when treating cSSSI caused by Acinetobacter baumannii,
Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae, all tigecycline maintenance doses
have a CFR <90%.
CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to optimize tigecycline dosage regimens in patients 
with hepatic or renal impairment in order to maximise clinical response and
minimise the probability of exposure-related toxicity.
