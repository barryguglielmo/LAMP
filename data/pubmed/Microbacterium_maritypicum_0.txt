Microbacterium species are gram positive coryneforms generally considered as a
contaminant when identified in gram stain of blood culture, especially when
time-to-positivity is longer than 48 h. We encountered a case of infective
endocarditis associated with Microbacterium maritypicum bacteremia, which became 
positive after 48 h of incubation in three out of four bottles. The antimicrobial
management is controversial as vancomycin is generally assumed to cover most gram
positive bacilli, but our susceptibility result demonstrated minimum inhibitory
concentration of 4 μg/mL of vancomycin, indicating non-susceptibility. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of infective endocarditis
associated with Microbacterium maritypicum.
