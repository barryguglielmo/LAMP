The honey bee, which lives in the crowded environment of a social hive, is
vulnerable to disease infection and spread. Despite efforts to develop various
diagnostic methods, American foulbrood (AFB) caused by Paenibacillus larvae
infection has caused enormous damage to the apicultural industry. Here, we
investigated the volatile organic compounds derived from AFB. After inoculation
of the AFB pathogen in honey bee larvae under lab conditions, we identified
propionic acid, valeric acid, and 2-nonanone as volatile disease markers (VDMs)
of AFB infection using GC/MS. Electrophysiological recordings demonstrated that
middle-aged bees, the hygienic-aged bees, are more sensitive to these VDMs than
the foragers. Thus, these VDMs have the potential to be efficient and significant
cues for worker detection of AFB infected larvae in bee hives. This study
supports the idea that the specific olfactory sensitivity of different worker
bees depends on their tasks. Taken together, our finding is crucial and
sufficient to develop novel disease volatile markers associated with honey bee
diseases to diagnose and study the molecular and neural correlates of given
hygienic behavior detecting these volatile chemicals by honey bees.
