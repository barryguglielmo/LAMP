The aim of this study was to compare the physicochemical properties, filling
ability, and antibacterial activity of a premixed calcium silicate-based sealer
to those of a powder-liquid bioceramic sealer. Ceraseal (CS) and BioRoot (BR)
materials were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive 
X-ray spectroscopy at 7 and 14 d of immersion in distilled water. The filling
ability of the two sealers as well as the water contact angle, solubility, flow, 
roughness, crystalline microstructure, pH, and compressive strength were also
evaluated. The antibacterial activity was assessed through an agar diffusion as
well as through direct tests. All the results were statistically analyzed using
one-way or two-way analysis of variance tests. Statistically significant lower
void percentages were observed for CS at 2 and 8 mm from the working length (WL) 
compared to those for the BR group, whilst no significant difference was observed
at 5 mm from the WL. BR sealer showed higher alkaline pH, rougher surface, lower 
water contact angle values, lower flowability, and higher solubility compared to 
CS. BR showed globular and needle-like crystalline microstructure, whilst CS had 
globular and flower-like crystalline microstructure up to 72 h. No statistical
difference was found for the compressive strength between the two sealers. BR and
CS showed no antibacterial effect against Enterococcus faecalis after 3 h, whilst
both sealers showed antibacterial capacity after 24 and 72 h. BR demonstrated
higher antibacterial activity after 24 h. In conclusion, the use of bioceramic
sealers may play an important role in controlling bacterial growth. Moreover, CS 
may have superior filling ability and lower solubility than the BioRoot sealer
due to its specific chemical composition and mixing method.
