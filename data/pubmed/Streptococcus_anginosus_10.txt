Streptococcus anginosus (S. anginosus) is a subgroup of viridans streptococci
that tend to form a deep-seated abscess. These bacteria can be part of healthy
human flora and commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract and oral cavity.
Infective endocarditis is most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus and
Streptococcus. Among the Streptococcus group, anginosus is extremely rare to
cause endocarditis, and there are only a few case reports available. We present a
patient with S. anginosus bacteremia who subsequently got diagnosed with
metastatic colon cancer along with aortic and mitral valve endocarditis.
