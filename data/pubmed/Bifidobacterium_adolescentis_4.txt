The infection of fruits by Penicillium expansum (P. expansum) do not only cause
economic loss but also potentially endanger human health, especially because few 
biocontrol agents against this fungus have been well studied yet. In this work,
to verity the antifungal activity against P. expansum of 22 Bifidobacterium and
44 Lactobacillus, dual-culture overlay assay, microtiter plate well assay and
agar spot assay were successively performed. One of the strain, Bifidobacterium
adolescentis (B. adolescentis) CCFM1108 exhibited the most potent inhibition
ability among all tested strains. Additionally, we showed that multiple
antifungal compounds produced by tested strain synergistically inhibit the growth
of P. expansum, including lactic acid, acetic acid, 3-phenyllactic acid and
p-hydroxyphenyllactic acid. Those active compounds mentioned were detected in the
cell-free supernatant and characterized by metabolomics analysis using GC-MS.
Correspondingly, B. adolescentis CCFM1108 supernatant disrupted plasma membrane
integrity of the P. expansum mycelial and drastically reduced patulin production 
in P. expansum. The inhibitive effects of B. adolescentis CCFM1108 were also
confirmed with three other P. expansum strains. The active inhibitory properties 
of Bifidobacterium strains, especially B. adolescentis CCFM1108, indicate that B.
adolescentis can be potentially used as a novel bioagent to prevent or delay
fungal spoilage on fruit.
