Bacterial pigments are the unique and sustainable source of bioactive colour
compounds used in cosmetics, food, textiles, printing and pharmaceutical
products. Here, we report the pigment-producing isolates and their biological
activities that could be benefited for different industries including
cosmeceuticals. In this study, a total of 19 pigment-producing bacteria were
isolated and purified from collected soil and water samples. The colour
production ability of purified bacteria was observed up to 5 transfers. Of the 19
isolates, two isolates lost colour production ability in subsequent transfers.
Crude pigments extracted from the remaining 17 isolates showed sunscreen activity
in the range of 0.4-8.34. However, only 6 of them showed significant
antibacterial and antioxidant activities. In the media optimization experiment,
these 6 bacteria showed optimum growth in neutral to alkaline pH, while optimum
temperatures for growth were different for different bacteria. One isolate
produces the promising pigment, out of all six potential pigments. It is stable
up to 5 transfers, having antioxidant and antibacterial activity with Sun
protective activity; the strain was identified using 16srRNA gene sequencing and 
obtained accession number as MK770403 (probable strain is Staphylococcus xylosus)
from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. The results
of this study suggested that these bioactive pigments can further be developed
and used as antibacterial, antioxidant and sun-protective ingredients in
cosmeceuticals.
