Native collagen-based membranes are used to guide bone regeneration; but due to
their rapid biodegradation, this treatment is often unpredictable. The purpose of
this study was to investigate the biodegradability of natural collagen membranes.
Three non-cross-linked resorbable collagen barrier membranes were tested: Derma
Fina (porcine dermis), Evolution Standard (equine pericardium) and Duo-Teck
(equine lyophilized collagen felt). 10 × 10 mm2 pieces of membranes were
submitted to three different degradation procedures: (1) hydrolytic degradation
in phosphate buffer solution, (2) enzyme resistance, using a 0.25% porcine
trypsin solution, and (3) bacterial (Clostridium histolyticum) collagenase
resistance test. Weight measurements were performed with an analytic
microbalance. Thickness was measured with a digital caliper. Membranes were
analyzed at different time-points, up to 21 d of immersion. A stereomicroscope
was used to obtain membranes' images. ANOVA and Student Newman Keuls were used
for mean comparisons (p < 0.05), except when analyzing differences between
time-points within the same membrane and solution where pair-wise comparisons
were applied (p < 0.001). Derma Fina attained the highest resistance to all
degradation challenges. Duo-Teck was the most susceptible membrane to
degradation, complete degradation occurred as soon as 8 h. The bacterial
collagenase solution performed as the most aggressive test as all membranes
presented 100% degradation before 21 d.
