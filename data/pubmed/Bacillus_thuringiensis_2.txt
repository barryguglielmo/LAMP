Weevils are significant pests of horticultural crops and are largely managed with
insecticides. In response to concerns about negative impacts of synthetic
insecticides on humans and the environment, entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) have
been developed as an alternative method of control, and as such appear to be
"ready-made" components of integrated pest management (IPM) programs. As the
success of pest control requires a thorough knowledge of the biology of the
pests, this review summarises our current knowledge of weevil biology on nut
trees, fruit crops, plant storage roots, and palm trees. In addition, three
groups of life cycles are defined based on weevil developmental habitats, and
together with information from studies of EPF activity on these groups, we
discuss the tactics for integrating EPF into IPM programs. Finally, we highlight 
the gaps in the research required to optimise the performance of EPF and provide 
recommendations for the improvement of EPF efficacy for the management of key
weevils of horticultural crops.
