Here we have investigated whether bacterial challenges to larval stages of Aedes 
aegypti can influence the adults' immune and vector competence for dengue and
Zika viruses. We show that larval exposure to live Bacillus thuringiensis
Berliner and Enterobacter ludwigii can result in the modulation of virus
infection at the adult stage in the absence of bacterial carry-over between the
two developmental stages. We observed a significant reduction in virus infection 
intensity in the mosquitoes exposed to bacteria as larvae but not re-exposed as
adults. The pattern of immune gene transcript regulation after bacterial exposure
varied between adults, depending on whether or not they had been exposed to
bacteria as larvae. Adults exposed to bacteria as larvae showed an earlier immune
gene mRNA enrichment when re-exposed as adults than did adults not exposed as
larvae. Bacterial exposure of larvae appears to have only modest effects on adult
fitness.
