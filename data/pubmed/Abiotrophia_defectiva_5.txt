This article showcases a young patient who presented with STEMI secondary to
septic emboli due to endocarditis with Abiotrophia Defectiva in the setting of a 
congenital bicuspid aortic valve. We aim to discuss current considerations for
STEMI in young individuals including embolism due to IE, especially in patients
with known or suspected congenital heart valve disease.
