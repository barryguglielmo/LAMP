PURPOSE: Total exenteration of the orbit with removal of the eye globe and
surrounding tissues is most frequently indicated for malignant tumors. The
indications for exenteration of the orbit for benign orbital lesion are rare. Not
adequately treated infection of the orbit by systemic antibiotics can lead to
destructive changes of soft tissues in the region of the orbit and partial
exenteration with eyelid sparing technique is necessary.
DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
METHODS: Data of all patients between 2010 and 2018 who underwent exenteration of
the orbit for periocular lesions infiltrating the region of the orbit were
reviewed for patient demographics, previous treatment options, tumor localization
and histopathologic type.
RESULTS: In group of 14 patients with periocular lesions total orbital
exenteration underwent 12 patients (86%), in 1 patient biorbital exenteration was
performed and in one patient orbital exenteration with eyelid sparing technique
was performed. For 2 patients (14%) orbital exenteration was the first surgical
procedure performed. In the group of total exenteration in 12 cases
histopathologically basal cell carcinoma from eyelids was confirmed, in one case 
squamous cell epibulbar carcinoma was confirmed and in 1 case subtotal
exenteration with eyelid sparing technique was performed-the authors reported the
case.Case report of patient with long inflammation of the lacrimal pathway
leading to orbital inflammation with eye globe destruction and partial
exenteration with eyelids sparing technique was indicated. A 75-year-old man
presented in 2014 with blepharoconjunctivitis and lacrimal sac inflammation of
the left side. Treated in outpatient tract with local antibiotics, the drainage
lacrimal system was transient. Few months later developed chronic
blefaroconjunctivitis in cultivation result Citrobacter koseri positive was
found. Patient was treated only with local therapy at outpatient tract again. In 
2017 sent to hospital with painful eye-globe, visual acuity was no light
perception. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance presented soft tissue mass
extending along the medial orbit region in the m.rect. medialis and m. obliquus
sup. and partly also m. rect. inf. space as a lesion of size 23 Ã— 30 mm with a
slight postcontrast homogeneous saturation and this lesion tightly fitted to the 
eyeball. Exenteration with lid sparing technique was performed. In 2019 after
healing process patient got an individual epithesis.
CONCLUSIONS: Basal cell carcinoma is the most frequent indication of orbital
exenteration. Rarely is indicated subtotal exenteration with eyelid sparing
technique for non-cancer reason as it was in our 1 case.
