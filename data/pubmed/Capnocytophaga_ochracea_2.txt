Periodontal disease is a chronic infectious disease, which is characterized by
the damaged dental hard tissue by lactic acid generated by microorganisms after
the fermentation of carbohydrates rich diet. The risk of periodontal disease is
known to be higher in diabetic patients. We compared the diversity of five
commonly occurring dental bacteria including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella
forsythia, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Prevotella intermedia, and Aggregatibacter
actinomycetemcomitans in 14 type-2 diabetic patients and equal numbers of healthy
controls. The subgingival samples were collected using sterile paper points. We
used 16S rRNA sequence specific primers for PCR-based identification of dental
bacteria. Our results showed that A. actinomycetemcomitans was completely absent 
in control subjects but present in 43% of diabetic patients. C. ochracea was
highly prevalent in diabetic patients (100%) as compared to controls (28.5%). The
frequency of other three bacterial species was also higher in diabetic patients
than control subjects. These findings indicate that dental bacteria are highly
prevalent in subgingival pockets of diabetic patients. Therefore, proper
monitoring of diabetic patients for dental care is important to prevent bacterial
growth and its sequela in risky individuals. Further case-control studies using
larger sample size would help in validating the association between oral diseases
and diabetes.
