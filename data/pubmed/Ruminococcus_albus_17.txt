Here, we demonstrated the immobilization of bacterial feruloyl esterase (FAE)
from Butyrivibrio sp. XPD2006, Lactobacillus crispatus, Butyrivibrio sp. AE2015, 
Ruminococcus albus, Cellulosilyticum ruminicola and Clostridium cellulovorans on 
SBA-15 and their ability to synthesize butyl ferulate (BFA). The BFae2 from
Butyrivibrio sp. XPD2006 showed the best catalytic efficiency. High BFA yield was
produced when the immobilization of BFae2 took place with a high protein loading 
and narrow pore sized SBA-15, suggesting alteration of enzyme behavior due to the
crowding environment in SBA-15. Grafting of SBA-15 with octyl moieties led to
shrinking pore size and resulted in 2.5-fold increment of BFA activity compared
to the free enzyme and 70%mol BFA was achieved. The BFae2 encapsulated in
hydrophobic-modified SBA-15 endured up to seven reaction cycles while the BFA
activity remained above 60%. This is the first report showing the superior
performance of hydrophobic-modified surface to entrap FAE to produce fatty
phenolic esters.
