Background and Objective: The potential of probiotics on the prevention and
control of periodontitis and other chronic inflammatory conditions has been
suggested. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species influence P. gingivalis
interaction with gingival epithelial cells (GECs) but may not act in a unique
way. In order to select the most appropriate probiotic against P. gingivalis, we 
aimed to evaluate the effect of several strains on Porphyromonas gingivalis
biofilm formation and transcription virulence-associated factors (PgVAFs).
Methods: Cell-free pH neutralized supernatants (CFS) and living Lactobacillus
spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. were tested against P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 and
W83, in mono- and multi-species (with Streptococcus oralis and S. gordonii)
biofilms. Relative transcription of P. gingivalis genes (fimA, mfa1, kgp, rgp,
ftsH and luxS) was determined in biofilms and under GECs co-infection.
Results: Probiotics CFS reduced P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 levels in mono-species
biofilms and living probiotics reduced P. gingivalis abundance in multi-species
biofilms. L. acidophilus LA5 down-regulated transcription of most PgVAFs in
biofilms and GECs.
Conclusions: Probiotics affect P. gingivalis biofilm formation by down-regulating
overall PgVAFs with the most pronounced effect observed for L. acidophilus LA5.
