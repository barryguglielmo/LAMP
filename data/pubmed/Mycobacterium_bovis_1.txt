BACKGROUND: Intravesical administration of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) has
proven useful for treatment and prevention of recurrence of superficial bladder
cancer and in situ carcinoma. However, fatal side effects such as disseminated
infections may occur. Early diagnosis and accurate therapy for interstitial
pneumonitis (IP) are important because exacerbation of IP triggered by infections
is the major cause of death. Although some fatality reports have suggested newly 
appeared IP after intravesical BCG treatment, to our knowledge, there are no
reports which have demonstrated acute exacerbation of existing IP. Moreover,
autopsy is lacking in previous reports. We report the case of a patient with
fatal IP exacerbation after BCG instillation and the pathological findings of the
autopsy.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 77-year-old man with a medical history of IP was referred to
our hospital because of fever and malaise. He had received an intravesical
injection of BCG 1 day before the admission. His fever reduced after the use of
antituberculosis drugs, so he was discharged home. He was referred to our
hospital again because of a high fever 7 days after discharge. On
hospitalisation, he showed high fever and systemic exanthema. Hepatosplenomegaly 
and myelosuppression were also observed. Biopsies revealed multiple epithelioid
cell granulomas with Langhans giant cells of the liver and bone marrow. Biopsy
DNA analyses of Mycobacterium bovis in the bone marrow, sputum, and blood were
negative. His oxygen demand worsened drastically, and the ground-glass shadow
expanded on the computed tomography scan. He was diagnosed with acute
exacerbation of existing IP. We recommenced the antituberculosis drugs with
steroid pulse therapy, but he died on day 35 because of respiratory failure. The 
autopsy revealed a diffuse appearance of multiple epithelioid cell granulomas
with Langhans giant cells in multiple organs, although BCG was not evident.
CONCLUSIONS: We report the first case of acute exacerbation of chronic IP by BCG 
infection. This is also the first case of autopsy of a patient with acute
exacerbation of existing IP induced by intravesical BCG treatment. Whether the
trigger of acute IP exacerbation is infection or hypersensitivity to BCG is still
controversial, because pathological evidence confirming BCG infection is lacking.
Physicians who administer BCG against bladder cancer should be vigilant for acute
exacerbation of IP.
