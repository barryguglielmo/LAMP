In the current study, we show that biofilm formation by various strains and
species belonging to Bifidobacterium, a genus that includes gut commensals with
reported health-promoting activities, is induced by high concentrations of bile
(0.5% (w/v) or higher) and individual bile salts (20Â mM or higher), rather than
by acid or osmotic stress. The transcriptomic response of a bifidobacterial
prototype Bifidobacterium breve UCC2003 to such high bile concentrations was
investigated and a random transposon bank of B. breve UCC2003 was screened for
mutants that affect biofilm formation in order to identify genes involved in this
adaptive process. Eleven mutants affected in their ability to form a biofilm were
identified, while biofilm formation capacity of an insertional mutation in luxS
and an exopolysaccharide (EPS) negative B. breve UCC2003 was also studied.
Reduced capacity to form biofilm also caused reduced viability when exposed to
porcine bile. We propose that bifidobacterial biofilm formation is an adaptive
response to high concentrations of bile in order to avoid bactericidal effects of
high bile concentrations in the gastrointestinal environment. Biofilm formation
appears to be a multi-factorial process involving EPS production, proteins and
extracellular DNA release, representing a crucial strategy in response to bile
stress in order to enhance fitness in the gut environment.
