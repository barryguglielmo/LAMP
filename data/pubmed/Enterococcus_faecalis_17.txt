Transition metals are essential trace elements and their high-affinity uptake is 
required for many organisms. Metal transporters are often characterised using
metal-sensitive fluorescent dyes, limiting the metals and experimental conditions
that can be studied. Here, we have tested whether metal transport by Enterococcus
faecalis MntH2 can be measured with an electrophysiology method that is based on 
the solid-supported membrane technology. E. faecalis MntH2 belongs to the Natural
Resistance-Associated Macrophage Protein (Nramp) family of proton-coupled
transporters, which transport divalent transition metals and do not transport the
earth metals. Electrophysiology confirms transport of Mn(II), Co(II), Zn(II) and 
Cd(II) by MntH2. However, no uptake responses for Cu(II), Fe(II) and Ni(II) were 
observed, while the presence of these metals abolishes the uptake signals for
Mn(II). Fluorescence assays confirm that Ni(II) is transported. The data are
discussed with respect to properties and structures of Nramp-type family members 
and the ability of electrophysiology to measure charge transport and not directly
substrate transport.
