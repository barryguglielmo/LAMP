CASE: A 57-year-old man presented with a Mycobacterium fortuitum prosthetic joint
infection (PJI) after right total hip arthroplasty refractory to the initial
revision surgery and cement spacer placement. The patient was subsequently
treated with 2-stage total joint arthroplasty revision surgery using an
antibiotic-laden spacer customized to include meropenem and delayed
reimplantation to allow for prolonged, systemic antimicrobial treatment with
multiple antimicrobials, including levofloxacin and linezolid.
CONCLUSIONS: There is little evidence to guide practitioners in the diagnosis and
treatment of PJI caused by rare, rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) such as M.
fortuitum. This case demonstrates a successful strategy for the treatment of RGM 
PJI.
