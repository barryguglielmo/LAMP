This research aimed to evaluate the effect of acid stress on the expression of
stress regulator (grxB and rpoS) and virulence (ompA, hfq, and cpa) genes of
Cronobacter sakazakii Yrt2a. The results showed that C. sakazakii Yrt2a
experienced decrease in number during acid stress and was no longer culturable
90 min post exposure to pH 3.0. During acid stress, the expression of grxB, rpoS,
ompA, cpa and hfq was upregulated by 2.15; 2.19; 1.55; 1.1 and 1.41 log,
respectively. However, all genes expression was downregulated when the bacteria
entered the unculturable state. The expression of gene grxB, rpoS, ompA, cpa
decreased to 1.04; 0.37; 0.84 and 1.71 log, respectively; while hfq gene
expression reached a level lower than that of control. This research implies a
supposition that during acid stress, C. sakazakii was capable of maintaining its 
culturability and pathogenicity until they are no longer culturable.
