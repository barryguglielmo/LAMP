A new bio-conjugate nano-silver enzyme conjugate complex (BC-nAg-Akp) was
formulated containing alkaline protease (Akp). The present research involved
synthesis of nAg particles in acetone concentrated enzyme sol using 0.005 M AgNO3
solution formed within interaction time of 24 h through photo catalysis. The
BC-nAG-Akp composite exhibited 1.9-fold increase in enzyme activity. The
formulation was characterized using techniques viz., SEM, SEM-EDS, TEM, and DLS
spectroscopy. The TEM analysis revealed synthesis of silver nano rods with size
dimensions ranging from 40 to 80 nm. Likewise, the mean hydrodynamic diameter was
114 nm with polydispersity index of 0.260 and had the largest diffusion constant 
of 4.28 × 108 amongst the three forms of the formulation (crude, acetone
concentrated and partially purified) on DLS characterization. The SEM-EDS
analysis showed occurrence of 18.32 and 3.79%weight and %atom of Ag element
respectively. The prepared formulation was investigated for its dehairing
performance. The ideal dehairing was achieved at 37 °C after 12 h of treatment.
The histopathological studies revealed that complete dehairing with minimal
rarefication was achieved and was found perform better compared to the commercial
Akp and control (crude enzyme) formulations.
