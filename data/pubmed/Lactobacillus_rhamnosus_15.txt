Here, we report the draft genome sequence of Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain
CBC-LR1, which was isolated from naturally processed, homemade dairy foods in
Bulgaria. The genome was assembled in 29 contigs with a total length of
2,892,155 bp and a GC content of 46.7%. Genome annotation predicted 2,638 coding 
genes and 49 tRNA genes.
