The EtOAc extract of Artemisia argyi-derived Fungus Trichoderma koningiopsis QA-3
showed potent inhibitory activity against pathogenic bacteria. Fractionation of
the extract resulted in the isolation of three new polyketides (1-3) and two new 
terpenoids (4 and 5), together with three known metabolites (6-8). Their chemical
structures were analytically analyzed by NMR spectra, ECD, HRESIMS or HREIMS,
optical rotation, and X-ray crystallographic data, as well as by comparison with 
literature reports. In the antibacterial assays, 3-hydroxyharziandione (4) showed
potent activity against human pathogen Escherichia coli with MIC value of 0.5
µg/mL, while 6-(3-hydroxypent-1-en-1-yl)-2H-pyran-2-one (7) exhibited strong
activity against marine-derived aquatic pathogen Micrococcus luteus with MIC
value of 1.0 µg/mL.​.
