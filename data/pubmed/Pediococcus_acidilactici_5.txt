BACKGROUND: Probiotics and antispasmodics have been tested extensively in the
management of symptoms of irritable bowel disease (IBS) but they have rarely been
evaluated in combination. The objective of this pilot study was to assess the
efficacy of treatment with the probiotic formulation i3.1 (Lactobacillus
plantarum CECT7484 and CECT7485; Pediococcus acidilactici CECT7483), with or
without the addition of the antispasmodic alverine/simethicone, in improving
IBS-related quality of life (QoL) and reducing abdominal pain and diarrhea in
patients with IBS.
METHODS: Randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial with three parallel arms
(probiotic, probiotic plus antispasmodic, placebo). Patients with IBS (N=55) were
recruited at the Gastroenterology Department of the Juárez Hospital (México
City). QoL was assessed with the IBS-QoL questionnaire, abdominal pain with a
visual analog scale, and stool consistency with the Bristol scale.
RESULTS: The IBS-QoL rate of response (ITT analysis) was 50.0% for patients in
the group with probiotic alone, 68.4% in the group with probiotic plus
antispasmodic, and 16.7% in group with placebo after 6 weeks of treatment
(p=0.005). Response to abdominal pain was reported by 38.9% patients treated with
probiotic, 57.9% with probiotic plus antispasmodic, and 16.7% with placebo
(p=0.035). Regarding stool consistency, a response to treatment was reported by
44.4% of patients treated with probiotic, 57.9% with probiotic plus
antispasmodic, and 16.7% with placebo (p=0.032).
CONCLUSION: The results are consistent with previous studies on the use of the
i3.1 probiotic formulation for the management of symptoms in IBS patients, and
the addition of an antispasmodic improves its observed effects.
