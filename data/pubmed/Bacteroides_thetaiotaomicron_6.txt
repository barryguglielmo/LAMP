Densely O-glycosylated mucin domains are found in a broad range of cell surface
and secreted proteins, where they play key physiological roles. In addition,
alterations in mucin expression and glycosylation are common in a variety of
human diseases, such as cancer, cystic fibrosis, and inflammatory bowel diseases.
These correlations have been challenging to uncover and establish because tools
that specifically probe mucin domains are lacking. Here, we present a panel of
bacterial proteases that cleave mucin domains via distinct peptide- and
glycan-based motifs, generating a diverse enzymatic toolkit for mucin-selective
proteolysis. By mutating catalytic residues of two such enzymes, we engineered
mucin-selective binding agents with retained glycoform preferences. StcEE447D is 
a pan-mucin stain derived from enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli that is
tolerant to a wide range of glycoforms. BT4244E575A derived from Bacteroides
thetaiotaomicron is selective for truncated, asialylated core 1 structures
commonly associated with malignant and premalignant tissues. We demonstrated that
these catalytically inactive point mutants enable robust detection and
visualization of mucin-domain glycoproteins by flow cytometry, Western blot, and 
immunohistochemistry. Application of our enzymatic toolkit to ascites fluid and
tissue slices from patients with ovarian cancer facilitated characterization of
patients based on differences in mucin cleavage and expression patterns.
