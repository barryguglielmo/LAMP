The outbreaks of Cronobacter sakazakii, Salmonella spp, and Bacillus cereus in
powdered foods have been increasing in worldwide. However, an effective method to
pasteurize powdered foods before consumption remains lacking. A prototype Intense
Pulsed Light (IPL) system was developed to disinfect powdered foods under
different IPL and environmental conditions. Synergistic effect of IPL and TiO2
photocatalysis on microbial inactivation was studied. The results show that high 
energy intensity of each pulse, high peak intensity, and short pulsed duration
contributed to a high microbe inactivation. With TiO2 photocatalysis, one
additional log10 reduction was achieved, bringing the total log reduction to
4.71 ± 0.07 (C. sakazakii), 3.49 ± 0.01 (E. faecium), and 2.52 ± 0.10 (B. cereus)
in non-fat dry milk, and 5.42 ± 0.10 (C. sakazakii), 4.95 ± 0.24 (E. faecium),
2.80 ± 0.23 (B. cereus) in wheat flour. IPL treatment combined with the TiO2
photocatalysis exhibits a strong potential to reduce the energy consumption in
improving the safety of powdered foods.
