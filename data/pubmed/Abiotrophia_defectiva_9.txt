Double-Valve Heart Disease and Glomerulonephritis Consequent to Abiotrophia
defectiva Endocarditis.

Elashery AR, Stratidis J, Patel AD.

Abiotrophia defectiva, a nutritionally deficient streptococcus, is a rare cause
of infective endocarditis. It has been associated with hemophagocytic syndrome.
We present the first case of A. defectiva infective endocarditis that led to
antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated glomerulonephritis. The patient
was a 55-year-old man whose endocarditis affected the mitral and aortic valves.
His course was complicated by atrial fibrillation, stroke, and
glomerulonephritis. He was successfully treated with antibiotics and dual valve
replacement.
