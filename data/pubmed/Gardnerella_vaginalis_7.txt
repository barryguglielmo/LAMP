Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is characterized by the presence of a polymicrobial
biofilm where Gardnerella vaginalis plays a key role. Previously, we demonstrated
that Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM (French National Collection of Cultures of
Microorganisms) I-3856 is helpful in resolving experimental simulated BV in mice.
In this study, we analyzed its capacity to affect G. vaginalis biofilms and to
potentiate the activity of standard antimicrobial agents. We also investigated
the anti-biofilm activity of Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG (ATCC 53103), a
well-known strain for its intestinal healthy benefits. Biofilm biomass was
assessed by crystal violet staining, and G. vaginalis viability was assessed by a
colony forming unit (CFU) assay. Here, for the first time, we demonstrated that
S. cerevisiae CNCM I-3856 as well as L. rhamnosus GG were able (i) to
significantly inhibit G. vaginalis biofilm formation, (ii) to markedly reduce G. 
vaginalis viability among the biomass constituting the biofilm, (iii) to induce
disaggregation of preformed biofilm, and (iv) to kill a consistent amount of
bacterial cells in a G. vaginalis preformed biofilm. Furthermore, S. cerevisiae
CNCM I-3856 strongly potentiates the metronidazole effect on G. vaginalis biofilm
viability. These results suggest that S. cerevisiae CNCM I-3856 as well as L.
rhamnosus GG could be potential novel therapeutic agents against bacterial
vaginosis.
