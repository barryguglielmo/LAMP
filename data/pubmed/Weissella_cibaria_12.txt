Microbial polysaccharides can find distinct applications as stabilizer agents
including synthesis of nanoparticles. In this study, a dextran-type
exopolysaccharide (EPS) was used as the stabilizer agent for the green synthesis 
of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs-Dex) with antimicrobial characteristics. UV-vis
spectroscopy analysis was used to test the formation of AgNPs-Dex. The uniform
morphology at around 10 nm size was observed for AgNPs-Dex by TEM analysis and
importantly EDX analysis demonstrated the embedment of Ag+ ions within dextran as
the stabilizer agent. XRD analysis confirmed the crystalline nature of AgNPs-Dex 
and FTIR analysis demonstrated the interactions of dextran functional groups with
silver. DSC and TGA analysis showed the alteration in the thermal stability of
AgNPs-Dex compared to the stabilizer dextran. The antibacterial and antifungal
activities of AgNPs-Dex were determined against food originated pathogenic
bacteria and fungi and important inhibition levels were observed at 1 mg ml-1
concentration of AgNPs-Dex and this activity was observed to be concentration
dependent.
