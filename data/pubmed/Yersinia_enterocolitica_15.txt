We report here the complete genome sequence and characterization of Yersinia
bacteriophage vB_YenP_ϕ80-18. ϕ80-18 was isolated in 1991 using a Y.
enterocolitica serotype O:8 strain 8081 as a host from a sewage sample in Turku, 
Finland, and based on its morphological and genomic features is classified as a
podovirus. The genome is 42 kb in size and has 325 bp direct terminal repeats
characteristic for podoviruses. The genome contains 57 predicted genes, all
encoded in the forward strand, of which 29 showed no similarity to any known
genes. Phage particle proteome analysis identified altogether 24 phage
particle-associated proteins (PPAPs) including those identified as structural
proteins such as major capsid, scaffolding and tail component proteins. In
addition, also the DNA helicase, DNA ligase, DNA polymerase, 5'-exonuclease, and 
the lytic glycosylase proteins were identified as PPAPs, suggesting that they
might be injected together with the phage genome into the host cell to facilitate
the take-over of the host metabolism. The phage-encoded RNA-polymerase and
DNA-primase were not among the PPAPs. Promoter search predicted the presence of
four phage and eleven host RNA polymerase -specific promoters in the genome,
suggesting that early transcription of the phage is host RNA-polymerase dependent
and that the phage RNA polymerase takes over later. The phage tolerates pH values
between 2 and 12, and is stable at 50°C but is inactivated at 60°C. It grows
slowly with a 50 min latent period and has apparently a low burst size. Electron 
microscopy revealed that the phage has a head diameter of about 60 nm, and a
short tail of 20 nm. Whole-genome phylogenetic analysis confirmed that ϕ80-18
belongs to the Autographivirinae subfamily of the Podoviridae family, that it is 
93.2% identical to Yersinia phage fHe-Yen3-01. Host range analysis showed that
ϕ80-18 can infect in addition to Y. enterocolitica serotype O:8 strains also
strains of serotypes O:4, O:4,32, O:20 and O:21, the latter ones representing
similar to Y. enterocolitica serotype O:8, the American pathogenic biotype 1B
strains. In conclusion, the phage ϕ80-18 is a promising candidate for the
biocontrol of the American biotype 1B Y. enterocolitica.
