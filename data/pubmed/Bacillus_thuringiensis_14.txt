Several different agricultural insect pests have developed field resistance to Bt
(Bacillus thuringiensis) proteins (ex. Cry1Ac, Cry1F, etc.) expressed in crops,
including corn and cotton. In the bollworm, Helicoverpa zea, resistance levels
are increasing; recent reports in 2019 show up to 1000-fold levels of resistance 
to Cry1Ac, a major insecticidal protein in Bt-crops. A common method to analyze
global differences in gene expression is RNA-seq. This technique was used to
measure differences in global gene expression between a Bt-susceptible and
Bt-resistant strain of the bollworm, where the differences in susceptibility to
Cry1Ac insecticidal proteins were 100-fold. We found expected gene expression
differences based on our current understanding of the Bt mode of action,
including increased expression of proteases (trypsins and serine proteases) and
reduced expression of Bt-interacting receptors (aminopeptidases and cadherins) in
resistant bollworms. We also found additional expression differences for
transcripts that were not previously investigated, i.e., transcripts from three
immune pathways-Jak/STAT, Toll, and IMD. Immune pathway receptors (ex. PGRPs) and
the IMD pathway demonstrated the highest differences in expression. Our analysis 
suggested that multiple mechanisms are involved in the development of
Bt-resistance, including potentially unrecognized pathways.
