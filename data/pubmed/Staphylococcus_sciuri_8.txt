Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are an important group of opportunistic
pathogenic microorganisms that cause infections in hospital settings and are
generally resistant to many antimicrobial agents. We report on phenotypic and
genotypic virulence characteristics of a select group of clinical, mecA-positive 
(encoding penicillin-binding protein 2a) CoNS isolates. All CoNS were resistant
to two or more antimicrobials with S. epidermidis strain 214EP, showing
resistance to fifteen of the sixteen antimicrobial agents tested.
Aminoglycoside-resistance genes were the ones most commonly detected. The
presence of megaplasmids containing both horizontal gene transfer and
antimicrobial resistance genetic determinants indicates that CoNS may disseminate
antibiotic resistance to other bacteria. Staphylococcus sciuri species produced
six virulence enzymes, including a DNase, gelatinase, lipase, phosphatase, and
protease that are suspected to degrade tissues into nutrients for bacterial
growth and contribute to the pathogenicity of CoNS. The PCR assay for the
detection of biofilm-associated genes found the eno (encoding laminin-binding
protein) gene in all isolates. Measurement of their biofilm-forming ability and
Spearman's rank correlation coefficient analyses revealed that the results of
crystal violet (CV) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) assays were
significantly correlated (œÅ = 0.9153, P = 3.612e-12). The presence of virulence
factors, biofilm-formation capability, extracellular enzymes, multidrug
resistance, and gene transfer markers in mecA-positive CoNS clinical strains used
in this study makes them powerful opportunistic pathogens. The study also
warrants a careful evaluation of nosocomial infections caused by CoNS and may be 
useful in studying the mechanism of virulence and factors associated with their
pathogenicity in vivo and developing effective strategies for mitigation.
