A strain SDU10 was isolated from swine manure compost and identified as
Pseudomonas stutzeri SDU10. It demonstrated excellent capability in NH4+-N
removal. Optimal conditions of NH4+-N removal were determined, which were sodium 
acetate as the optimal carbon source, carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio of 10,
temperature of 30 °C, pH of 7.0. Especially, P. stutzeri SDU10 could remove high 
concentration NH4+-N of 1500.0 and 2000.0 mg/l in 120 h with the NH4+-N removal
rates of 91.1% and 61.6%, respectively. In batch experiments, the highest NH4+-N 
removal rate of 97.6% and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rate of 94.2% were
obtained at initial C/N ratio 10 during piggery wastewater treatment using P.
stutzeri SDU10. Results showed that P. stutzeri SDU10 had the potential for
treatment of wastewater of high NH4+-N concentration.
