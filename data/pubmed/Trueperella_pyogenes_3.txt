BACKGROUND: The present study was designed to characterize phenotypically and
genotypically two Trueperella pyogenes strains isolated from an okapi (Okapia
johnstoni) and a royal python (Python regius).
CASE PRESENTATION: The species identity could be confirmed by phenotypic
properties, by MALDI-TOF MS analysis and by detection of T. pyogenes
chaperonin-encoding gene cpn60 with a previously developed loop-mediated
isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay. Furthermore, sequencing of the 16S
ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, the 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region (ISR), the
target genes rpoB encoding the β-subunit of bacterial RNA polymerase, tuf
encoding elongation factor tu and plo encoding the putative virulence factor
pyolysin allowed the identification of both T. pyogenes isolates at species
level.
CONCLUSIONS: Both strains could be clearly identified as T. pyogenes. The T.
pyogenes strain isolated in high number from the vaginal discharge of an okapi
seems to be of importance for the infectious process; the T. pyogenes strain from
the royal python could be isolated from an apparently non-infectious process.
However, both strains represent the first isolation of T. pyogenes from these
animal species.
