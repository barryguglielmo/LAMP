1,2,4-Butanetriol (BT) is used as a precursor for the synthesis of various
pharmaceuticals and the energetic plasticizer 1,2,4-butanetriol trinitrate. In
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, BT is biosynthesized from xylose via heterologous four 
enzymatic reactions catalyzed by xylose dehydrogenase, xylonate dehydratase,
2-ketoacid decarboxylase, and alcohol dehydrogenase. We here aimed to improve the
BT yield in S. cerevisiae by genetic engineering. First, the amount of the key
intermediate 2-keto-3-deoxy-xylonate as described previously was successfully
reduced in 41 % by multiple integration of Lactococcus lactis 2-ketoacid
decarboxylase gene kdcA into the yeast genome. Since the heterologous BT
synthetic pathway is independent of yeast native metabolism, this manipulation
has led to NADH/NADPH imbalance and deficiency during BT production.
Overexpression of the NADH kinase POS5Δ17 lacking the mitochondrial targeting
sequence to relieve NADH/NADPH imbalance resulted in the BT titer of 2.2 g/L (31 
% molar yield). Feeding low concentrations of glucose and xylose to support the
supply of NADH resulted in BT titer of 6.6 g/L with (57 % molar yield).
Collectively, improving the NADH/NADPH ratio and supply from glucose are
essential for the construction of a xylose pathway, such as the BT synthetic
pathway, independent of native yeast metabolism. This article is protected by
