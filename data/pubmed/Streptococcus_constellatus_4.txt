BACKGROUND: An intracardiac foreign body causing recurrent fungemia is a rare
clinical situation. Clinicians should be that aware of rare sources of sepsis
despite a thorough history and examination.
RESULTS: The authors describe a 63 year-old man, with unremarkable past medical
history, who presented with a fever for 2 weeks. Blood cultures persistently grew
Candida albicans and Streptococcus constellatus. Echocardiogram assessment showed
a suspected vegetation over the tricuspid valve. Surgical exploration with median
sternotomy and cardiopulmonary bypass revealed a tooth-pick impacted within the
right atrium surrounded by vegetation. The authors postulate accidental ingestion
of the foreign body and translocation into the right atrium via the esophagus and
thoracic cavity.
CONCLUSION: Surgical removal of symptomatic intracardiac foreign bodies is highly
recommended.
