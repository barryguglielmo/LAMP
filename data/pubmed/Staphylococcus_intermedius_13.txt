OBJECTIVES: To evaluate matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time of
flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) combined with the Sepsityper kit (Bruker 
Daltoniks GmbH, Bremen) for the direct detection of bacterial species from
inoculated blood cultures from dogs and cats.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Canine and feline blood samples were inoculated with
typical sepsis-causing bacteria such as Staphylococcus intermedius,
Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus canis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia
coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at two distinct concentrations (each in
triplicate), resulting in 72 blood culture bottles incubated at 37°C. Samples
were comparatively analysed with MALDI-TOF MS after preparation with the
Sepsityper kit and also by standard bacteriology (culturing and biochemical
characterisation).
RESULTS: Bacterial species identified from agar plates and by MALDI-TOF MS from
blood culture bottles were identical for all samples. The MALDI Biotyper software
(Bruker Daltoniks) correctly identified all bacterial strains from inoculated
canine and feline blood with analysis indicating very good precision.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: MALDI-TOF MS analysis combined with the Sepsityper kit is 
a reliable tool for a quick detection of veterinary-relevant bacterial species
directly from blood culture bottles. This approach could reduce the time for
identification of critical species to only 24 hours.
