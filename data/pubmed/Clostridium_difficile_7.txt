Introduction: Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile is a Gram+, anaerobic,
spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium that can produce toxins, and it is mainly
because its virulence is attributed. The objective of this study was to evaluate 
the presence of C. difficile and hyper virulent ribotypes in chicken carcasses
and the antibiotic susceptibility of isolated strains.
Material and Methods: C. difficile was isolated from chicken carcasses by
microbiological methods, its ribotypes were identified by means of PCR, the toxin
production ability was defined by ELISA, and the susceptibility of the isolates
to selected antibiotics was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration
evaluator strips.
Results: The bacterium was isolated from 69 out of 185 (37.3%) examined chicken
carcass samples, and six out of the 69 (8.7%) isolates were identified as
ribotype 027. All isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid
(100.0%), vancomycin (97.1%), metronidazole (88.4%), and tetracycline (95.7%),
whereas they were resistant to cefotaxime (97.1%) and imipenem (89.9%).
Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate the presence of toxigenic C.
difficile isolates such as ribotype 027 (one of the most common causes of C.
difficile infection in humans) in chicken carcasses. Although there is no case
for stating that C. difficile is a food-borne pathogen, the presence of C.
difficile in chicken may be considered to be a potential risk to consumers.
