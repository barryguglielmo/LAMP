BACKGROUND: Vaginal yeast is frequently found with Lactobacillus-dominant
microbiota. The relationship between vaginal yeast and other bacteria has not
been well characterized.
METHODS: These analyses utilized data from the Preventing Vaginal Infections
trial. Relative abundance of vaginal bacteria from 16S rRNA gene amplicon
sequencing and quantities of 10 vaginal bacteria using taxon-directed PCR assays 
were compared at visits with and without detection of yeast on microscopy,
culture, or both.
RESULTS: Higher relative abundances of Megasphaera species type 1 (RR 0.70, 95%CI
0.52-0.95), Megasphaera species type 2 (RR 0.81, 95%CI 0.67-0.98) and
Mageeibacillus indolicus (RR 0.46, 95%CI 0.25-0.83), were associated with lower
risk of detecting yeast. Conversely, higher relative abundances of
Bifidobacterium bifidum, Aerococcus christensenii, Lactobacillus mucosae,
Streptococcus equinus/infantarius/lutentiensis, Prevotella bivia, Dialister
propionicifaciens, and Lactobacillus crispatus/helveticus were associated with
yeast detection. Taxon-directed assays confirmed that increasing quantities of
both Megasphaera species and M. indolicus were associated with lower risk of
detecting yeast while, increasing quantities of L. crispatus were associated with
higher risk of detecting yeast.
CONCLUSION: Despite an analysis that examined associations between multiple
vaginal bacteria and the presence of yeast, only a small number of vaginal
bacteria were strongly and significantly associated with the presence or absence 
of yeast.
