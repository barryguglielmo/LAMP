Most Mycobacterium fortuitum infections described involve direct inoculation
through skin lesions. We describe the case of a patient without risk factors who 
presented with an intracranial mass and a pulmonary infection with M. fortuitum
As M. fortuitum are rarely pathogens, there is little knowledge about the optimal
treatment and outcome of such infections: what is the best mode of
administration, what is the best therapy duration and is surgery always required 
are some of the unanswered questions. In our patient, surgical removal of the
mass associated with a 1-year antimycobacterial therapy led to a full recovery.
Even though M. fortuitum was rapidly identified in sputum, it was initially
considered non-pathogenic and the definitive diagnosis required almost 6 weeks of
investigations. New molecular techniques will probably lead to more
identifications of M. fortuitum in the next few years and a better knowledge of
their possible pathogenicity and optimal treatment.
