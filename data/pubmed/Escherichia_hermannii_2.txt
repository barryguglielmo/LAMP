This study dealt with the influence of the temperature on the bacterial dynamics 
of two spontaneously fermented wheat sourdoughs, propagated at 21 ± 1 °C (SD1)
and 30 ± 1 °C (SD2), during nine backslopping steps (BS1 to BS9). Proteobacteria 
was the only phylum found in flour. Escherichia hermannii was predominant,
followed by Kosakonia cowanii, besides species belonging to the genera Pantoea
and Pseudomonas. After one step of propagation, Clostridium and Bacillus cereus
group became predominant. Lactobacillus curvatus was found at low relative
abundance. For the second backslopping step, Clostridium was flanked by L.
curvatus and Lactobacillus farciminis. From BS4 (6th day) onward, lactic acid
bacteria (LAB) became predominant. L. farciminis overcame L. curvatus and
remained dominant until the end of propagations for both sourdoughs. At 21 °C,
Bacillus, Clostridium, Pseudomonas, and Enterobacteriaceae were gradually
inhibited. At the end of propagation, SD1 harbored only LAB. Otherwise, the
temperature of 30 °C favored the persistence of atypical bacteria in SD2, as
Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae. Therefore, the temperature of 21 °C was more 
suitable for sourdough propagation in Brazil. This study enhanced the knowledge
of temperature's influence on microbial assembly and contributed to the
elucidation of sourdough microbial communities in Brazil.
