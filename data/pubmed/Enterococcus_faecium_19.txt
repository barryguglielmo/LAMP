Because Enterococcus faecium is an important nosocomial pathogen and sentinel
organism for tracking antimicrobial resistance, information on the contamination 
and antimicrobial resistance patterns of E. faecium in food are essential to
public health and food safety. We analyzed the occurrence of E. faecium in retail
pork meat products (n = 124), and antimicrobial resistance of 30 E. faecium
isolates were examined against 14 antimicrobials using the broth dilution test
and disc diffusion test. Rep-PCR-based molecular diversity was also analyzed
using Deviersilab. The highest contamination of enterococci was observed for
minced pork meat but most of the E. faecium was isolated from meatball-type
frozen pork meat products (FP). Incidences of antimicrobial-resistant E. faecium 
against erythromycin, clindamycin and nitrofurantoin were 80%, 50% and 20%,
respectively. No vancomycin-resistant enterococci were analyzed. Rep-PCR showed
distinctive clusters with a similarity â‰¥ 98%, consisting of 18 E. faecium
isolates from FP manufactured in seven companies. The analyzed data on the
contamination and antimicrobial resistance patterns combined with molecular
typing can be useful to derive risk management of antimicrobial-resistant
enterococci in food.
