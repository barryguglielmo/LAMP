We present the first reported case of prosthetic joint infection caused by
Clostridium bifermentans, which was treated with total joint washout and
debridement allowing for the patient to retain his prosthesis and achieve full
recovery. Clostridium bifermentans is a gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming
bacterium. This organism was once considered to be non-pathogenic, but has
recently been associated with cases of septic arthritis, empyema, osteomyelitis, 
soft tissue infection, brain abscess, bacteremia and endocarditis.
