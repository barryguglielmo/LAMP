Bacillus velezensis strain BZR 336g is a plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium
isolated from a winter wheat rhizoplane from the Krasnodar region in Russia. In
this study, we report the genome, including genes with known phenotypic function,
i.e., the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites with fungicidal and plant
growth-promoting activities. We sequenced and analyzed the complete BZR 336g
genome using two different DNA preparation methods to help us better understand
the origin of the antimicrobial and antifungal abilities and to weigh the
biocontrol properties of this strain.
