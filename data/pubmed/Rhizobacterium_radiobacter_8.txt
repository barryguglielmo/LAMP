Agrobacterium (Rhizobium) radiobacter is a gram-negative bacillus rarely
implicated in ocular disease. A 79-year-old male who performed extensive yardwork
following intravitreal injection with aflibercept for diabetic macular edema
developed endophthalmitis caused by Agrobacterium radiobacter on post-injection
day 7. The patient was treated with vitreous tap and intravitreal injection of
vancomycin and ceftazidime with clearance of the infection and restoration of his
baseline visual acuity at 20/80.
