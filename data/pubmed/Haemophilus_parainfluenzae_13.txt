INTRODUCTION: Infectious cellulitis is a common disease, mostly affecting the
lower extremities and the face but only rarely the genitalia.
OBSERVATION: A 24-year-old male patient presented with acute erythematous edema
of the penile shaft and foreskin present for 48hours. Gentle retraction of the
foreskin revealed a short frenulum with a small area (2-3mm) of erosion. He had
had unprotected genital and orogenital sex three days before with his usual
female partner and reported tearing of the frenulum during intercourse.
Ampicillin-sensitive Haemophilus parainfluenzae was isolated from the swab taken 
from the erosion of the frenulum. Clinical remission was obtained following oral 
administration of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid.
DISCUSSION: We describe not only the first case of Haemophilus
parainfluenzae-associated cellulitis of the penis but also the first report of
penile cellulitis following erosion of a short frenulum during sexual
intercourse.
