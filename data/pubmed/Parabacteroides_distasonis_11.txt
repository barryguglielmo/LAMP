Propolis has beneficial effects anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetes and anti-obesity
in human or murine models, but its mechanism has not been fully elucidated. This 
study was to investigate the effects of ethanol extract of propolis (EEP) on the 
gut microbiota, and to analyze the associations between these alterations of gut 
microbiota and insulin resistance and obesity in high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice.
Male C57BL/6J mice were fed with chow diet, high-fat diet, and high-fat diet
supplemented with 1% EEP or 2%EEP. EEP supplementation reduced HFD-induced weight
gain and liver fat accumulation, proinflammatory cytokines and insulin
resistance, and improved glucose tolerance and lipid profile. Meanwhile, EEP
supplementation in HFD-fed mice increased anti-obesity and anti-inflammatory
bacteria such as genera Roseburia and Intestinimonas and species Parabacteroides 
goldsteinii and Parabacteroides distasonis, and reduced pro-inflammatory bacteria
such as genera Faecalibaculum and Prevotella and species Bacteroides vulgatus.
These dominant bacterial taxa altered by EEP were significantly associated with
the metabolic parameters of insulin resistance and obesityin HFD-fed mice. The
results in this study indicated that EEP reduced HFD-induced obesity and insulin 
resistant, which may be mediated by modulating the composition and function of
gut microbiota.
