BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the impact of Bifidobacterium animalis ssp.
lactis CNCM I-3446, Bovine Milk-derived OligoSaccharides (BMOS) and their
combination on infant gut microbiota in vitro. In addition, a novel strategy
consisting of preculturing B. lactis with BMOS to further enhance their potential
synbiotic effects was assessed.
METHOD: Short-term fecal batch fermentations (48 h) were used to assess the
microbial composition and activity modulated by BMOS alone, B. lactis grown on
BMOS or dextrose alone, or their combinations on different three-month-old infant
microbiota.
RESULTS: BMOS alone significantly induced acetate and lactate production (leading
to pH decrease) and stimulated bifidobacterial growth in 10 donors. A further
in-depth study on two different donors proved B. lactis ability to colonize the
infant microbiota, regardless of the competitiveness of the environment. BMOS
further enhanced this engraftment, suggesting a strong synbiotic effect. This was
also observed at the microbiota activity level, especially in a donor containing 
low initial levels of bifidobacteria. In this donor, preculturing B. lactis with 
BMOS strengthened further the early modulation of microbiota activity observed
after 6 h.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the strong synbiotic effect of BMOS and B.
lactis on the infant gut microbiota, and suggests a strategy to improve its
effectiveness in an otherwise low-Bifidobacterium microbiota.
