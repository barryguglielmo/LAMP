BACKGROUND: Infantile oxalosis, the most devastating form of primary
hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1), often leads to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) during 
the first weeks to months of life.
CASE-DIAGNOSIS: Here, we report the outcome of the therapeutic use of Oxalobacter
formigenes (Oxabact OC5; OxThera AB, Stockholm, Sweden) in a female infant with
PH1 who exhibited severely elevated plasma oxalate (Pox) levels, pronounced
nephrocalcinosis, anuretic end-stage renal disease, and retinal oxalate deposits.
Following the diagnosis of PH1 at an age of 8 weeks, a combined regimen of daily 
peritoneal dialysis, daily pyridoxine treatment and hemodialysis (3 times a week)
was unable to reduce the pronounced hyperoxalemia. After the addition of
Oxalobacter formigenes therapy to the otherwise unchanged treatment regimen, Pox 
levels first stabilized and subsequently declined from 130 μmol/L to around 80
μmol/L. Nephrocalcinosis and retinal deposits stabilized. Oxalobacter formigenes 
treatment was well-tolerated and no related adverse events were observed. The
patient showed nearly age-appropriate growth and development and received
successful combined liver-kidney transplantation at the age of two years.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with O. formigenes combined with intensive dialysis led to
reduction of Pox, stabilization of systemic oxalosis, and improvement in the
clinical disease course. O. formigenes treatment may be an option for reduction
of oxalosis in infantile patients with insufficient response to conservative
treatments until combined liver-kidney transplantation can be performed.
