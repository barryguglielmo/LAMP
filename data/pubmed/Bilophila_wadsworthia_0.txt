PURPOSE: Our recent study has reported that whole mung bean showed better
beneficial effects on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and gut microbiota
disorders when compared with the decorticated mung bean at the same intervention 
dose level, suggesting that the mung bean seed coat (MBC) may play a crucial role
in its health benefits. This study aims to investigate whether MBC has beneficial
benefits on the prevention of HFD-induced obesity and the modulation of gut
microbiota in mice when it was supplemented in HFD.
METHODS: Herein, male C57BL/6 J mice were fed with normal control diet, HFD, and 
HFD supplemented with MBC (3-6%, w/w) for 12 weeks. The changes in physiological,
histological, biochemical parameters, serum endotoxin, proinflammatory cytokines,
and gut microbiota composition of mice were determined to assess the ability of
MBC to alleviate HFD-induced obesity and modulate gut microbiota disorders in
mice.
RESULTS: MBC supplementation exhibited significant reductions in the HFD-induced 
adiposity, fat accumulation, serum lipid levels, lipopolysaccharide, and
proinflammatory cytokines concentrations (P < 0.05), which was accompanied by
improvements in hepatic steatosis and adipocyte size. Especially, the elevated
fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance were also significantly improved by 
MBC supplementation (P < 0.05). Furthermore, high-throughput sequencing of the
16S rRNA gene revealed that MBC could normalize HFD-induced gut microbiota
dysbiosis. MBC not only could promote the bloom of Akkermansia, but also restore 
several HFD-dependent taxa (Blautia, Ruminiclostridium_9, Bilophila, and
unclassified_f_Ruminococcaceae) back to normal status, co-occurring with the
decreases in obesity-related indices.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that MBC may be mainly responsible for 
the beneficial effects of whole mung bean on preventing the HFD-induced changes, 
thus enlarging the application value of MBC.
