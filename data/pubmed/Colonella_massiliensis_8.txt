BACKGROUND/AIMS: Stress is closely related to the deterioration of digestive
disease. Melatonin has potent anti-inflammatory properties. The objective of this
study was to determine the effect of water stress (WS) and sleep deprivation (SD)
on intestinal microbiota and roles of melatonin in stressful condition.
METHODS: We used C57BL/6 mice and specially designed water bath for stress and SD
for 10 days. We measured melatonin concentrations in serum, feces, and colon
tissues by high-performance liquid chromatography. Genomic DNA was extracted from
feces and amplified using primers targeting V3 to V4 regions of bacterial 16S
ribosomal RNA genes.
RESULTS: Compared to the control, melatonin concentration was lower in the WS and
SD. Fecal concentration was 0.132 pg/mL in control, 0.062 pg/mL in WS, and 0.068 
pg/mL in SD. In colon tissue, it was 0.45 pg/mL in control, 0.007 pg/mL in WS,
and 0.03 pg/mL in SD. After melatonin treatment, melatonin concentrations in
feces and colon tissue were recovered to the level of control. Metagenomic
analysis of microbiota showed abundance in colitogenic microbiota in WS and SD.
Melatonin injection attenuated this harmful effect. WS and SD showed decreased
Lactobacillales and increased Erysipelotrichales and Enterobacteriales. Melatonin
treatment increased Akkermansia muciniphila and Lactobacillus and decreased
Bacteroides massiliensis and Erysipelotrichaceae.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that stress and SD could affect intestinal
dysbiosis and increase colitogenic microbiota, which could contribute to the
aggravating digestive disease. Melatonin concentrations in feces and colon tissue
decreased under WS and SD. Melatonin treatment brought recovery of melatonin
concentration in colon tissue and modulating dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota.
