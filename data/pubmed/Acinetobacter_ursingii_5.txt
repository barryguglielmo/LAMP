BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Acinetobacter is an aerobic, gram-negative coccobacillus,
which causes nosocomial infections including bacteremia. Recent development of
molecular techniques has made classification of the Acinetobacter genomospecies
possible, but there are still only a few studies comparing clinical features of
the subspecies. We investigated bacteremia caused by Acinetobacter, isolated
subspecies, and compared clinical features for each group.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of Acinetobacter bacteremia cases was made in a
900-bed hospital in Japan. In addition to conventional procedures, subspecies
identification based on rpoB sequence was made, and comparison of clinical
characteristics between each subspecies were analyzed.
RESULTS: We collected 35 cases (Acinetobacter baumannii 14, A. nosocomialis 12,
Acinetobacter ursingii 6, and A. seifertii 3). All of the A. seifertii bacteremia
cases were blood stream infection occurring in cerebrovascular disease patients, 
showing particularly higher incidence of shock (100%) and high Pitt bacteremia
score (PBS) (6.33 ± 2.52) in comparison to A. baumannii (43% and 2.86 ± 2.25,
respectively). Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and the PBS were 
slightly higher in A. nosocomialis in comparison to A. baumannii, and the 7 day
mortality rate was higher in A. nosocomialis (25%) than in A. baumannii (7%),
though this difference was not found to be significant.
CONCLUSIONS: A.seifertii, the recently defined novel species, showed distinctive 
clinical features of bacteremia. And, in contrast to previous studies, the
severity of A. nosocomialis infection was not lower than that of A. baumannii,
which might suggest the influence of local epidemiology. Further characterization
of these subspecies should be continued.
