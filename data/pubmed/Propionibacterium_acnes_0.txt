A 46-year-old woman with uveitis was referred to our respiratory diseases
department in July 2018. Her medical history included transient bilateral hilar
mediastinal lymphadenopathy (BHL) and multiple pulmonary nodules in May 2013
during pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin treatment for chronic hepatitis C
infection. Five years post-treatment, chest X-ray revealed BHL and nodular
recurrence. A biopsy of the subcutaneous buttock nodules revealed scattered
non-caseating epithelioid granulomas with positive PAB immunohistochemical
staining. This seem to be the first report of Propionibacterium acnes-associated 
sarcoidosis possibly initially triggered by interferon-alpha therapy.
Understanding the mechanisms underlying interferon-triggered P. acnes-associated 
sarcoidosis may clarify the sarcoidosis immunopathogenesis.
