[FeFe] hydrogenases are highly active hydrogen conversion catalysts but are
notoriously sensitive to oxidative damage. Redox hydrogels have been used for
protecting hydrogenases from both high potential inactivation and oxygen
inactivation under turnover conditions. However, [FeFe] hydrogenase containing
redox hydrogels must be fabricated under strict anoxic conditions. Sulfide
coordination at the active center of the [FeFe] hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio
desulfuricans protects this enzyme from oxygen in an inactive state, which can be
reactivated upon reduction. Here, we show that this oxygen-stable inactive form
of the hydrogenase can be reactivated in a redox hydrogel enabling practical use 
of this highly O2 sensitive enzyme without the need for anoxic conditions.
