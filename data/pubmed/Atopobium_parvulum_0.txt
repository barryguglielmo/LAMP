The gut microbiota may have an impact on obesity. To date, the majority of
studies in obese patients reported microbiota composition in stool samples. The
aim of this study was to investigate the duodenal mucosa dysbiosis in adult obese
individuals from Campania, a region in Italy with a very high percentage of obese
people, to highlight microbial taxa likely associated with obesity. Duodenum
biopsies were taken during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in 19 obese (OB) and 
16 lean control subjects (CO) and microbiome studied by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
Duodenal microbiome in our groups consisted of six phyla: Proteobacteria,
Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Acidobacteria.
Proteobacteria (51.1% vs. 40.1%) and Firmicutes (33.6% vs. 44.9%) were
significantly (p < 0.05) more and less abundant in OB compared with CO,
respectively. Oribacterium asaccharolyticum, Atopobium parvulum and Fusobacterium
nucleatum were reduced (p < 0.01) and Pseudomonadales were increased (p < 0.05)
in OB compared with CO. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed
Atopobium and Oribacterium genera able to discriminate with accuracy (power = 75%
and 78%, respectively) OB from CO. In conclusion, increased Proteobacteria and
decreased Firmicutes (Lachnospiraceae) characterized the duodenal microbiome of
obese subjects. These data direct to further studies to evaluate the functional
role of the dysbiotic-obese-associated signature.
