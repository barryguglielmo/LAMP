AIM: In this study, we investigated the anti-osteoporotic effect of two fermented
milk products (FMPs) fermented by Lactobacillus plantarum A41 and Lactobacillus
fermentum SRK414 on a rat model of ovariectomy-induced post-menopausal primary
osteoporosis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The two Lactobacillus FMPs increased the bone volume and
bone mineral density (BMD) in ovariectomized (OVX) rats, and normalized the bone 
biomarkers in the serum. Additionally, they altered the gene expression levels of
bone metabolism-related markers. Furthermore, the two Lactobacillus FMPs down
regulated bone apoptosis-related genes stimulated by ovariectomy. Interestingly, 
the Lactobacillus FMPs decreased the levels of inflammation markers in the serum,
bone, ileum, and colon of the rats. Gut bacterial populations were also affected 
upon FMP treatment due to increase in the abundance of the genus Lactobacillus
and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii.
CONCLUSIONS: Milk products fermented by L. plantarum A41 and L. fermentum SRK414 
can exhibit anti-osteoporotic effects on post-menopausal osteoporosis via
regulating the expression of bone metabolism-related markers.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: The two Lactobacillus FMPs used in the study
can be an ideal method that has its potential of treating post-menopausal
osteoporosis instead of drug treatments.
