Phytases are important commercial enzymes that catalyze the dephosphorylation of 
myo-inositol hexakisphosphate (phytate) to its lower inositol phosphate (IP)
esters, IP6 to IP1. Digestion of phytate by Citrobacter braakii 6-phytase
deviates significantly from monophasic Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Analysis of
phytate digestion using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) using the single
injection method produced a thermogram with two peaks consistent with two periods
of high enzyme activity. Continuous-flow electrospray ionization time-of-flight
mass spectroscopy (ESI-ToF-MS) provided real-time analysis of phytase catalysis. 
It was able to show that the first two cleavage steps were rapid and concurrent
but the third cleavage step from IP4 to IP3 was slow. The third (IP4 to IP3),
fourth (IP3 to IP2) and fifth (IP2 to IP1) cleavages were effectively sequential 
due to the preferred association of the more phosphorylated species with the
phytase catalytic site. This created a bottleneck during the cleavage of IP4 to
IP3 until the point at which IP4 was exhausted and was followed by the rapid
cleavage of IP3 to IP2, which was observed as the second peak in the ITC
thermogram. This work illustrates the importance of an orthogonal approach when
studying non-specific or complex enzyme catalyzed reactions.
