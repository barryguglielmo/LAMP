Two recent reports suggested that the less common, less virulent enterococcal
species, Enterococcus gallinarum and E. casseliflavus, with low-level vancomycin 
resistance due to chromosomally encoded vanC1 and vanC2/3, may influence host
immunity. We reported that peri-transplant gut colonization with E. gallinarum
and E. casseliflavus is associated with lower mortality after allogeneic
hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Because most acute leukemia patients
undergoing HCT have received intensive chemotherapy (usually requiring prolonged 
hospitalization) for their underlying disease before HCT, we hypothesized that
some may have acquired vanC-positive enterococci during chemotherapy. Therefore, 
we evaluated the presence of the vanC gene cluster using vanC1 and vanC2/3 qPCR
in thrice-weekly collected stool samples from 20 acute leukemia patients
undergoing intensive chemotherapy. We found that an unexpectedly large proportion
of patients have detectable vanC1 and vanC2/3 (15% and 35%, respectively) in at
least one stool sample. Comparing qPCR results with 16S rRNA gene sequencing
results suggested that E. gallinarum may reach high abundances, potentially
persisting into HCT and influencing transplant outcomes.
