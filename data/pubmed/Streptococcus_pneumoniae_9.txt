Background and Objectives: Streptococcus pneumoniae causes many lethal
infections. Due to its reduced sensitivity to commonly used antibiotics,
development of new strategies against pneumococcal infections seems to be
necessary. We aimed to investigate immunodominant antigens in S. pneumoniae
culture supernatant in order to develop novel targets for pneumococcal vaccines.
Materials and Methods: In this study S. pneumoniae ATCC49619 was sub-cultured
into BHI broth from overnight culture at 37°C for 4 h. The supernatant proteins
were precipitated using acetone precipitation method. A rabbit was
intramuscularly immunized with alum adjuvant and 100 μg pneumococcal supernatant 
proteins, 6 times at 14 days' intervals to produce hyperimmune serum. ELISA assay
was performed to determine the antibody level response to pneumococcal secretory 
proteins. Then dot blot applied for rapid evaluation of hyperimmune serum
reactivity to pneumococcus supernatant proteins. The western blot was also used
to determine the interaction of supernatant proteins with immunogenic rabbit's
hyperimmune-serum.
Results: According to the western blot analysis, the immunodominant protein had
140KDa molecular weight and designated as pneumococcal secretory protein140
(Psp140).
Conclusion: The Psp140 protein in the supernatant of S. pneumoniae culture is an 
immunodominant protein and it is likely related to pneumococcal secretory protein
or surface exposed protein which released into culture supernatant during
bacterial growth.
