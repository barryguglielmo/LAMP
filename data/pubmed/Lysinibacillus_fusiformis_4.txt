The current study was designed to isolate, identify and characterize a Bacillus
sp. capable of producing protease and exhibiting antifungal activity. A highly
potent bacterium capable of producing protease abundantly was isolated from the
soil collected from the waste pit near Microbiology Laboratory of Birendra
Multiple Campus, Bharatpur and later on identified as Lysinibacillus fusiformis
strain SK on the basis of morphological, physiological, biochemical and 16S rDNA 
gene sequencing techniques. The strain SK showed 98.36% similarity with L.
fusiformis strain NBRC 15717. Using R-programming statistical analysis tool, the 
optimum incubation time for the highest average protease production (APP) (47.2
U/mL) was found to be 22 h at 50 °C and both incubation time and temperature
showed a significant impact on the production of protease (P < 0.01). The maximum
average relative protease activity (ARPA) was observed at pH 7.8 and 48 °C,
whereas the least ARPA was observed in the presence of 80 g/L NaCl and 10 g/L
HgCl2 (P  < 0.01). The newly isolated bacterial strain also exhibited strong
antifungal activity against aflatoxigenic Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus
parasiticus suggesting that it can be a potential candidate for protease
production and activity over a wider range of temperature and pH as well as for
synthesizing effective antifungal compounds.
