Acetyl xylan esterase (AXE; E.C. 3.1.1.72) is one of the accessory enzymes for
xylan degradation, which can remove the terminal acetate residues from xylan
polymers. In this study, two genes encoding putative AXEs (LaAXE and BhAXE) were 
cloned from Lactobacillus antri DSM 16041 and Bacillus halodurans C-125, and
constitutively expressed in Escherichia coli. They possess considerable
activities towards various substrates such as p-nitrophenyl acetate,
4-methylumbelliferyl acetate, glucose pentaacetate, and 7-amino cephalosporanic
acid. LaAXE and BhAXE showed the highest activities at pH 7.0 and 8.0 at 50°C,
respectively. These enzymes are AXE members of carbohydrate esterase (CE) family 
7 with the cephalosporine-C deacetylase activity for the production of
antibiotics precursors. The simultaneous treatment of LaAXE with Thermotoga
neapolitana β-xylanase showed 1.44-fold higher synergistic degradation of
beechwood xylan than the single treatment of xylanase, whereas BhAXE showed no
significant synergism. It was suggested that LaAXE can deacetylate beechwood
xylan and enhance the successive accessibility of xylanase towards the resulting 
substrates. The novel LaAXE originated from a lactic acid bacterium will be
utilized for the enzymatic production of D-xylose and xylooligosaccharides.
