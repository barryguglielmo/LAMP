This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activities of two types
of insect fats extracted from black soldier fly larvae (HI, Hermetia illucens L.)
and yellow mealworm larvae (TM, Tenebrio molitor L.) and their effects as dietary
replacement of soybean oil (S) on cecal fermentation pattern, and fecal and cecal
microbiota in rabbits. A total of 120 weaned rabbits were randomly allotted to
three dietary treatments (40 rabbits/group) -a control diet (C diet) containing
1.5% of S and two experimental diets (HI diet (HID) and TM diet (TMD)), where S
was totally substituted by HI or TM fats during the whole trial that lasted 41
days. Regarding the in vitro antimicrobial activities, HI and TM fats did not
show any effects on Salmonella growth. Yersinia enterocolitica showed
significantly lower growth when challenged with HI fats than the controls. The
insect fat supplementation in rabbit diets increased the contents of the cecal
volatile fatty acids when compared to the control group. A metataxonomic approach
was adopted to investigate the shift in the microbial composition as a function
of the dietary insect fat supplementation. The microbiota did not show a clear
separation as a function of the inclusion, even if a specific microbial signature
was observed. Indeed, HI and TM fat supplementation enriched the presence of
Akkermansia that was found to be correlated with NH3-N concentration. An increase
in Ruminococcus, which can improve the immune response of the host, was also
observed. This study confirms the potential of HI and TM fats as antibacterial
feed ingredients with a positive influence on the rabbit cecal microbiota, thus
supporting the possibility of including HI and TM fats in rabbit diets.
