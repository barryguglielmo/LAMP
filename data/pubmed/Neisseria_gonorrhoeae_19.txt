BACKGROUND: Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae cases reached a
record high in the United States in 2018. Although active duty military
servicemembers have high rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea infection, trends in
chlamydia and gonorrhea in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) system have
not been previously described, including among patients with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and young women.
METHODS: We identified all Veterans in VHA care from 2009-2019. Tests and cases
of chlamydia and gonorrhea were defined based on lab results in the electronic
health record. Chlamydia and gonorrhea incidence rates were calculated each year 
by demographic group and HIV status.
RESULTS: In 2019, testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea occurred in 2.3% of
patients, 22.6% of women ages 18-24, and 34.1% of persons with HIV. 2019
incidence of chlamydia and gonorrhea was 100.8 and 56.3 cases per 100,000 VHA
users, an increase of 267% and 294%, respectively, since 2009. Veterans aged <34 
years accounted for 9.5% of the VHA population but 66.9% of chlamydia and 42.9%
of gonorrhea cases. Chlamydia and gonorrhea incidence rates in persons with HIV
were 1,432 and 1,687 per 100,000, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of chlamydia and gonorrhea rose dramatically from
2009-2019. Among tested persons, those with HIV had a 15.2-fold higher unadjusted
incidence of chlamydia and 34.9-fold higher unadjusted incidence of gonorrhea
compared to those without HIV. VHA-wide adherence to chlamydia and gonorrhea
testing in high-risk groups merits improvement.
