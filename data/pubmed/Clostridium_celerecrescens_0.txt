PURPOSE: We reviewed the clinical features of post-traumatic infections produced 
by Clostridium celerecrescens reported in the literature. C. celerecrescens is an
emerging pathogen involved in traumatic wound infection that progresses to deep
infection and osteomyelitis.
METHODS: We found only 4 cases reported in the literature with enough data to be 
analysed and we added our own case and experience with this type of infection.
The identification was performed by matrix-assisted desorption ionization-time of
flight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF) or API gallery, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing
were performed to confirm identification in all cases.
RESULTS: Identification of the bacteria is discrepant according to the method
used due to the genetic and phenotypic similarities of other species of the
genus. Identification through MALDI-TOF and API gallery is not suitable for
determining the specie, confirmation by 16S rRNA sequencing being necessary.
Treatment of the infection included complex antibiotic combinations and surgical 
treatment together with skin and soft tissue dressings due to the persistence of 
the pathogen over time.
CONCLUSION: This report supports the pathogenic role of C. celerecrescens in
post-traumatic infections and the need to improve the management of these
difficult-to-treat infections.
