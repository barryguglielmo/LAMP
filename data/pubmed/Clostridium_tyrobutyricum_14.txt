In this study, hyper-butanol producing Clostridium tyrobutyricum Δcat1::adhE2 was
used for butanol production from paper mill sludge (PMS) and corn steep liquor
(CSL). Our results demonstrated that CSL can not only serve as a cheap nitrogen
source, but also provide lactic acid that can be assimilated by C. tyrobutyricum 
for enhanced butanol production. Through a separate hydrolysis and fermentation, 
16.5 g/L butanol with a yield of 0.26 g/g was obtained from PMS hydrolysates
supplemented with 5% CSL. Further, a separate repeated hydrolysis was conducted
to improve PMS hydrolysis rate and enhance sugar yield. Fermentation using
hydrolysates from such process also generated high-level butanol with high yield.
Our results suggested an innovative bioprocess for efficient biobutanol
production from low-value waste streams.
