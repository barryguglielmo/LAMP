In the present study, an exopolysaccharide (EPS) producer Rhodococcus
erythropolis HX-2 was isolated from Xinjiang oil field, China. The HX-2 EPS (name
HPS) production reached 8.957 g/L by RSM in MSM medium. The HPS was purified by
ethanol precipitation and fractionation by DEAE-Cellulose and Sepharose column,
the yield of HPS was 3.736 g/L. HPS composed by glucose, galactose, fucose,
mannose and glucuronic acid. FT-IR spectroscopy indicated the presence of a large
amount of hydroxyl groups. NMR spectroscopy indicated the existence of both α and
β-configuration for sugar moieties present in HPS. The degradation temperature
(255.4 °C) of the HPS was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). A
reticular structure of HPS was observed by SEM and the AFM analysis of the HPS
revealed straight chains line. Meanwhile, the WSI and WHC of HPS were
92.15 ± 3.05% and 189.45 ± 5.65%, respectively. Finally, In vitro anticancer
activity purified EPS was evaluated on L929 normal cells, A549 cancer cells,
SMMC-7721 liver cancer cells and Hela cervical cancer cell. HPS inhibited the
growth of cancer cells in a certain concentration without damage to normal cells.
These characteristics indicate that its potential application value in food,
industry and pharmaceutical application.
