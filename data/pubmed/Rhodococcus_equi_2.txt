We document the causes and pathological findings in 50 cases of equine pneumonia 
and pleuritis in Southern Brazil. Suppurative (17/50), pyogranulomatous (14/50), 
aspiration (5/50), mycotic (4/50), bronchointerstitial (3/50), embolic (3/50) and
eosinophilic granulomatous pneumonia (1/50) and pleuritis (3/50) were the main
conditions identified. Streptococcus spp. were identified in 11 cases of
suppurative pneumonia. Suppurative pneumonia was further divided into acute
(8/17), subacute (6/17) and chronic (3/17) based on the morphological pattern of 
lesions. Rhodococcus equi was identified in all cases of pyogranulomatous
pneumonia and exclusively affected young foals.
