Septic arthritis of native joints is a potentially life-threatening disease. The 
most frequently isolated pathogens are Gram-positive cocci. Bacteroides fragilis 
is a rare pathogen in joint infections and is usually associated with
immunocompromised and debilitated patients. Most cases of B. fragilis joint
infection are related to skin or local perineal infections or are secondary to B.
fragilis bacteraemia from another source, for example from the gastrointestinal
tract. We present a clinical case of B. fragilis septic arthritis involving a
native hip joint in a previously healthy paraplegic patient.
