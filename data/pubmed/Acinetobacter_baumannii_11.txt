Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), an important nosocomial
pathogen, occurs particularly in the intensive care unit (ICU). Thus, the aim of 
this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of documented treatment with
colistin monotherapy versus colistin plus meropenem in critically ill patients
with CRAB infections at Chiang Mai University Hospital (CMUH). We conducted a
retrospective cohort study of critically ill patients with CRAB infections in an 
ICU from 2015 to 2017, who received colistin monotherapy versus colistin plus
meropenem. After propensity score matching, an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of a
30-day mortality rate in patients who received colistin plus meropenem was 0.43
compared to those who received colistin monotherapy (95% CI, 0.23-0.82, p =
0.01). aORs of clinical response and microbiological response were also higher in
patients who received colistin plus meropenem (1.81, 95% CI 1.01-3.26, p = 0.048 
and 2.08, 95% CI 1.11-3.91, p = 0.023, respectively). There was no significant
difference in nephrotoxicity (aOR, 0.76, 95% CI, 0.43-1.36, p = 0.363) between
colistin monotherapy and colistin plus meropenem. In conclusion, the addition of 
meropenem to colistin caused a reduction in 30-day mortality, higher clinical and
microbiological responses, and did not increase nephrotoxicity compared to
colistin monotherapy. Furthermore, 30-day mortality was significantly related
with age, receiving vasopressor, having malignancy, and the APACHE II score.
