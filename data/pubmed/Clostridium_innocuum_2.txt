Here, we report the complete genome sequence of Clostridium innocuum strain
LC-LUMC-CI-001. As recently as 2018, C. innocuum was generally considered a
benign gastrointestinal microorganism. This strain was isolated from the stool of
a patient with recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection-like illnesses.
