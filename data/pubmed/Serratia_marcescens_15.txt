This study introduces mCloverBlaster as a genetic tool to create deletions and
transcriptional and translational fusions in bacterial genomes using
recombineering. The major advantage of this system is that it can be used to make
deletions and fusions without leaving a selectable marker on the chromosome.
mCloverBlaster has a kanamycin resistance cassette with an I-SceI restriction
site flanked by fragments of the gene for the mClover3 fluorescent protein
including direct repeats of mClover3 sequence on both sides of the kanamycin
resistance gene. The mCloverBlaster sequence is introduced into the chromosome
using lambda red recombineering, expression of I-SceI creates a double stranded
break in the kanamycin resistance cassette that initiates a recombination event
that can occur in the mClover3 repeats. This recombination results in the
simultaneous removal of the kanamycin resistance gene and the restoration of a
functional mClover3 gene that can be used as a reporter. Here, this system was
used to replace the rcsB stress response gene in Serratia marcescens. The
resulting strain was tested for mClover3 fluorescence as a reporter for rcsB gene
expression and evaluated for pigment biosynthesis. In summary, mCloverBlaster is 
a molecular genetic tool to make markerless mClover3 fusions and gene deletions.
