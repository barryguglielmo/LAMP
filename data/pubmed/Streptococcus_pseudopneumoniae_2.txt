The aim of our study was to investigate phenotypic and genotypic features of
streptococci misidentified (misID) as Streptococcus pneumoniae, obtained over
20 years from hospital patients in Poland. Sixty-three isolates demonstrating
microbiological features typical for pneumococci (optochin susceptibility and/or 
bile solubility) were investigated by phenotypic tests, lytA and 16S rRNA gene
polymorphism and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). All isolates had a 6-bp deletion 
in the lytA 3' terminus, characteristic for Mitis streptococc and all but two
isolates lacked the pneumococcal signature cytosine at nucleotide position 203 in
the 16S rRNA genes. The counterparts of psaA and ply were present in 100% and
81.0% of isolates, respectively; the spn9802 and spn9828 loci were characteristic
for 49.2% and 38.1% of isolates, respectively. Phylogenetic trees and networks,
based on the multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) scheme, ribosomal multilocus
sequence typing (rMLST) scheme and core-genome analysis, clearly separated
investigated isolates from S. pneumoniae and demonstrated the polyclonal
character of misID streptococci, associated with the Streptococcus
pseudopneumoniae and Streptococcus mitis groups. While the S. pseudopneumoniae
clade was relatively well defined in all three analyses, only the core-genome
analysis revealed the presence of another cluster comprising a fraction of misID 
streptococci and a strain proposed elsewhere as a representative of a novel
species in the Mitis group. Our findings point to complex phylogenetic and
taxonomic relationships among S. mitis-like bacteria and support the notion that 
this group may in fact consist of several distinct species.
