Improving the antibacterial activity of nanomaterials and avoiding the use of
H2O2 are vital for biosecurity and public health. In this work, novel
Co4S3/Co(OH)2 hybrid nanotubes (HNTs) for the first time were successfully
synthesized through the control of Na2S treatment of Co(CO3)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10
precursor. On the basis of Kirkendall effect, acicular precursor was vulcanized
to form Co4S3/Co(OH)2 HNTs that possess great properties including favorable
storage ability and ideal stability. By tailoring the composition and structure, 
Co4S3/Co(OH)2 HNTs were found to have profound oxidase-like catalytic activities.
When pH = 3 precursor was treated with 900 mg of Na2S, Co4S3/Co(OH)2 HNTs exhibit
superior performance. Owing to the outstanding oxidase-like activity,
Co4S3/Co(OH)2 HNTs can eliminate Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
Staphylococcus sciuri, and Bacillus without the help of H2O2. It turned out that 
the sterilization ability came from the superoxide anion radical generated by
Co4S3/Co(OH)2 HNTs. With Co4S3/Co(OH)2 HNTs, the intracellular reactive oxygen
species level can be enhanced and the toxicity of H2O2 can be absolutely avoided.
Overall, the synthesis of antibacterial nanomaterials is unparalleled and the
results of this work would facilitate the utilization in medical science, new
energy, and environmental catalysis.
