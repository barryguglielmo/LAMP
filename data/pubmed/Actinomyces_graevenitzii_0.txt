Cigarette smoking affects the oral microbiome, which is related to various
systemic diseases. While studies that investigated the relationship between
smoking and the oral microbiome by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing have been
performed, investigations involving metagenomic sequences are rare. We
investigated the bacterial species composition in the tongue microbiome, as well 
as single-nucleotide variant (SNV) profiles and gene content of these species, in
never and current smokers by utilizing metagenomic sequences. Among 234 never
smokers and 52 current smokers, beta diversity, as assessed by weighted UniFrac
measure, differed between never and current smokers (pseudo-F = 8.44, R2 = 0.028,
p = 0.001). Among the 26 species that had sufficient coverage, the SNV profiles
of Actinomyces graevenitzii, Megasphaera micronuciformis, Rothia mucilaginosa,
Veillonella dispar, and one Veillonella sp. were significantly different between 
never and current smokers. Analysis of gene and pathway content revealed that
genes related to the lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway in Veillonella
dispar were present more frequently in current smokers. We found that
species-level tongue microbiome differed between never and current smokers, and 5
species from never and current smokers likely harbor different strains, as
suggested by the difference in SNV frequency.
