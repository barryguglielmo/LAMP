This study aimed to investigate the influence of sodium reduction and storage
temperature on the growth of total microbes and Bacillus cereus in naturally
contaminated hamburger patty and loaf bread, respectively. The sodium reduction
rate of hamburger patty and loaf bread was 20% and 30%, respectively, and
experimental samples were kept at 4 °C, 25 °C, and 40 °C for 60 h. The
microbiological analysis included the colony count of total microbes and B.
cereus. The water activity (Aw), titratable acidity (TA), and pH were assessed as
factors that inhibit microbial growth. In this study, Aw, TA, and pH of all
samples were affected by the growth of total microbes and B. cereus during the
storage period. Hence, these results suggested that sodium reduction in processed
foods should be preferentially applied as a potent inhibition strategy after
accurate assessment of inhibitors for different food types.
