Biogas plants are a widespread renewable energy technology. However, the use of
digestate for agronomic purposes has often been a matter of concern. It is
controversial whether biogas plants might harbor some pathogenic clostridial
species, which represent a biological risk. Moreover, the inhabitance of
Clostridium hard-cheese spoiling species in anaerobic digesters can be
problematic for hard-cheese manufacturing industries, due to the issue of cheese 
blowing defects. This study investigated the effect of mesophilic anaerobic
digestion processes on the Clostridium consortia distribution over time.
Specifically, three lab-scale CSTRs treating agricultural biomass were
characterized by considering both the whole microbial community and the
cultivable clostridial spores. It is assessed an overall reduction of the
Clostridium genus during the anaerobic digestion process. Moreover, it was
evidenced a slight, but steady decrease of the cultivable clostridial spores,
mainly represented by two pathogenic species, C. perfringens and C. bifermentans,
and one hard-cheese spoiling species, C. butyricum. Thus, it is revealed an
overall reduction of the clostridial population abundance after the mesophilic
anaerobic digestion treatment of agricultural biomass.
