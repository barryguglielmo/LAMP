Tetanus is a severe and potentially life-threatening infection caused by the
bacterium Clostridium Tetani. It is a gram-negative anaerobe, often found in soil
in spore form and in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals. It
produces a potent neurotoxin called tetanospasmin. The presence of this toxin on 
the affected wound contributes to its pathogenesis. In developed countries such
as the United Kingdom, tetanus poses a diagnostic challenge as cases are becoming
scarce and, therefore, difficult to diagnose in an acute setting following the
national immunisation programme in 1961. The prognosis of an acute tetanus can be
derived from several risk-stratifying scoring systems such as the Tetanus
Severity Score (TSS), with any score above 8 representing a 53% case-fatality
rate. Prompt clinical diagnosis, immediate delivery of treatment and strict
adherence to the national vaccination programme are paramount to suppress the
incidence and the fatality rate from tetanus.
