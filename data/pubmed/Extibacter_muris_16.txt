The caecum, an intestinal appendage in the junction of the small and large
intestines, displays a unique epithelium that serves as an exclusive niche for a 
range of pathogens including whipworms (Trichuris spp.). While protocols to grow 
organoids from small intestine (enteroids) and colon (colonoids) exist, the
conditions to culture organoids from the caecum have yet to be described. Here,
we report methods to grow, differentiate and characterise mouse adult stem
cell-derived caecal organoids, termed caecaloids. We compare the cellular
composition of caecaloids with that of enteroids, identifying differences in
intestinal epithelial cell populations that mimic those found in the caecum and
small intestine. The remarkable similarity in the intestinal epithelial cell
composition and spatial conformation of caecaloids and their tissue of origin
enables their use as an in vitro model to study host interactions with important 
caecal pathogens. Thus, exploiting this system, we investigated the responses of 
caecal intestinal epithelial cells to extracellular vesicles secreted/excreted by
the intracellular helminth Trichuris muris. Our findings reveal novel
immunoregulatory effects of whipworm extracellular vesicles on the caecal
epithelium, including the downregulation of responses to nucleic acid recognition
and type-I interferon signalling.
