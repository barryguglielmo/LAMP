A series consisting of new polyaminoisoprenyl derivatives were prepared in
moderate to good chemical yields varying from 32 to 64% according to two
synthetic pathways: (1) using a titanium-reductive amination reaction affording a
50/50 mixture of cis and trans isomers and (2) a direct nucleophilic substitution
leading to a stereoselective synthesis of the compounds of interest. These
compounds were then successfully evaluated for their in vitro antibiotic enhancer
properties against resistant Gram-negative bacteria of four antibiotics belonging
to four different families. The mechanism of action against Enterobacter
aerogenes of one of the most efficient of these chemosensitizing agents was
precisely evaluated by using fluorescent dyes to measure outer-membrane
permeability and to determine membrane depolarization. The weak cytotoxicity
encountered led us to perform an in vivo experiment dealing with the treatment of
mice infected with Salmonella typhimurium and affording preliminary promising
results in terms of tolerance and efficiency of the polyaminoisoprenyl derivative
5r/doxycycline combination.
