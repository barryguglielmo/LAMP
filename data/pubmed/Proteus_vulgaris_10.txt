OBJECTIVES: The bioaccumulation of keratinous wastes from poultry and dairy
industries poses a danger of instability to the biosphere due to resistance to
common proteolysis and as such, microbial- and enzyme-mediated biodegradation are
discussed.
RESULTS: In submerged fermentation medium, Proteus vulgaris EMB-14 utilized and
efficiently degraded feather, fur and scales by secreting exogenous keratinase.
The keratinase was purified 14-fold as a monomeric 49 kDa by DEAE-Sephadex A-50
anion exchange and Sephadex G-100 size-exclusion chromatography. It exhibited
optimum activity at pH 9.0 and 60 °C and was alkaline thermostable (pH 7.0-11.0),
retaining 87% of initial activity after 1 h pre-incubation at 60 °C. The Km and
Vmax of the keratinase with keratin azure were respectively 0.283 mg/mL and 0.241
U/mL/min. Activity of P. vulgaris keratinase was stimulated by Ca2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, 
Na+ and maintained in the presence of some denaturing agents, except
β-mercaptoethanol while Cu2+ and Pb2+ showed competitive and non-competitive
inhibition with Ki 6.5 mM and 17.5 mM, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This purified P. vulgaris keratinase could be surveyed for the
biotechnological transformation of bioorganic keratinous wastes into valuable
products such as soluble peptides, cosmetics and biodegradable thermoplastics.
