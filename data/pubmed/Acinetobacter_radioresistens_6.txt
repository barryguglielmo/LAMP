Many reports of the intestinal microbiota of grass carp have addressed the
microbial response to diet or starvation or the effect of microbes on metabolism;
however, the intestinal microbiota of crisp grass carp has yet to be elucidated. 
Moreover, the specific bacteria that play a role in the crispiness of grass carp 
fed faba beans have not been elucidated. In the present study, 16S sequencing was
carried out to compare the intestinal microbiota in the fore-, mid- and
hind-intestine segments of grass carp following feeding with either faba beans or
formula feed. Our results showed that (1) the hind-intestine presented
significant differences in diversity relative to the fore- or midintestine and
(2) faba beans significantly increased the diversity of intestinal microbiota,
changed the intestinal microbiota structure (Fusobacteria was reduced from 64.26%
to 18.24%, while Proteobacteria was significantly increased from 17.75% to
51.99%), and decreased the metabolism of energy, cofactors and vitamins in grass 
carp. Furthermore, at the genus and species levels, Acinetobacter accounted for
15.09% of the microbiota, and Acinetobacter johnsonii and Acinetobacter
radioresistens constituted 3.41% and 2.99%, respectively, which indicated that
Acinetobacter of the family Moraxellaceae contributed to changes in the
intestinal microbiota structure and could be used as a potential biomarker. These
results may provide clues at the intestinal microbiota level to understanding the
mechanism underlying the crispiness of grass carp fed faba beans.
