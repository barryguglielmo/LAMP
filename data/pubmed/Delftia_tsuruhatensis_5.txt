Polyphosphate kinase 2 (PPK2) transfer phosphate from inorganic polyphosphate to 
nucleotides. According to their activity, PPK2 enzymes are classified into three 
groups. Among them, class III enzymes catalyze both the phosphorylation of
nucleotide mono- to diphosphates and di- to triphosphates by using polyphosphate,
which is a very inexpensive substrate. Therefore, class III enzymes are very
attractive for use in biotechnological applications. Despite several studies on
class III enzymes, a detailed mechanism of how phosphate is transferred from the 
polyphosphate to the nucleotide remains to be elucidated. Herein, it is reported 
that PPK2 class III enzymes from two different bacterial species catalyze the
phosphorylation of adenosine mono- (AMP) into triphosphate (ATP) not only through
step-by-step phosphorylation, but also by pyrophosphorylation. These are the
first PPK2 enzymes that have been shown to possess polyphosphate-dependent
pyrophosphorylation activity.
