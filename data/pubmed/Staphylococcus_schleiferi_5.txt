The increase in canine skin and soft tissue infections, such as pyoderma and
otitis, caused by Staphylococcus schleiferi strains, is of significant zoonotic
concern. In this study, we report the first complete genome sequence for a
methicillin-resistant clinical isolate of S. schleiferi (MRSS) designated as SS4,
obtained from a dog with otitis externa, in Korea. The genome of SS4 strain was
of 2,539,409 bp and presented high G+C content ratio (35.90%) with no plasmid.
Comparative analysis of SS4 genome revealed that it is closely related to 2142-05
and 5909-02 strains isolated from the canine skin infections in the USA.
