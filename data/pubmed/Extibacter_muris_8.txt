Studies of controlled lab animals and natural populations represent two
insightful extremes of microbiota research. We bridged these two approaches by
transferring lab-bred female C57BL/6 mice from a conventional mouse facility to
an acclimation room and then to an outdoor enclosure, to investigate how the gut 
microbiota changes with environment. Mice residing under constant conditions
served as controls. Using 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal samples, we found that the
shift in temperature and humidity, as well as exposure to a natural environment, 
increased microbiota diversity and altered community composition. Community
composition in mice exposed to high temperatures and humidity diverged as much
from the microbiota of mice housed outdoors as from the microbiota of control
mice. Additionally, infection with the nematode Trichuris muris modulated how the
microbiota responded to environmental transitions: The dynamics of several
families were buffered by the nematodes, while invasion rates of two taxa
acquired outdoors were magnified. These findings suggest that gut bacterial
communities respond dynamically and simultaneously to changes within the host's
body (e.g. the presence of nematodes) and to changes in the wider environment of 
the host.
