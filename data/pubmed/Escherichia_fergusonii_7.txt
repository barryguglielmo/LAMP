Here, we report the complete genome sequence of colistin-resistant Escherichia
fergusonii strain EFCF056, isolated from chicken feces. This genome contains six 
plasmids, including a 204,246-bp plasmid harboring the colistin resistance gene
mcr-1 These results will increase our understanding of plasmid-mediated mcr-1
gene presence and transmission in E. fergusonii.
