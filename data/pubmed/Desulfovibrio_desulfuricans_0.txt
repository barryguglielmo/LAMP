Two strains of sulfate-reducing bacteria (J.5.4.2-L4.2.8T and J.3.6.1-H7) were
isolated from a pyrite-forming enrichment culture and were compared
phylogenetically and physiologically to the closest related type strain
Desulfovibrio sulfodismutans DSM 3696T. The isolated strains were vibrio-shaped, 
motile rods that stained Gram-negative. Growth occurred from 15 to 37°C and
within a pH range of 6.5-8.5. Both strains used sulfate, thiosulfate, sulfite,
and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as electron acceptor when grown with lactate.
Lactate was incompletely oxidized to acetate. Formate and H2 were used as
electron donor in the presence of acetate. Dismutation of thiosulfate and
pyrosulfite was observed. The two new isolates differed from D. sulfodismutans by
the utilization of DMSO as electron acceptor, 82% genome-wide average nucleotide 
identity (ANI) and 32% digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH), thus representing a 
novel species. The type strain of the type species Desulfovibrio desulfuricans
Essex6T revealed merely 88% 16S rRNA gene identity and 49% genome-wide average
amino acid identity (AAI) to the new isolates as well as to D. sulfodismutans.
Furthermore, the dominance of menaquinone MK-7 over MK-6 and the dominance of
ai-C15:0 fatty acids were observed not only in the two new isolated strains but
also in D. sulfodismutans. Therefore, the definition of a new genus is indicated 
for which the name Desulfolutivibrio is proposed. We propose for strains
J.5.4.2-L4.2.8T and J.3.6.1-H7 the name Desulfolutivibrio sulfoxidireducens gen. 
nov. sp. nov. with strain J.5.4.2-L4.2.8T defined as type strain. In addition, we
propose the reclassification of Desulfovibrio sulfodismutans as Desulfolutivibrio
sulfodismutans comb. nov.
