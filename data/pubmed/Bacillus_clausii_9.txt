The contamination of the aquatic environments by tetracycline antibiotics (TCs)
is an increasingly pressing issue. Here, we used the addition of exogenous
surfactants and in situ biosynthesis of biosurfactants to remove tetracycline
(TC), oxytetracycline (OTC), chlortetracycline (CTC), and their mixtures using
the co-culture of probiotic Bacillus clausii T and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens
HM618 producing surfactin. The addition of exogenous biosurfactants to remove TCs
was superior to nonionic surfactants. The maximal bio-removal efficiencies for
OTC and CTC among mixed antibiotics under the co-culture of B. clausii T and B.
amyloliquefaciens HM618 were 76.6% and 88.9%, respectively, which were both
better than the efficiency of the pure culture of B. clausii T. TCs were removed 
mainly through biotransformation rather than absorption and hydrolysis. The
removal efficiency was in the order CTC > OTC > TC. The co-culture of B. clausii 
T and B. amyloliquefaciens HM618 alleviated the cytotoxicity of OTC and CTC. The 
toxicity of the biotransformation products was lower than that of the parent
compounds. Demethylation, hydroxylation, and dehydration are likely the major
mechanisms of TC biotransformation. These results illustrate the potential of
using surfactants in the bioremediation of tetracycline antibiotics, and provide 
new avenues for further exploration of the bioremediation of antibiotics
pollution.
