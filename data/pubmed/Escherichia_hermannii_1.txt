Escherichia hermannii is a rare monomicrobial cause of infection in humans. E.
hermannii has never before been reported as the sole isolate from an infected
open tibia fracture. We present a case of E. hermannii infection after a type III
open tibia fracture. The patient was initially treated with irrigation and
debridement, open reduction internal fixation and primary wound closure. However,
after 8 weeks, he developed a draining wound and infection at the fracture site. 
He required a repeat debridement, hardware removal, external fixation and 6 weeks
of intravenous ceftriaxone for treatment. At 2-year follow-up, he remains
infection free, asymptomatic and continues to work with excellent functional
outcomes. This case adds to the growing literature that evidences E. hermannii as
an organism that can be pathogenic, virulent and cause monomicrobial infection.
