OBJECTIVES: To produce nattokinase in a food-grade expression system and evaluate
its thrombolytic activity in vitro.
RESULTS: No nattokinase activity from reconstituted strains was observed in
simulated gastric juice, but the enzyme was stable in intestinal fluid, the
relative activity of which was found to be 60% after 4 h. Due to the nattokinase 
being produced intracellularly by recombinant bacterial strains, the persistence 
of the bacteria in gastric juice ensured transmission of the nattokinase into
intestinal juice. Because of subsequent disintegration of the bacteria, the
highest nattokinase activity was observed after 3 h at approximately 32%,
following its carriage within the recombinant strains to the intestinal fluid.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that nattokinase from recombinant strains
exhibited good thrombolytic activity in vitro and may be used by the dairy
fermentation industry for the development of novel thrombolytic functional foods.
