Graphene-based materials have been demonstrated to facilitate electron
extracellular transfer (EET) of Shewanella. In this study, compared to group
lacking graphene oxide (GO)-based materials, GO films-added group and graphene
oxide/polyvinyl alcohol (GO/PVA) film-added group delivered 2.67- and 3.13-fold
increases in the Cr(VI) reduction by Shewanella xiamenensis, respectively. The
whole reduction process could be divided into three stages, including microbial
Cr(VI) reduction and GO reduction stage, microbial GO reduction stage and
microbial Cr(VI) reduction mediated by reduced graphene oxide (rGO) stage.
Moreover, gene analysis revealed that addition of GO and GO/PVA films stimulated 
overexpression of several c-type cytochrome (c-Cyts) genes, including mtrA, mtrB,
mtrC, mtrD, mtrE, mtrF, omcA, petC and SO-4047. Specifically, appreciable Cr(VI) 
reduction by the strains that overexpressed mtrA, mtrB, mtrC, mtrD, mtrE, mtrF
and omcA further confirmed that overexpression of c-Cyts genes indeed enhanced
the efficiency of Cr(VI) reduction. Based on these results, the specific function
of every c-Cyt was clearly found in Cr(VI) reduction by the induction of GO-based
materials. Our finding has disclosed a synergetic mechanism stimulated by
GO-based materials to enhance Cr(VI) bioreduction that was not only mediated
through the modification of material but also upregulated the expression of
functional genes.
