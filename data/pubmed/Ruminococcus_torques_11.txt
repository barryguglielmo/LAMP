Prophylactic or therapeutic antibiotic use along with chemotherapy treatment
potentially has a long-standing adverse effect on the resident gut microbiota. We
have established a case-control cohort of 32 pediatric and adolescent acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients and 25 healthy siblings (sibling controls) 
to assess the effect of chemotherapy as well as antibiotic prophylaxis on the gut
microbiota. We observe that the microbiota diversity and richness of the ALL
group is significantly lower than that of the control group at diagnosis and
during chemotherapy. The microbiota diversity is even lower in
antibiotics-exposed ALL patients. Although the gut microbial diversity tends to
stabilize after 1-year post-chemotherapy, their abundances were altered because
of chemotherapy and prophylactic antibiotic treatments. Specifically, the
abundances of mucolytic gram-positive anaerobic bacteria, including Ruminococcus 
gnavus and Ruminococcus torques, tended to increase during the chemotherapy
regimen and continued to be elevated 1 year beyond the initiation of
chemotherapy. This dysbiosis may contribute to the development of
gastrointestinal complications in ALL children following chemotherapy. These
findings set the stage to further understand the role of the gut microbiome
dynamics in ALL patients and their potential role in alleviating some of the
adverse side effects of chemotherapy and antibiotics use in immunocompromised
children.
