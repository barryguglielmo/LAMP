OBJECTIVE: To investigate the documentation of sepsis and a sense of urgency
throughout the acute care chain.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: Emergency department (ED) in a large district hospital in Heerlen, The
Netherlands.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants included patients ≥18 years with suspected sepsis who 
visited the ED during out-of-hours between September 2017 and January 2018
(n=339) and had been referred by a general practitioner and/or transported by
ambulance. We defined suspected sepsis as suspected or proven infection and the
presence of ≥2 quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment and/or ≥2 Systemic
Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria.
OUTCOME MEASURES: We analysed how often sepsis and a sense of urgency were
documented in the prehospital and ED medical records. A sense of urgency was
considered documented when a medical record suggested the need of immediate
assessment by a physician in the ED. We described documentation patterns
throughout the acute care chain and investigated whether documentation of sepsis 
or a sense of urgency is associated with adverse outcomes (intensive care
admission/30-day all-cause mortality).
RESULTS: Sepsis was documented in 16.8% of medical records and a sense of urgency
in 22.4%. In 4.1% and 7.7%, respectively, sepsis and a sense of urgency were
documented by all involved professionals. In patients with an adverse outcome,
sepsis was documented more often in the ED than in patients without an adverse
outcome (47.9% vs 13.7%, p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that in prehospital and ED medical records, sepsis
and a sense of urgency are documented in one out of five patients. In only 1 out 
of 20 patients sepsis or a sense of urgency is documented by all involved
professionals. It is possible that poor documentation causes harm, due to delayed
diagnosis or treatment. Hence, it could be important to raise awareness among
professionals regarding the importance of their documentation.
