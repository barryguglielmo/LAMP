In Paracatu, a city in Minas Gerais State (Brazil), the gold mineral extraction
produces wastes that contribute to environmental contamination by arsenic. This
work describes the evaluation of arsenic concentration from soil of a gold mining
area in Paracatu and the selection of arsenic resistant bacteria. In the process 
of culturing enrichment, 38 bacterial strains were isolated and the minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined in solid medium for each strain.
Three bacterial strains named P1C1Ib, P2Ic and P2IIB were resistant to
3000 mg L-1 of arsenite. Analysis of 16S rDNA gene sequences revealed that these 
bacteria belong to Bacillus cereus and Lysinibacillus boronitolerans species.
After cultivation of the strains P1C1Ib, P2Ic and P2IIIb, 69.38%-71.88% of
arsenite and 82.39%-85.72% of arsenate concentrations were reduced from the
culture medium, suggesting the potential application of theses strains in
bioremediation processes.
