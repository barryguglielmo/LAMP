Reports of unusual microorganisms causing human infections are on the rise due to
transitions in epidemiological trends. Commensal/normal flora which are otherwise
termed as 'good bacteria' are now causing infections in different group of
patients, mostly immunocompromised individuals. Various host and environmental
factors play a pivotal role in microbial transmigration from their normal habitat
into the blood and other body sites. We report one such 'good bacterium'
associated with sepsis in a patient who was given the same bacterium in the form 
of probiotics.
