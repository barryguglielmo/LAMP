As a critical factor involved in the maintenance of physiological homeostasis,
the gut microbiota (GM) reportedly plays a key role in bone development. To date,
the association between the GM and steroid deficiency-induced osteoporosis
remains poorly understood. Forty female Sprague Dawley rats were divided into an 
ovariectomy (OVX) or control group. We performed 16S rRNA and metagenome
sequencing, to compare diversity, taxonomic differences, and functional genes.
The GM composition did not change in the control group and the number of
operational taxonomic units increased significantly following ovariectomy. Alpha 
diversity, determined by ACE estimator, CHAO estimator, the Shannon index, and
the Simpson index showed an increasing trend after ovariectomy. Samples in the
OVX group were well clustered both pre- and post-ovariectomy, as demonstrated by 
principal coordinate 1 (PC1) and PC2. Functional genes of GM, including those
involved in synthesis and metabolism of carbohydrates and nucleotides, microbial 
structure, and heme, as well as hemin uptake and utilization, increased at the
early stage of osteoporosis. We observed that Ruminococcus flavefaciens exhibited
the greatest variation in abundance among the GM and this was also associated
with osteoclastic indicators and the estrobolome. Specific changes in fecal
microbiota are associated with the pathogenesis of steroid deficiency-induced
osteoporosis.
