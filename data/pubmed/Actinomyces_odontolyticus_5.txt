Oral microbiome research has moved from asking "Who's there?" to "What are they
doing?" Understanding what microbes "do" involves multiple approaches, including 
obtaining genomic information and examining the interspecies interactions.
Recently we isolated a human oral Saccharibacteria (TM7) bacterium, HMT-952,
strain TM7x, which is an ultrasmall parasite of the oral bacterium Actinomyces
odontolyticus. The host-parasite interactions, such as phage-bacterium or
Saccharibacteria-host bacterium, are understudied areas with large potential for 
insight. The Saccharibacteria phylum is a member of Candidate Phyla Radiation, a 
large lineage previously devoid of cultivated members. However, expanding our
understanding of Saccharibacteria-host interactions requires examining multiple
phylogenetically distinct Saccharibacteria-host pairs. Here we report the
isolation of 3 additional Saccharibacteria species from the human oral cavity in 
binary coculture with their bacterial hosts. They were obtained by filtering
ultrasmall Saccharibacteria cells free of other larger bacteria and inoculating
them into cultures of potential host bacteria. The binary cocultures obtained
could be stably passaged and studied. Complete closed genomes were obtained and
allowed full genome analyses. All have small genomes (<1 Mb) characteristic of
parasitic species and dramatically limited de novo synthetic pathway capabilities
but include either restriction modification or CRISPR-Cas systems as part of an
innate defense against foreign DNA. High levels of gene synteny exist among
Saccharibacteria species. Having isolates growing in coculture with their hosts
allowed time course studies of growth and parasite-host interactions by phase
contrast, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and scanning electron microscopy.
The cells of the 4 oral Saccharibacteria species are ultrasmall and could be seen
attached to their larger Actinobacteria hosts. Parasite attachment appears to
lead to host cell death and lysis. The successful cultivation of Saccharibacteria
species has significantly expanded our understanding of these ultrasmall
Candidate Phyla Radiation bacteria.
