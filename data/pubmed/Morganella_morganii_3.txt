Background: Morganella morganii is a species of Gram-negative enteric rod found
in normal human gut flora. Pathologically, this most often presents as urinary
tract infections, wound infections, and bacteremia. It is highly uncommon for M. 
morganii to be implicated in a central nervous system infection, with only 12
reported cases of parenchymal abscesses or meningitis.
Case Description: A previously healthy 13-month-old female presented with fever
of unknown origin and had a witnessed seizure during evaluation. A large left
subdural fluid collection was identified, and the patient underwent emergent burr
hole drainage and subdural drain placement. Cultures demonstrated M. morganii
empyema, and she subsequently completed a course of directed antibiotics. Six
months following surgery, she has no further clinical or radiographic evidence of
infection, seizures, or neurological sequelae.
Conclusion: We describe the first reported case of isolated subdural empyema
caused by M. morganii. The child was successfully treated with the evacuation of 
the empyema and direct antibiotics with no lasting neurological injury.
