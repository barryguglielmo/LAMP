The Vibrio species undergo cryptic changes in their genetic material for better
adaptability, which accounts for antibiotic resistance. In the present study, we 
investigated the emergence and spread of sensitivity to polymyxin B by V.
cholerae O1 El Tor strains from 1995 to 2019 in Odisha, India. The results
exhibited that out of 1200 V. cholerae O1 strains, 89.4% were resistant and
remaining 10.6% strains were sensitive to polymyxin B. The sensitivity to
polymyxin B by V. cholerae O1 strains emerged from 2005 to 2019 except 2015 that 
clearly signifies the presence of classical biotype characteristics possessed by 
El Tor variant V. cholerae O1 strains. The Etest assay revealed some interesting 
trait of polymyxin B susceptibility on ctxB1 and ctxB7 genotypes of V. cholerae
O1 strains. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ctxB7 genotypes showed 
reduced MIC values of ≤ 4µg/ml; whereas ctxB1 genotypes exhibited higher MIC
values of 24 and 32µg/ml.
