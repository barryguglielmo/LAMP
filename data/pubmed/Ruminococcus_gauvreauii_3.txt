Alteration of gut microbiome composition has been linked to cardiovascular
diseases. To identify specific bacterial communities associated with coronary
artery diseases (CAD), we conducted a case-control study with 53 advanced CAD
patients and 53 age-, sex-, race-, and BMI-matched controls. V3-V5 regions of the
16S rDNA from the fecal gut material were analyzed to compare the gut microbiome 
composition between CAD patients and controls. The alpha diversity, including
Chao-1, Shannon-index, and the number of observed taxonomy units were
significantly decreased in CAD patients indicating, decreased richness and
evenness of gut microbiome. Among 23 different abundant taxa at the genus level, 
12 taxa belonged to Lachnospiraceae family, which are known to produce butyrate. 
Further, we identified five taxa which showed more than two log-fold changes with
maximum proportion >0.002, including Ruminococcus gnavus, Lachnospiraceae
anaerosporobacter, Lachnospiraceae NK4B4 group, Lachnospiraceae UCG-004, and
Ruminococcus gauvreauii. After adjustment for coronary risk factors (diabetes
mellitus and dyslipidemia), decreased relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae NK4B4
group and Ruminococcus Gauvreauii and increased relative abundance of
Ruminococcus gnavus were associated with the presence of advanced CAD. The
observed differences in taxa between CAD patients and controls in this study may 
provide insight into the link between the gut microbiome and CAD.
