BACKGROUND: The popularity of fermented foods such as kefir, kuniss, and tofu has
been greatly increasing over the past several decades, and the ability of
probiotic bacteria to exert anticancer effects has recently become the focus of
research. While we have recently demonstrated the ability of the novel kefir
product PFT (Probiotics Fermentation Technology) to exert anticancer effects in
vitro, here we demonstrate its ability to inhibit Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC)
in mice.
METHODS: Mice were inoculated intramuscularly with EAC cells to develop solid
tumors. PFT was administered orally (2 g/kg/day) to mice 6 days/week, either 2
days before tumor cell inoculation or 9 days after inoculation to mice bearing
solid tumors. Tumor growth, blood lymphocyte levels, cell cycle progression,
apoptosis, apoptotic regulator expression, TNF-α expression, changes in
mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), PCNA, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in tumor 
cells were quantitatively evaluated by flow cytometry or RT-PCR. Further studies 
in vitro were carried out where EAC cells along with several other human cancer
cell lines were cultured in the presence of PFT (0-5 mg/mL). Percent cell
viability and IC50 was estimated by MTT assay.
RESULTS: Our data shows that PFT exerts the following: 1) inhibition of tumor
incidence and tumor growth; 2) inhibition of cellular proliferation via a marked 
decrease in the expression of tumor marker PCNA; 3) arrest of the tumor cell
cycle in the sub-G0/G1 phase, signifying apoptosis; 4) induction of apoptosis in 
cancer cells via a mitochondrial-dependent pathway as indicated by the
up-regulation of p53 expression, increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, decrease in the
polarization of MMP, and caspase-3 activation; and 5) immunomodulation with an
increase in the number of infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and an enhancement
of TNF-α expression within the tumor.
CONCLUSIONS: PFT reduces tumor incidence and tumor growth in mice with EAC by
inducing apoptosis in EAC cells via the mitochondrial-dependent pathway,
suppressing cancer cell proliferation, and stimulating the immune system. PFT may
be a useful agent for cancer prevention.
