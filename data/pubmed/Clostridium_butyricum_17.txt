At present, the traditional methods for the screening of Clostridium butyricum
are not sufficiently selective and efficient. Therefore, it is necessary to
establish a targeted and efficient screening method for the detection of C.
butyricum. Bioinformatics was used in this study to find C. butyricum specific
genes, and species-specific primers were designed based on the conserved regions 
of the targeted genes, followed by optimization of the PCR conditions.
Methodological evaluation was carried out, and the results were compared with the
traditional screening method based on Trypticase Sulfite Neomycin (TSN) selective
medium. A high-efficiency PCR screening method, targeting C. butyricum
species-specific primers, was established. The method was confirmed to have high 
specificity and sensitivity towards C. butyricum cut-off CFU 103. Compared with
the traditional method, the screening success rate of C. butyricum strains
increased from 0.61 to 81.91%. The PCR screening method could quickly and
accurately detect C. butyricum in samples and dramatically improve screening
efficiency.
