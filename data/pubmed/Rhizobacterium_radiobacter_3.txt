Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are components of immune defense in many organisms,
including plants. They combat pathogens due to their antiviral, antifungal and
antibacterial properties, and are considered potential therapeutic agents. An
example of AMP is Epsilon-Poly-L-lysine (EPL), a polypeptide formed by ~ 25
lysine residues with known antimicrobial activity against several human microbial
pathogens. EPL presents some advantages such as good water solubility, thermal
stability, biodegradability, and low toxicity, being a candidate for the control 
of phytopathogens. Our aim was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of EPL
against four phytobacterial species spanning different classes within the
Gram-negative phylum Proteobacteria: Agrobacterium tumefaciens (syn. Rhizobium
radiobacter), Ralstonia solanacearum, Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (X. citri), 
and Xanthomonas euvesicatoria. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the 
peptide ranged from 80 μg/ml for X. citri to 600 μg/ml for R. solanacearum and X.
euvesicatoria. Two hours of MIC exposure led to pathogen death due to cell lysis 
and was enough for pathogen clearance. The protective and curative effects of EPL
were demonstrated on tomato plants inoculated with X. euvesicatoria. Plants
showed less disease severity when sprayed with EPL solution, making it a
promising natural product for the control of plant diseases caused by diverse
Proteobacteria.
