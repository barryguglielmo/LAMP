Xylanosomes, also known as hemicellulosomes, are hemicellulose-degrading
nano-scale multienzyme complexes produced by some Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and
Fungi. Here we report the isolation of the MECs produced by Actinotalea fermentas
JCM9966, as well as the functional studies and subunit structure revealed by
proteomic identifications. The isolated MECs here shows similar particle size
with the xylanosomes produced by C. cellulans F16, have several conserved
multi-domain proteins, while differ significantly in enzymatic activities and low
molecular weight subunit compositions, indicating diverse capability as well as
bias in degrading hemicelluloses.
