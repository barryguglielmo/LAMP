Enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of echothiophate, a P-S bonded organophosphorus (OP) 
model, was spectrofluorimetrically monitored, using Calbiochem Probe IV as the
thiol reagent. OP hydrolases were: the G117H mutant of human
butyrylcholinesterase capable of hydrolyzing OPs, and a multiple mutant of
Brevundimonas diminuta phosphotriesterase, GG1, designed to hydrolyze a large
spectrum of OPs at high rate, including V agents. Molecular modeling of
interaction between Probe IV and OP hydrolases (G117H butyrylcholinesterase, GG1,
wild types of Brevundimonas diminuta and Sulfolobus solfataricus
phosphotriesterases, and human paraoxonase-1) was performed. The high sensitivity
of the method allowed steady-state kinetic analysis of echothiophate hydrolysis
by highly purified G117H butyrylcholinesterase concentration as low as 0.85 nM.
Hydrolysis was michaelian with Km = 0.20 ± 0.03 mM and kcat = 5.4 ± 1.6 min-1.
The GG1 phosphotriesterase hydrolyzed echothiophate with a high efficiency (Km = 
2.6 ± 0.2 mM; kcat = 53400 min-1). With a kcat/Km = (2.6 ± 1.6) × 107 M-1min-1,
GG1 fulfills the required condition of potential catalytic bioscavengers. quantum
mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) and molecular docking indicate that Probe
IV does not interact significantly with the selected phosphotriesterases.
Moreover, results on G117H mutant show that Probe IV does not inhibit
butyrylcholinesterase. Therefore, Probe IV can be recommended for monitoring
hydrolysis of P-S bonded OPs by thiol-free OP hydrolases.
