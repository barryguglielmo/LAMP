A novel facultative anaerobic, Gram-stain-positive coccus, strain JS71T, was
isolated from the human subgingival dental plaque of a periodontitis lesion.
Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (16S rDNA) revealed
that the strain belonged to the genus Streptococcus. The 16S rDNA sequence had
high similarity with Streptococcus rubneri DSM 26920T (98.6%), Streptococcus
parasanguinis ATCC 15912T (98.5%), and Streptococcus australis CCUG 45919T
(98.3%). The genome of strain JS71T was 2,009,592 bp in length. The DNA G+C
content of the strain was 42.1 mol%. Average nucleotide identity values between
strain JS71T and S. rubneri DSM 26920T, S. parasanguinis ATCC 15912T, and S.
australis CCUG 45919T were 88.9%, 80.8%, and 92.4%, respectively.
Genome-to-genome distance values between strain JS71TS. rubneri DSM 26920T, S.
parasanguinis ATCC 15912T, and S. australis CCUG 45919T were 36.5% (34-39%),
26.3% (23.9-28.7%), and 48.0% (45.4-50.6%), respectively. The major fatty acids
of the strain were C16:0 (39.7%), C18:1 ω6c/C18:1 ω7c (15.5%), and C18:0 (10.4%).
Based on these results, strain JS71T (= KCOM 2890T = JCM 33454T) should be a
novel species of the genus Streptococcus, for which the name Streptococcus
koreensis sp. nov. is proposed.
