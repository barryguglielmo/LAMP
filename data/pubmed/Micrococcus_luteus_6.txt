Methanogenic microbial communities were enriched from rice paddy soil and
anaerobic digester sludge using peptidoglycan purified from gram-negative
Escherichia coli or gram-positive Micrococcus luteus as the sole substrate.
Methane production data suggested the anaerobic degradation of peptidoglycan and 
also that peptidoglycan from E. coli had lower degradability. The community
structures of enrichment cultures fed peptidoglycan from E. coli or M. luteus
were similar, but distinctly different. A number of phylogenetically novel and
uncultured bacteria, particularly in the phyla Bacteroidetes, WWE1,
Armatimonadetes, and Verrucomicrobia, dominated the enrichment cultures,
suggesting their involvement in anaerobic peptidoglycan degradation.
