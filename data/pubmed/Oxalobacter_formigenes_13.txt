BACKGROUND: Oxalobacter formigenes are bacteria that colonize the human gut and
degrade oxalate, a component of most kidney stones. Findings of clinical and
epidemiological studies suggest that O. formigenes colonization reduces the risk 
for kidney stones. We sought to develop murine models to allow investigating O.
formigenes in the context of its native human microbiome.
METHODS: For humanization, we transplanted pooled feces from healthy,
noncolonized human donors supplemented with a human O. formigenes strain into
recipient mice. We transplanted microbiota into mice that were treated with
broad-spectrum antibiotics to suppress their native microbiome, were germ free,
or received humanization without pretreatment or received sham gavage (controls).
RESULTS: All humanized mice were stably colonized with O. formigenes through 8
weeks after gavage, whereas mice receiving sham gavage remained uncolonized (P < 
.001). Humanization significantly changed the murine intestinal microbial
community structure (P < .001), with humanized germ-free and antibiotic-treated
groups overlapping in β-diversity. Both germ-free and antibiotic-treated mice had
significantly increased numbers of human species compared with sham-gavaged mice 
(P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Transplanting mice with human feces and O. formigenes introduced new
microbial populations resembling the human microbiome, with stable O. formigenes 
colonization; such models can define optimal O. formigenes strains to facilitate 
clinical trials.
