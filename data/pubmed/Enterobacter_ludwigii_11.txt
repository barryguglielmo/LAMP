Microorganisms are used to alleviate heavy metal stress in plants cultivated in
contaminated fields. However, the relevant mechanisms have been rarely explored. 
The goal of this study was to investigate effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal
fungus Funneliformis mosseae and two Cd-resistant bacterial strains (Enterobacter
sp. EG16 and Enterobacter ludwigii DJ3) on growth and Cd tolerance of tomato when
applied with different inoculation strategies (single or dual) and Cd
concentrations (50 and 100â€‰mg kg-1). Better plant growth was observed in
mycorrhizal alone or combined treatments. In F. mosseae and EG16 co-inoculation
treatment, shoot and root dry weight were 119-154% and 91-173% higher than those 
of the control, respectively. Higher bacterial and mycorrhizal colonization rate 
and root Cd concentration were also found in this treatment. However, the
decrease of shoot Cd concentration and translocation factor values indicated this
treatment was effective in improving Cd tolerance of the host plants. In
addition, the increase in soil pH and decline in bioavailable Cd in the
rhizosphere might be partly involved in reduction of Cd accumulation in plants.
Our results suggest that co-inoculation with suitable microorganisms is important
in plant growth and tolerance to Cd in Cd-contaminated soil.
