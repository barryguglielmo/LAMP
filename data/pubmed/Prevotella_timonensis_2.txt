Vaginal microbiota dysbiosis and bacterial vaginosis (BV) affect negatively
women's health. Understanding vaginal microbiota fluctuations in BV during and
after antibiotic treatment would facilitate accurate decision-making on the
treatment regimen, avoid unnecessary antibiotic use, and potentially mitigate
recurrence. We investigated vaginal microbiota composition of 30 women with BV
before and after 5-day metronidazole treatment and compared the results with 30
healthy women. Vaginal microbiota was assessed by Nugent score and analyzed by
16S rRNA gene sequencing in swabs on baseline Day 1, and on Day 8 and 15, after
completion of antibiotic treatment by women with BV. Prior to antibiotic
treatment (Day 1), BV-positive women were dominated by Lactobacillus iners
(25.8%), Prevotella timonensis/bivia (18.0%), and Gardnerella vaginalis (14.6%), 
whereas healthy women were dominated by L. iners (37.5%) and Lactobacillus
crispatus/acidophilus (19.2%). On Day 8, L. iners abundance increased in
BV-treated women being significantly higher compared with healthy women (67.8%
vs. 37.5%, p = 0.049). On Day 15, the relative abundance of all microbial taxa
was similar between the groups. Vaginal microbiota of women with BV shifted to
resemble that of healthy controls after metronidazole. Sequencing analysis
provides more in-depth understanding of changes in vaginal microbiota. The role
of L. iners in vaginal health and dysbiosis requires further investigations.
