The aim of this study was to identify the pathogens potentially involved in
parietal fibrinous peritonitis (PFP). PFP is a complication of laparotomy in
cattle, characterized by an accumulation of exudate inside a fibrinous capsule.
We have studied 72 cases of PFP in Belgian blue cows, confirmed by a standard
diagnostic protocol. Blood was collected to evaluate the presence of antibodies
for Mycoplasma bovis(M. bovis), Coxiella burnetii(C. burnetii) and Bovine
Herpesvirus 4(BoHV4) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Peritoneal exudate
was obtained from the PFP cavity to perform bacteriological culture, and to
identify the DNA of M. bovis, C. burnetii and BoHV4 using real time polymerase
chain reaction (qPCR). Bacteriological culture was positive in most peritoneal
samples (59/72); Trueperella pyogenes (T. pyogenes) (51/72) and Escherichia coli 
(E. coli) (20/72) were the most frequently identified. For BoHV4, the majority of
cows showed positive serology and qPCR (56/72 and 49/72, respectively).
Contrariwise, M. bovis (17/72 and 6/72, respectively) and C. burnetii (15/72 and 
6/72, respectively) were less frequently detected (p < 0.0001). Our study proves 
that PFP can no longer be qualified as a sterile inflammation. Moreover, we
herein describe the first identification of BoHV4 and C. burnetii in cows
affected by PFP.
