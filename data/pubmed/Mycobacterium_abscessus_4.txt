Mycobacterium abscessus is a prevalent pathogenic mycobacterium in cystic
fibrosis (CF) patients and one of the most highly drug resistant mycobacterial
species to antimicrobial agents. It possesses the property to transition from a
smooth (S) to a rough (R) morphotype, thereby influencing the host innate immune 
response. This transition from the S to the R morphotype takes place in patients 
with an exacerbation of the disease and a persistence of M. abscessus. We have
previously shown that the exacerbation of the Toll-like receptor 2
(TLR2)-mediated inflammatory response, following this S to R transition, is
essentially due to overproduction of bacilli cell envelope surface compounds,
which we were able to extract by mechanical treatment and isolation by solvent
partition in a fraction called interphase. Here, we set up a purification
procedure guided by bioactivity to isolate a fraction from the R variant of M.
abscessus cells which exhibits a high TLR2 stimulating activity, referred to as
TLR2-enriched fraction (TLR2eF). As expected, TLR2eF was found to contain several
lipoproteins and proteins known to be stimuli for TLR2. Vaccination with TLR2eF
showed no protection toward an M. abscessus aerosol challenge, but provided mild 
protection in ΔF508 mice and their FVB littermates when intravenously challenged 
by M. abscessus. Interestingly however, antibodies against TLR2eF compounds were 
detected during disease in CF patients. In conclusion, we show the potential for 
compounds in TLR2eF as vaccine and diagnostic candidates, in order to enhance
diagnosis, prevent and/or treat M. abscessus-related infections.
