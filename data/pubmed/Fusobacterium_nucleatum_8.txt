Introduction: Mucinous adenocarcinoma of the rectum is an infrequently
encountered histological subtype that is associated with an impaired response to 
chemoradiotherapy and a worse overall prognosis. A genomic profile analysis of
mucinous rectal tumors has not yet been performed. The aim of this study was to
comprehensively describe the burden of somatic mutations and copy number
variation as well as perform mutational signature and microbial analysis of an
in-house collected cohort of mucinous adenocarcinoma of the rectum.
Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted from 10 cases of mucinous rectal cancer and
matched normal tissue. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was carried out on these 10 
cases and a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis was undertaken.
Results: The average number of SNVs, InDels and SVs in the cohort was 16,600,
1,855, and 120, respectively. A single case was MSI-H. KRAS mutations were found 
in 70% of cases while TP53 was mutated in only 40% of cases. CNA gain was
identified on chromosomes 7, 8, 12, 13, and 20 while CNA loss was found on
chromosomes 4, 8, 17, and 18 corresponding to oncogenes and tumor suppressor
genes, respectively. Overall mucinous rectal cancers are more likely to be MSI-H 
and to have KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations when compared to rectal
adenocarcinoma NOS. Microbial analysis demonstrated an abundance of Fusobacterium
nucleatum in tumor samples compared to normal tissue.
Conclusion: This study provides a detailed WGS analysis of 10 cases of mucinous
rectal cancer. It demonstrates an important lesson in tumor biology in that
histologically similar tumors can have extensive differences at the genomic
level. This study is relevant as it raises important questions about the
relationship between bacteria and malignancy.
