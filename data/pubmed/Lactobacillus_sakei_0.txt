Several studies suggest that probiotics might be useful in the management of
atopic dermatitis (AD). However, the efficacy and comparison between both the
administration of viable and non-viable probiotics on alleviation of AD is not
well studied. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of 
L. sakei proBio65 live and dead cells when administered (1 × 1010 cells/day) for 
12 weeks to children and adolescents (aged 3 to 18) with atopic dermatitis. In
this randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study, ninety patients were
recruited and randomly allocated to either the L. sakei proBio65 live cells, L.
sakei proBio65 dead cells, or placebo groups. Assessment of efficacy was based on
the change in SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) score, Investigators Global
Assessment (IGA) score, serum inflammatory markers such as the serum eosinophil
(count), IgE, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), CCL17 (thymus and
activation-regulated chemokine [TARC]), and CCL27 (cutaneous T cell-attracting
chemokine [CTACK]), and changes in skin condition (moisture and sebum) at
baseline, week 6 and week 12. The SCORAD total score decreased in the live cells 
(p = 0.0015) and dead cell group (p = 0.0017) from the baseline after 12 weeks,
whereas there were no significant changes in the placebo group when compared with
baseline. The skin sebum content increased in both the live cell (p < 0.0001) and
the dead cell group (p < 0.0001), suggesting potential improvements in skin
barrier functions. Current data suggested a positive improvement in alleviation
of AD symptoms upon oral administration of L. sakei proBio65 in both viable and
non-viable forms.
