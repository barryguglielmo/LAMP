Biocide susceptibility testing (BST) of bacteria lacks standardised methods.
Based on a recently established broth macrodilution BST method, a broth
microdilution method for BST was developed. To establish the respective protocol,
four reference strains Staphylococcus aureus ATCC® 6538, Enterococcus hirae ATCC®
10541, Escherichia coli ATCC® 10536 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC® 15442 were
investigated for their minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) towards
quaternary ammonium compounds (benzalkonium chloride), cationic compounds
(chlorhexidine), aldehydes (glutardialdehyde) and alcohols (isopropanol) using
tryptic soy broth. All combinations of (i) inoculum preparation according to the 
German Veterinary Medical Society (DVG) or the Clinical and Laboratory Standards 
Institute (CLSI) with some modifications, (ii) use of 1st subculture (SC) and 2nd
SC, (iii) direct colony suspension (DCS) with/without glass beads, and (iv)
incubation at 37 °C for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h were compared using seven
independent replications. Overall, the reproducibility was high for all
abovementioned strain/biocide/parameter combinations. In total, 86.9 % - 100 % of
the results were within ± one dilution step of the mode value. The proposed
method for a standardised BST protocol comprises (i) two different inoculum
densities, (ii) the use of a fresh overnight culture (1st SC or 2nd SC), (iii)
the preparation of the inoculum suspension by either of the two methods using DCS
with or without glass beads, and (iv) the incubation at 37 °C for 24 h. This
broth microdilution method will help to harmonize BST of bacterial pathogens in
routine diagnostics.
