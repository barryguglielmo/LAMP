PURPOSE: This in vitro study was designed to compare bacterial adhesion to
zirconia versus lithium disilicate crowns after artificial aging.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-five discs were tested in this study: 25 Cr-Co
base metal discs (control), 25 zirconia discs, and 25 lithium disilicate discs.
Each sample was polished and glazed appropriately. The discs were subjected to
1000 thermal cycles between 5 and 55°C, whereby samples stayed in the bath for 20
seconds, at each temperature. Then, 10 μl of Streptococcus sanguinis suspension
was placed on the discs. The samples were scanned for surface roughness before
and after aging, and after incubation. Sp and Sa were measured with a confocal,
visible light disk-scanning system (Sa expresses the difference in height of each
point compared to the arithmetical mean of the surface. Sp is the height of the
highest peak within the defined area). Optical density of the discs was evaluated
by a spectrophotometer. One-way ANOVA was performed to assess differences after
aging and incubation.
RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed significant differences (p = 0.02) in
surface roughness between the Cr-Co base metal, zirconia and lithium disilicate
before and after aging. The mean Sa was 0.36 ± 0.12 μm, 0.638 ± 0.24 μm, and 1.23
± 0.42 μm respectively. Lithium disilicate had the highest surface roughness
values. There was a significant difference (p = 0.001) after incubation. The mean
and standard deviation surface roughness of Cr-Co base metal, zirconia and
lithium disilicate were 0.99 ± 0.49 μm, 1.40 ± 0.46 μm, 2.44 ± 1.21 μm
respectively. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved While
no significant differences were found in the accumulation of S. Sanguinis between
zirconia and lithium disilicate, there was a significant difference (p = 0.02) in
the optical density between these 2 test groups and the control group (metal).
The optical density of metal (0.94 ± 0.15) was higher than for lithium disilicate
(0.74 ± 0.10) and zirconia (0.75 ± 0.08). There was no statistical difference in 
bacterial adherence between lithium disilicate and zirconia.
CONCLUSION: Dental crown materials differed significantly in terms of surface
roughness and bacterial adhesion between Cr-Co base metal and zirconia and
lithium disilicate. After aging and bacterial adherence, the zirconia discs had
the smoothest surface, with similar bacterial accumulation as lithium disilicate;
suggesting that lithium disilicate may be less sensitive to bacterial adhesion
than zirconia.
