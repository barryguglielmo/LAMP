Recent studies suggest that birth mode (Cesarean section [C-section] or vaginal
delivery) is an important event in the initial colonization of the human
microbiome and may be associated with long-term health outcomes. We sought to
determine the association between a woman's birth mode and her vaginal microbiota
in adulthood. We re-contacted 144 adult women from two U.S. studies and
administered a brief survey. Vaginal microbiota was characterized on a single
sample by amplicon sequencing of the V3-V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA 
gene and clustered into community state types (CSTs). We evaluated the
association between birth mode and a CST with low relative abundance of
Lactobacillus spp. ("molecular bacterial vaginosis" [Molecular-BV]) compared to
Lactobacillus-dominated CSTs in logistic regression modeling which adjusted for
body mass index, a confounder in this analysis. Twenty-seven women (19%) reported
C-section. Overall, C-section showed a non-significant trend towards increased
odds of Molecular-BV (aOR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.45, 3.32), and Prevotella bivia was
the strongest single taxa associated with C-section. However, because the two
archived studies had different inclusion criteria (interaction p = 0.048), we
stratified the analysis by study site. In the study with a larger sample size (n 
= 88), women born by C-section had 3-fold higher odds of Molecular-BV compared to
vaginally-delivered women (aOR = 3.55, p = 0.06, 95% CI: 0.97-13.02). No
association was found in the smaller study (n = 56, aOR = 0.19, p = 0.14, 95% CI:
0.02-1.71). This pilot cross-sectional study suggests a possible association
between C-section and Molecular-BV in adulthood. However, the analysis is limited
by small sample size and lack of comparability in participant age and other
characteristics between the study sites. Future longitudinal studies could
recruit larger samples of women, address the temporal dynamics of vaginal
microbiota, and explore other confounders, including maternal factors,
breastfeeding history, and socioeconomic status, which may affect the
relationship between birth mode and vaginal microbiota.
