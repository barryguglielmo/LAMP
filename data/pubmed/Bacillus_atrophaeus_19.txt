Synthesis of (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES)-functionalized graphene
oxide (GO) nanosheets, statistical optimization of conditions for immobilization 
of Bacillus atrophaeus lipase (BaL) on as-synthesized support, and application of
the immobilized BaL for esterification of valeric acid were carried out in this
investigation. The optimum specific activity of the immobilized BaL
(81.60 ± 0.28 U mg-1) was achieved at 3 mg mL-1 of GO-NH2, 50 mM of phosphate
buffer, pH 7.0, 60 min sonication time, 100 mM glutaraldehyde, 25 U mL-1 of
enzyme, and 8 h immobilization time at 4 °C. The immobilized BaL retained about
90% of its initial activity after 10 days of storage. Moreover, about 70% of the 
initial activity of the immobilized BaL was retained after 10 cycles of
application. The results of esterification studies exhibited that maximum pentyl 
valerate synthesis using the free BaL (34.5%) and the immobilized BaL (92.7%)
occurred in the organic solvent medium (xylene) after 48 h of incubation at
60 °C.
