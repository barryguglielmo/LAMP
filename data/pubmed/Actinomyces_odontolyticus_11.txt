OBJECTIVES: The influence of commercial helium-oxygen saturation diving on
divers' gut microbiotas was assessed to provide dietary suggestion.
METHODS: Faecal samples of 47 divers working offshore were collected before (T1),
during (T2) and after (T3) saturation diving. Their living and excursion depths
were 55-134 metres underwater with a saturation duration of 12-31 days and PaO2
of 38-65 kPa. The faecal samples were examined through 16S ribosomal DNA amplicon
sequencing based on the Illumina sequencing platform to analyse changes in the
bacteria composition in the divers' guts.
RESULTS: Although the α and β diversity of the gut microbiota did not change
significantly, we found that living in a hyperbaric environment of helium-oxygen 
saturation decreased the abundance of the genus Bifidobacterium, an obligate
anaerobe, from 2.43%±3.83% at T1 to 0.79%±1.23% at T2 and 0.59%±0.79% at T3.
Additionally, the abundance of some short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing
bacteria, such as Fusicatenibacter, Faecalibacterium, rectale group and
Anaerostipes, showed a decreased trend in the order of before, during and after
diving. On the contrary, the abundance of species, such as Lactococcus garvieae, 
Actinomyces odontolyticus, Peptoclostridium difficile, Butyricimonas virosa,
Streptococcus mutans, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica and A. graevenitzii, showed
an increasing trend, but most of them were pathogens.
CONCLUSIONS: Occupational exposure to high pressure in a helium-oxygen saturation
environment decreased the abundance of Bifidobacterium and some SCFA-producing
bacteria, and increased the risk of pathogenic bacterial infection.
Supplementation of the diver diet with probiotics or prebiotics during saturation
diving might prevent these undesirable changes.
