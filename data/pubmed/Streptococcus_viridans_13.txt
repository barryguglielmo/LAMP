Viridans group streptococci (VGS), especially the Streptococcus mitis-oralis
subgroup, are pivotal pathogens in a variety of invasive endovascular infections,
including "toxic shock" in neutropenic cancer patients and infective endocarditis
(IE). Previously, we showed that the serial in vitro passage of S. mitis-oralis
strains in sublethal daptomycin (DAP) resulted in rapid, high-level and stable
DAP-resistance (DAP-R), which is accompanied by distinct changes in several
genotypic and phenotypic signatures: (1) the disappearance of two key membrane
phospholipids, phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL); (2) increased
membrane fluidity; (3) increased positive surface charge; (4) single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in two loci involved in CL biosynthesis (pgsA; cdsA); and
(5) DAP hyperaccumulation. The current study examined these same metrics
following in vitro serial DAP passages of a separate well-characterized S.
mitis-oralis bloodstream isolate (SF100). Although some metrics seen in prior DAP
post-passage strains were recapitulated with SF100 (e.g., pgsA SNPs, enhanced
membrane fluidity), we observed the following major differences (comparing the
parental versus post-passage variant): (1) no change in PG content; (2) reduced, 
but not absent, CL, with enhancement in phosphatidic acid (PA) content; (3) an
unusual pattern of CL localization; (4) significantly decreased positive surface 
charge; (5) no difference in DAP accumulation; and (6) no cdsA SNPs. Thus, S.
mitis-oralis strains are not "pre-programmed" phenotypically and/or genotypically
to adapt in an identical manner during the evolution of the DAP-R.
