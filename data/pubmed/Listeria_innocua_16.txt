Mediterranean herbs, specially thyme and rosemary, are important ingredients in
food preparation and more recently have been studied as natural sources of
bioactive compounds. This study aimed to study the effect of matrix (thyme vs.
rosemary), and extraction protocol (conventional extraction vs. ultrasound
assisted extraction) solvent composition (water vs. 50:50 ethanol:water solution)
on the extraction of high value compounds (phenolic compounds, flavonoids and
carotenoids) and also explore the antioxidant, antimicrobial (Listeria innocua,
Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella enterica), probiotic (Lactobacillus casei
and Bifidobacterium lactis), and anti-inflammatory activities. The phenolic,
flavonoid and carotenoid content of extracts was greatly influenced by extraction
conditions wherein the ultrasound pre-treatment improved the extraction of
carotenoids but induced the opposite effect for polyphenols and flavonoids in
both herbs. Only the aqueous extract of thyme obtained from ultrasound
pre-treatment was the only extract that inhibited the growth of potentially
pathogenic bacteria, stimulated the probiotic bacteria and achieved high
anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity. Moreover, this extract also was rich 
on phenolic compounds (such as p-coumaric acid 4-O-glucoside, kaempferol
3-O-rutinoside, feruloyl glucose, and 4-vinylguaiacol) and carotenoids.
Therefore, ultrasound extraction of bioactive compounds with water as solvent
could be explored in food and pharmaceutical applications.
