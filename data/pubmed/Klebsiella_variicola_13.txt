ABSTRACT: Histamine poisoning occurs when fish containing high amount of
histamine are consumed. Because histamine is thermally stable, control of
histamine-forming bacteria in seafood is an appropriate strategy for preventing
the formation of histamine. One prevention method is the use of gamma irradiation
on the histamine formers. To understand the effect of gamma irradiation on the
histamine-forming bacteria, laboratory isolates of the prolific histamine formers
Morganella morganii, Klebsiella variicola, and Proteus vulgaris were exposed to
various doses of gamma radiation in nutrient broth and tuna muscle spiked with
histamine formers. None of the test bacteria survived in tuna muscle irradiated
at 2.0 kGy. K. variicola was highly sensitive to gamma irradiation and was
eliminated at a dose of 1.5 kGy. Histamine production also was reduced
significantly as the radiation dose increased. These results suggest that gamma
irradiation can effectively eliminate histamine-forming bacteria and reduce the
threat of histamine poisoning from seafood.
