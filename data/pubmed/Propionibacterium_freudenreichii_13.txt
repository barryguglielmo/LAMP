The article presents a proteomic data set generated by a comparative analysis of 
the proteomes of Propionibacterium freudenreichii, comparing the CIRM-BIA 129 and
CIRM-BIA 1025 strains. The two strains were cultivated until the beginning of the
stationary phase in a chemical defined medium (MMO), and in this medium in the
presence of NaCl, with or without glycine betaine. Whole-cell proteins were
extracted, trypsinolyzed and analyzed by nano LC-MS/MS, prior to identification
and classification by function using the X!Tandem pipeline software and the
proteomic data from NCBI.nlm.nigh.gov. Quantification of proteins was then
carried out in order to detect change in their expression depending on the
culture medium. This article is related to the research article entitled
"Benefits and drawbacks of osmotic adjustment in Propionibacterium
freudenreichii". The comparative proteomic analysis of the two strains reveal
strain-dependent and medium-dependent stress proteomes in the probiotic P.
freudenreichii.
