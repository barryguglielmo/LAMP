Bacillus megaterium strain O1 was isolated from a soapnut (Sapindus saponaria)
surface and degrades Quillaja saponin as a sole carbon source. We report the
draft genome sequence of B. megaterium O1, which has an estimated size of 5.1 Mb.
Study of this isolate will provide insight into mechanisms of saponin
degradation.
