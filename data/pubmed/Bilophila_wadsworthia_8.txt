BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence infer that gut microbiome-host relations are
key mediators or modulators driving the observed sexual dimorphism in some
disease onset and progression. To date, the sex-differences of gut microbiota at 
different pubertal status have not been reported.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the characteristics of gut microbiota of both genders at 
different pubertal status.
METHODS: Gut microbiota was analyzed in 89 Chinese participants aged 5-15 years. 
Participants were divided into pre-puberty and puberty groups for both male and
female. The composition of gut microbiota was investigated by 16S rRNA-based
metagenomics. Ecological representations of microbial communities were computed. 
The prediction of metagenomic functional content from 16S rRNA gene surveys was
conducted.
RESULTS: There were 49 males (9.76 ± 2.15 years) and 40 females
(9.74 ± 1.63 years); 21 males and 26 females were at puberty. At genus level,
Alistipes, Megamonas, Oscillospira and Parabacteroides were more prevalent in
girls than in boys (p < 0.05). There were no significantly differences of
alpha-diversity between genders, which was independent of pubertal status. The
beta-diversity was significantly different in pubertal subjects between genders. 
Using statistical analyses, we assigned genera Dorea, Megamonas, Bilophila,
Parabacteroides and Phascolarctobacterium as microbial markers for pubertal
subjects. The predicted metabolic profiles differ in both pubertal and
pre-pubertal groups between genders.
CONCLUSION: This cross-sectional study revealed that sex differences in the gut
microbiota composition and predicted metabolic profiles exist before puberty,
which become more significant at puberty. The identification of novel puberty
bacterial markers may disclose a potential effects of gender-related microbiota
profiles on puberty onset.
