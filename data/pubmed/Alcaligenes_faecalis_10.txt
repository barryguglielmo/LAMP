We studied the effect of acrylamide on the content of intracellular ATP in the
cells of bacteria of the genera Rhodococcus and Alcaligenes, the luminescence of 
the genetically engineered strain Escherichia coli K12 TG1 (pXen7), and the
survival of bacteria of various systematic groups. According to the level of
decrease in the concentration of intracellular ATP, it was found that the strain 
with lower amidase activity (R. erythropolis 6-21) and Gram-negative
proteobacteria A. faecalis 2 were the most sensitive to acrylamide after a 20-min
exposure, while the strain R. ruber gt 1 was stable, having a high nitrile
hydratase activity in combination with a low amidase activity. EC50 of acrylamide
for 2 h was 7.1 g/L for E. coli K12 TG1 (pXen7). Acrylamide at a concentration of
10-20 mM added to the culture medium led to a slight decrease in the number of
CFUs of Rhodococcus, A. faecalis 2, and E. coli compared to the control. At an
acrylamide concentration of 250 mM, from 0.016 to 0.116% of viable bacterial
cells remained, and a solution of 500 mM and higher inhibited the growth of the
majority of the studied strains. The results confirm that acrylamide is much less
toxic to prokaryotes than to eukaryotes.
