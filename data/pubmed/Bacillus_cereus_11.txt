Glycine oxidase (GO) is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of the primary and
secondary amines of various chemicals, including glycine, and the enzyme has been
applied in a variety of fields, such as biosensor and genetically modified
glyphosate resistance plants. Here, we report that the gene product of BC0747
from Bacillus cereus (BcGO) shows oxidase activity for glycine and small d-amino 
acids, such as d-proline and d-alanine. We also determined the crystal structure 
of BcGO complexed with the FAD cofactor at a 2.36 Å resolution and revealed how
the cofactor binds to the deep pocket of the enzyme. We performed the molecular
docking calculation of the glycine substrate to the BcGO structure and identified
how the carboxyl- and amine-groups of the d-amino acid are stabilized at the
substrate binding site. Structural analysis of BcGO also provided information on 
the structural basis for the stereospecificity of the enzyme to d-amino acids. In
addition, we placed the glyphosate molecule, a plant herbicide, at the substrate 
binding site, and explained how the mutation of Gly51 to arginine enhances enzyme
activity.
