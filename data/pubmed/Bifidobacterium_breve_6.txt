BACKGROUND: Probiotics may be neuroprotective for preterm neonates due to their
anti-inflammatory effects and ability to facilitate nutrition.
AIM: To assess long-term effects of early probiotic supplementation on
neuropsychological development in preterm infants.
STUDY DESIGN: Follow up study.
SUBJECTS: Children at age 3 to 5 years who had participated as preterm infants
(<33 week) in the randomised controlled trial.
OUTCOMES: Primary: Continuous early learning composite measure derived from the
Mullen's Scale of Early Learning (MSEL). Other outcomes were assessed by the
Developmental, Dimensional and Diagnostic Interview, Developmental
NEuroPSYchological assessment-2nd Edition, Parental questionnaires using
children's communication checklist-2nd edition, social responsiveness scale, and 
Vineland Adaptive Behavioural Scales-2nd edition.
MEASURES: Continuous scores derived from all the measures.
RESULTS: 67 children of the 159 participants (42%) (Probiotic: 36/79, Placebo:
31/80) were followed-up for at least one neuropsychological assessment. All six
assessments were completed in 18/31 (58.1%) of the control vs. 11/36 (30.6%)
probiotic group children. Multivariable analysis of MSEL composite score showed
no evidence of probiotic effect univariately, or after adjustment for gestation, 
intrauterine growth restriction, Apgar <7 at 5 min and age at assessment
(adjusted mean effect in probiotic group: -2.7, 95% CI -8.5-3.0, p = 0.349).
CONCLUSION: There was no significant effect on neurodevelopment of children
assessed at the age of 3 to 5 years who participated as preterm neonates in the
RCT of B. breve M-16V. The validity of these results is limited by the reduced
sample size due to high rate of loss to follow up.
