The IgMi mouse has normal B cell development; its B cells express an IgM B cell
receptor but cannot class switch or secrete antibody. Thus, the IgMi mouse offers
a model system by which to dissect out antibody-dependent and
antibody-independent B cell function. Here, we provide the first detailed
characterisation of the IgMi mouse post-Trichuris muris (T. muris) infection,
describing expulsion phenotype, cytokine production, gut pathology and changes in
T regulatory cells, T follicular helper cells and germinal centre B cells, in
addition to RNA sequencing (RNA seq) analyses of wild-type littermates (WT) and
mutant B cells prior to andÂ post infection. IgMi mice were susceptible to a
high-dose infection, with reduced Th2 cytokines and elevated B cell-derived IL-10
in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) compared to controls. A low-dose infection regime
revealed IgMi mice to have significantly more apoptotic cells in the gut compared
to WT mice, but no change in intestinal inflammation. IL-10 levels were again
elevated. Collectively, this study showcases the potential of the IgMi mouse as a
tool for understanding B cell biology and suggests that the B cell plays both
antibody-dependent and antibody-independent roles post high- and low-dose T.
muris infection. KEY MESSAGES: During a high-dose T. muris infection, B cells are
important in maintaining the Th1/Th2 balance in the MLN through an
antibody-independent mechanism. High levels of IL-10 in the MLN early
post-infection, and the presence of IL-10-producing B cells, correlates with
susceptibility to T. muris infection. B cells maintain gut homeostasis during
chronic T. muris infection via an antibody-dependent mechanism.
