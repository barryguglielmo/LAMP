The formation of secondary bile acids by gut microbes is a current topic of
considerable biomedical interest. However, a detailed understanding of the
biology of anaerobic bacteria in the genus Clostridium that are capable of
generating secondary bile acids is lacking. We therefore sought to determine the 
transcriptional responses of two prominent secondary bile acid producing
bacteria, Clostridium hylemonae and Clostridium hiranonis to bile salts (in
vitro) and the cecal environment of gnotobiotic mice. The genomes of C. hylemonae
DSM 15053 and C. hiranonis DSM 13275 were closed, and found to encode 3,647 genes
(3,584 protein-coding) and 2,363 predicted genes (of which 2,239 are
protein-coding), respectively, and 1,035 orthologs were shared between C.
hylemonae and C. hiranonis. RNA-Seq analysis was performed in growth medium
alone, and in the presence of cholic acid (CA) and deoxycholic acid (DCA). Growth
with CA resulted in differential expression (>0.58 log2FC; FDR < 0.05) of 197
genes in C. hiranonis and 118 genes in C. hylemonae. The bile acid-inducible
operons (bai) from each organism were highly upregulated in the presence of CA
but not DCA. We then colonized germ-free mice with human gut bacterial isolates
capable of metabolizing taurine-conjugated bile acids. This consortium included
bile salt hydrolase-expressing Bacteroides uniformis ATCC 8492, Bacteroides
vulgatus ATCC 8482, Parabacteroides distasonis DSM 20701, as well as
taurine-respiring Bilophila wadsworthia DSM 11045, and deoxycholic/lithocholic
acid generating Clostridium hylemonae DSM 15053 and Clostridium hiranonis DSM
13275. Butyrate and iso-bile acid-forming Blautia producta ATCC 27340 was also
included. The Bacteroidetes made up 84.71% of 16S rDNA cecal reads, B.
wadsworthia, constituted 14.7%, and the clostridia made up <.75% of 16S rDNA
cecal reads. Bile acid metabolomics of the cecum, serum, and liver indicate that 
the synthetic community were capable of functional bile salt deconjugation,
oxidation/isomerization, and 7α-dehydroxylation of bile acids. Cecal
metatranscriptome analysis revealed expression of genes involved in metabolism of
taurine-conjugated bile acids. The in vivo transcriptomes of C. hylemonae and C. 
hiranonis suggest fermentation of simple sugars and utilization of amino acids
glycine and proline as electron acceptors. Genes predicted to be involved in
trimethylamine (TMA) formation were also expressed.
