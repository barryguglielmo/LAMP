An understanding of the inter-species relationships, especially their metabolic
network in a mixed-culture system, is crucial to design an effective inoculum for
enhancing the power generation of wastewater fed microbial fuel cell (MFC). In
the present study, the influence of microbial mutualistic interactions on the
power generation of palm oil mill effluent fed MFCs has been widely investigated 
by designing several co-culture and mixed culture inoculums. Among the different 
inoculum compositions, the highest power density of 14.8 W/m3 was achieved by
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella variicola co-culture inoculum due to their 
synergistic relationships which were inter-linked via fermentation-based
metabolites. Besides, the interaction of K. variicola and Bacillus cereus
positively influenced the power generation resulting in a maximum power density
of 11.8 W/m3 whereas the antagonistic relationship between B. cereus and P.
aeruginosa resulted in a lower power generation of 1.9 W/m3. The microbial
mutualistic interactions were investigated with polarization, cyclic voltammetry 
(CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), as well as by using
metabolite and biofilm analysis. It was observed that the synergism between
bacteria enhanced power generation through the production of higher electron
shuttling mediators and efficient biofilm formation as evidenced by polarization,
CV and EIS analysis. In contrast, the antagonistic relationship resulted in
production of cell inhibiting metabolites leading to the formation of ineffective
biofilm. These findings demonstrate that the synergistic interaction between or
within microorganisms is emergent in designing co-culture or mixed-culture
inoculum for achieving maximum power generation in MFCs.
