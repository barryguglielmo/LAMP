Inspired with an increasing environmental awareness, we performed an eco-friendly
amenable process for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using the
catkins of Piper longum as an alternative approach with the existing methods of
using plant extracts. The fabrication of nanoparticles occurred within 10 min.
This was initially observed by colour change of the solution. UV-visible
spectroscopic studies (UV-Vis) were performed for further confirmation. The
analysis elucidated that the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was specifically
corresponding to AgNPs. Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry (FTIR)
studies indicated that polyphenols could possibly be the encapsulating agents.
The size and shape of the nanoparticles was analysed using Transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM). The nanoparticles were predominant spheres ranging between 10
and 42 nm at two different scales. The formation of elemental silver was
confirmed further by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray powder
diffraction (XRD). GC-MS analysis was used to identify the possible encapsulates 
on the nanoparticles. The antibacterial effect of the biosynthesized AgNPs was
tested against two gram-positive (Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus), and
five gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi) bacteria. Outcomes of the study
suggest that these pathogens were susceptible to the AgNPs. This is the first
ever international report on correlating the antibacterial effect of silver
nanoparticles using mathematical modelling with a conventional antimicrobial
assay. The results indicate that nanoparticles of silver synthesized using catkin
extract of P. longum can be exploited towards the development of potential
antibacterial agents.
