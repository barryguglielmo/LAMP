Background: Weaning is one of the major factors that cause stress and intestinal 
disease in piglets. Protocatechuic acid (PCA) is an active plant phenolic acid
which exists in Chinese herb, Duzhong (Eucommia ulmoides Oliver), and is also
considered as the main bioactive metabolite of polyphenol against oxidative
stress and inflammation. This study aimed to investigate the effect of PCA on
growth performance, intestinal barrier function, and gut microbiota in a weaned
piglet model challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
Methods: Thirty-six piglets (Pig Improvement Company line 337 × C48, 28 d of age,
8.87 kg ± 0.11 kg BW) were randomly allocated into 3 treatments and fed with a
basal diet (CTL), a diet added 50 mg/kg of aureomycin (AUR), or a diet
supplemented with 4000 mg/kg of PCA, respectively. The piglets were challenged
with LPS (10 μg/kg BW) on d 14 and d 21 by intraperitoneal injection during the
21-d experiment. Animals (n = 6 from each group) were sacrificed after being
anesthetized by sodium pentobarbital at 2 h after the last injection of LPS. The 
serum was collected for antioxidant indices and inflammatory cytokines analysis, 
the ileum was harvested for detecting mRNA and protein levels of tight junction
proteins by PCR and immunohistochemical staining, and the cecum chyme was
collected for intestinal flora analysis using 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
Results: Dietary supplementation of PCA or AUR significantly increased the
expression of tight junction proteins including ZO-1 and claudin-1 in intestinal 
mucosa, and decreased the serum levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances
(TBARS) and IL-6, as compared with CTL group. In addition, PCA also decreased the
serum levels of IL-2 and TNF-α (P < 0.05). Analysis of gut microbiota indicated
that PCA increased the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio (P < 0.05). Spearman's
correlation analysis at the genus level revealed that PCA reduced the relative
abundance of Prevotella 9, Prevotella 2, Holdemanella, and Ruminococcus torques
group (P < 0.05), and increased the relative abundance of Roseburia and
Desulfovibrio (P < 0.05), whereas AUR had no significant effect on these
bacteria.
Conclusions: These results demonstrated that both PCA and AUR had protective
effect on oxidative stress, inflammation and intestinal barrier function in
piglets challenged with LPS, and PCA potentially exerted the protective function 
by modulating intestinal flora in a way different from AUR.
