BACKGROUND: Klebsiella variicola and K. quasipneumoniae are new species
distinguishable from K. pneumoniae but they are often misidentified as K.
pneumoniae in clinical settings. Several reports have demonstrated the
possibility that the virulence factors and clinical features differ among these
three phylogroups. In this study, we aimed to clarify whether there were
differences in clinical and bacterial features between the three phylogroups
isolated from patients with bloodstream infections (BSIs) in Japan.
METHODS: Isolates from all patients with BSIs caused by K. pneumoniae admitted to
two hospitals between 2014 and 2017 (n = 119) were included in the study.
Bacterial species were identified via sequence analysis, and their virulence
factors and serotypes were analyzed via multiplex PCR results. Clinical data were
retrieved from medical records.
RESULTS: Of the 119 isolates, 21 (17.7%) were identified as K. variicola and 11
(9.2%) as K. quasipneumoniae; K1 serotype was found in 16 (13.4%), and K2
serotype in 13 (10.9%). Significant differences in the prevalence of rmpA, iutA, 
ybtS, entB and kfu (p < 0.001), and allS genes (p < 0.05) were found between the 
three phylogroups. However, there were no significant differences in clinical
features, including the 30-day mortality rate, between the three organisms,
although K. variicola was more frequently detected in patients over 80 years old 
compared with other Klebsiella species (p < 0.005), and K. quasipneumoniae more
frequently occurred in patients with malignancy (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated the differences in bacterial pathogenicity
and clinical features among these three phylogroups. Further epidemiological
studies into BSI caused by Klebsiella species are warranted.
