BACKGROUND: Nocardiosis is an uncommon disease caused by aerobic gram-positive
bacteria Nocardia spp. Although it is usually an opportunistic infection
affecting immunocompromised patients, even one third of cases occur in
immunocompetent persons. The aim of the study was to describe the course of
chronic meningitis due to Nocardia infection.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 52-year-old patient, chalk miner, suffered from a chronic
meningitis caused by an extremely rare pathogen. The patient's history was
complicated and diagnostic process covered multiple examinations and
consultations. Initially Kocuria rosea was cultured, yet after molecular
examination the result was verified to Nocardia farcinica. Targeted antibiotic
treatment was implemented, which resulted in gradual improvement of patients
condition. A full recovery was achieved after one year antibiotic therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: 1.Nocardia farcinica is an uncommon but possible cause of chronic
meningitis.2.In the case of a chronic meningitis of unknown origin multiple
cerebrospinal fluid cultures should be performed as the identification of
pathogen may be crucial for patient's recovery.3.In case of unusual culture, such
as Kocuria spp. PCR should be performed.
