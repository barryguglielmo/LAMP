Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are the dominant and advantageous microorganisms of
raw and fermented camel milk; these bacteria have the potential to develop
functional camel-milk-derived products and can be used in dairy technology. This 
article presents data on the diversity of LAB, isolated from raw and fermented
camel milk. In total, from two samples of raw camel milk and one sample of
fermented camel milk, seventeen isolates of LAB were isolated. The data of
genetic identification of strains, which was performed through analysis of the
16S rRNA gene sequence, is presented. According to this data, the prevailing
number of LAB belong to the Lactobacillus genus - 53%. Following species of
Lactobacillus bacteria were determined - fermentum, casei, curizae, oryzae,
brevis, plantarum, rhamnosus, paracasei. The next prevailing number of lactic
acid bacteria belong to the Pediococcus genus - 23%, represented by acidilactici 
and pentosaceus species. Lactic acid bacteria of Weissella and Enterococcus
genera comprised 12% each from total abundance. These results can be used for a
further selection of potential starter cultures for functional camel-milk-derived
products.
