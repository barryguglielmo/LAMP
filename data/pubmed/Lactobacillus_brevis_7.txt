Microbial fermentation is proven to induce molecular transformations and produce 
bioactive compounds thereby enhancing sensory and nutritional quality of
flour-based fermented foods. In this study, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were
isolated from Korean kimchi and Ethiopian fermented teff (Eragrostis tef (Zucc.) 
Trotter) flour batter. Isolates were identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing
and characterized for various probiotic properties. Few trains were selected for 
further teff flour batter fermentation and evaluating their effects on phenolic
contents and compositions. Out of 200 bacterial isolates, 44 of them showed
considerable acid and bile tolerance and 22 were tested positive for protease
activity. A large number of the isolates showed antimicrobial activities against 
Salmonella gallinarium indicator strains. Majority of these probiotic strains
belonged to Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus brevis species. All the
strains used for fermentation of teff were able to significantly increase total
phenolic contents (TPC). An increase in TPC of up to 7-fold was observed in some 
strains.
