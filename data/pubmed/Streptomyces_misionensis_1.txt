Streptomyces is the most frequently described genus of Actinomycetes, a producer 
of biologically active secondary metabolites. Indeed, the Streptomyces species
produces about 70% of antibiotics and 60% of antifungal molecules used in
agriculture. Our study was carried out with the goal of isolating and identifying
antimicrobial secondary metabolites from Streptomyces misionensisV16R3Y1 isolated
from the date palm rhizosphere (southern Tunisia). This strain presented a broad 
range of antifungal activity against Fusarium oxysporum, Aspergillus flavus,
Penicillium expansum, Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, Candida metapsilosis, 
and Candida parapsilosis and antibacterial activity against human pathogenic
bacteria, including Escherichia fergusonii, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella
enterica, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The 
purification procedure entailed ethyl acetate extract, silica gel column, and
thin layer chromatography. Based on 1H NMR metabolomic procedure application,
also supported by the GC-MS analysis, cyclic dipeptide (l-Leucyl-l-Proline) was
identified as the major compound in the bioactive fraction. In order to confirm
the identity of the active compound and to have a large quantity thereof, a
chemical synthesis of the cyclic dipeptide was performed. The synthetic compound 
was obtained with a very good yield (50%) and presented almost the same effect
compared to the extracted fraction. This study indicates for the first time that 
Streptomyces misionensis V16R3Y1 exhibits a broad spectrum of antimicrobial
activities, produced cyclic dipeptide (l-Leucyl-l-Proline) and might have
potential use as a natural agent for pharmaceutical and agri-food applications.
