Certain Desulfovibrio sp. (anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria) are indigenous to
swine cecum and colon, which are also common habitats for parasitic amoebae such 
as Entamoeba polecki and Entamoeba suis. In this study, we evaluated the
growth-promoting effects of D. desulfuricans co-cultured with Escherichia coli
(DH5α) and its products [e.g., hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and certain iron-sulfide
(FeS) compounds] using Robinson's medium, on the 4 amoeba isolates from
swine-Entamoeba polecki subtype (ST)-1, E. polecki ST-3, Entamoeba suis, and
Endolimax sp., and, consequently, a continuous culture system for these amoebae
was established. However, this novel culture system was required to regulate the 
excess H2S dissolved in the medium by increasing air space as amoeba isolates
thrive only in large air spaces (30-40%). The effects of air space and H2S and
FeS compounds on the growth of E. polecki ST-1 (TDP-5) were determined. E.
polecki ST-1 (TDP-5) thrived well in culture bottles with an air space of 30-40% 
(aerobic) (H2S: ~250-400 μmoles/L), but did not grow at all in an air space < 5% 
(microaerobic) ( H2S:~800 μmoles/L) and in anaerobic vessels (H2S: 20-30
μmoles/L). In both H2S-depleted and FeS compound-depleted conditions, the amoebae
sp. could not thrive either. It was hypothesized that an appropriate
concentration of H2S and FeS compounds might function as important
physiologically active components of electron carriers such as FeS and
ferredoxin.
