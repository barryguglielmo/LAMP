Gemella haemolysans is a gram-positive coccoid, facultative anaerobe of the
mucous membranes. In rare cases, it has been identified as an opportunistic
pathogen in the development of endocarditis. Here, we describe a case of
infective endocarditis in a patient with a bicuspid aortic valve. A 38-year-old
man presented with the complaint of exertional dyspnea of one month duration. He 
was found to have leucocytosis and his blood cultures grew Gemella haemolysans.
Trans-esophageal echocardiography showed a bicuspid aortic valve with 1.5 x 1.5
cm vegetative mass, severe aortic regurgitation, and an aortic root abscess. The 
patient was started on intravenous ampicillin and gentamycin. He then underwent
mechanical aortic valve replacement and bovine reconstruction of the left
ventricular outflow tract. Our case highlights the importance of considering
atypical pathogens as causative agents of infective endocarditis.
