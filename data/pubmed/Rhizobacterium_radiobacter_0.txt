A molecular and metabolic behaviour of EPS-producing and salt-tolerant bacterium 
Rhizobium radiobacter SZ4S7S14 along with its practical application in
salt-stress was investigated. The research target was identification and
expression profiles of a large EPS biosynthesis gene cluster, possible structural
modification of EPS under salt-stress effect and analysis of the gene(s) relative
expression and structural modification correlation. As expected, transposons
insertions were identified within or near the coding regions of exoK and exoM,
previously known large gene cluster that is required for EPS I synthesis.
Different expression levels of exoK and exoM in different salt-stress models
resulted in structural modification of EPS, which was seen basically in monomers 
molar ratio. As a result of downregulation of the genes the strain produced EPS
samples with monomers ratio: (1)
Glu:Man:Gal:Xyl:Ara:Rha:Rib = 31.21:3.02:2.77:1:0.91:0.64:0.41 (in 0.25% NaCl);
(2) Glu:Man:Gal:Xyl:Ara:Rha:Rib = 7.65:1:0.69:0.22:0.2:0.16:0.1 (in 0.5% NaCl);
(3) Glu:Man:Gal:Ara:Xyl:Rha:Rib = 9.39:1.89:1:0.58:0.52:0.46:0.26 (in 1% NaCl);
and (4) Glu:Man:Ara:Xyl:Rib:Gal = 7.9:2:2:1.58:1.1:1 (in 2.0% NaCl), whereas in
control (without NaCl):
Glc:Man:Gal:Xyl:Ara:Rha:Rib = 11.66:1:0.90:0.37:0.37:0.15:0.14. It was found
that, salt-stress not only leads to downregulation of a large EPS biosynthesis
gene cluster, including exoK and exoM genes, but also impacting on their relative
expression degree, re-groups of the monomers within the EPS matrix and dictates
molar ratio of the monosaccharides in the final metabolite.
