Oils in food waste can pollute the environment and negatively affect human
health. Biodegradation is a promising method for disposing of waste edible oils. 
In this study, an oil-degrading bacterium was isolated from kitchen waste for
efficient degradation of edible oils. Its growth and oil degradation
characteristics were investigated in basic salt medium with edible oils as the
sole carbon and energy source; the triacylglycerol lipase gene (EC 3.1.1.3) was
cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. A novel oil-degrading bacterium
assigned as IUMR B67 was successfully isolated. Morphological and molecular
analyses revealed that strain IUMR B67 belongs to Kosakonia cowanii. After 144 h 
of incubation, the oil degradation rate at 37°C was 95.80%. Optimal conditions
for IUMR B67 were recorded at 37°C and 0.1% NaCl with 0.1% ammonium sulfate
supplementation. The lipase gene of strain IUMR B67 was determined to be 912 base
pairs, and the lipase activity of the expressed protein was 3.02 U/mL, which was 
significantly higher than the control (P < 0.05). Overall, Kosakonia cowanii IUMR
B67 is a novel edible oil-degrading strain that can hydrolyze oil via its lipase 
activity, which may be useful in the disposal of oils and oily food waste.
