OBJECTIVE: Laboratory-based characterization and traceback of Clostridium
butyricum isolates linked to outbreak cases of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis
(NEC) in a hospital in China.
METHODS: In total, 37 samples were collected during the NEC outbreak. Classical
bacteriological methods were applied to isolate and identify Clostridium spp.
Meanwhile, 24 samples collected after an outbreak were similarly tested. All
Clostridium isolates were identified to species level as either C. butyricum or
C. sporogenes. These isolates were subsequently subtyped using pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE). Genomic DNA was purified from 2 representative C.
butyricum isolates and sequenced to completion.
RESULTS: Of 37 samples collected during the NEC outbreak, 17 (45.95%) were
positive for Clostridium spp. One species, C. butyricum, was cultured from 10
samples. Another species cultured from 2 other samples was identified as C.
sporogenes. Both of these species were cocultured from 5 samples. Pulsotyping
showed that the 15 C. butyricum and the 7 C. sporogenes isolates produced
indistinguishable DNA profiles. No NEC cases were reported after disinfection
following the outbreak, and all samples collected after the outbreak were
negative for Clostridium spp. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) indicated that
sialidase, hemolysin, and enterotoxin virulence factors were located on the
chromosomes of 2 C. butyricum isolates.
CONCLUSIONS: The outbreak of NEC was epidemiologically linked to C. butyricum
contamination within the hospital. This is the first report of an NEC outbreak
associated with C. butyricum infection in China.
