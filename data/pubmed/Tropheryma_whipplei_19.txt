Well-defined diagnostic gold standards are rarely available for the diagnosis of 
rare diseases such as some tropical infections. Algorithms for reliable test
evaluation without gold standard are therefore desirable. On the basis of
previous work of Gart and Buck (1966); Rogan and Gladen (1978), and Hui and
Walter (1980), a modeling approach for the comparison of diagnostic tests without
a gold standard - and thus without reliably characterized reference sample
material - is established especially for situations not fulfilling the
requirement of conditional independence of the diagnostic tests evaluated. In the
approach introduced, each test is conducted within two populations with different
values of prevalence and the test results are used to define two virtual
reference tests. The model is useful for the comparison of tests for rare
tropical diseases where no gold standard can be provided.
