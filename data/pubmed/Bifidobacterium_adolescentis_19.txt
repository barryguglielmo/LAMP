Lactobacillus reuteri NK33 (NK33) and Bifidobacterium adolescentis NK98 (NK98)
alleviate immobilization stress-induced depression. To understand the gut
microbiota-mediated mechanisms of NK33 and NK98 against depression, we examined
their effects on Escherichia coli K1 (K1)-induced depression and gut dysbiosis in
mice. NK33, NK98, and their mixtures (1:1, 4:1, and 9:1) mitigated K1-induced
depression and colitis. NK33 and NK98 additively or synergistically increased
BDNF+/NeuN+ cell population and suppressed NF-ÎºB action in the hippocampus. They 
alleviated gut dysbiosis by reducing the Proteobacteria population and increasing
the Clostridia population. These results suggest that NK33 and NK98 may alleviate
depression and colitis by ameliorating gut dysbiosis.
