Rhodococcus strain IGTS8 is the most extensively studied model bacterium for
biodesulfurization of fossil fuels via the non-destructive sulfur-specific 4S
pathway. This strain was initially assigned to Rhodococcus rhodochrous and later 
to Rhodococcus erythropolis thus making its taxonomic status debatable and
reflecting the limited resolution of methods available at the time. In this
study, phylogenomic analyses of the whole genome sequences of strain IGTS8 and
closely related rhodococci showed that R. erythropolis and Rhodococcus
qingshengii are very closely related species, that Rhodococcus strain IGTS8 is a 
R. qingshengii strain and that several strains identified as R. erythropolis
should be re-classified as R. qingshengii. The genomes of strains assigned to
these species contain potentially novel biosynthetic gene clusters showing that
members of these taxa should be given greater importance in the search for new
antimicrobials and other industrially important biomolecules. The plasmid-borne
dsz operon encoding fossil fuel desulfurization enzymes was present in R.
qingshengii IGTS8 and R. erythropolis XP suggesting that it might be transferable
between members of these species.
