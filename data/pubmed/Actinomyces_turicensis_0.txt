Actinomyces is a rare cause of prostatic abscess. Most reported cases of
abdominal and pelvic actinomycosis are a consequence of invasive procedures or
abdominal infections. In this report, we present a previously healthy 53-year-old
man with inguinal pain, fever and dysuria who was found to have a prostate
abscess, secondary to Actinomyces turicensis and Peptostreptococcus, which was
removed via transurethral resection of the prostate. This case was complicated by
Peptostreptococcus bacteremia and a facial abscess. The patient was treated with 
antibiotics and ultimately made a full recovery.
