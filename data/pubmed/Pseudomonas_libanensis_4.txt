BACKGROUND: Plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and arbuscular
mycorrhizal (AM) fungi have the ability to enhance the growth, fitness, and
quality of various agricultural crops, including cowpea. However, field trials
confirming the benefits of microbes in large-scale applications using
economically viable and efficient inoculation methods are still scarce. Microbial
seed coating has a great potential for large-scale agriculture through the
application of reduced amounts of PGPR and AM fungi inocula. Thus, in this study,
the impact of seed coating with PGPR, Pseudomonas libanensis TR1 and AM fungus,
Rhizophagus irregularis (single or multiple isolates) on grain yield and nutrient
content of cowpea under low-input field conditions was evaluated.
RESULTS: Seed coating with P. libanensis + multiple isolates of R. irregularis
(coatPMR) resulted in significant increases in shoot dry weight (76%), and in the
number of pods and seeds per plant (52% and 56%, respectively) and grain yield
(56%), when compared with non-inoculated control plants. However, seed coating
with P. libanensis + R. irregularis single-isolate (coatPR) did not influence
cowpea grain yield. Grain lipid content was significantly higher (25%) in coatPMR
plants in comparison with control. Higher soil organic matter and lower pH were
observed in the coatPMR treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that cowpea field productivity can be improved
by seed coating with PGPR and multiple AM fungal isolates under low-input
agricultural systems. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.
