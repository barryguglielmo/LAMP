Soil samples from Kuwait, Lebanon, Egypt and Germany were polluted with 3% crude 
oil. Series of samples were left unbioaugmented, others were bioaugmented with
Kuwaiti desert soil with a long history of oil pollution and still others with
Kuwaiti marine biofouling material. In the samples from Kuwait, Egypt, and
Germany, bioaugmentation did not enhance oil removal, whereas it did in the
sample from Lebanon. Taxa from the desert-soil bioaugmented batches, but none of 
those from the biofouling-material bioaugmented ones, succeeded in colonizing the
four studied soils. The dynamics of the hydrocarbonoclastic communities during
bioremediation were monitored. Those communities differed in composition, not
only according to the type of soil, but also for the same soil; at various phases
of bioremediation. Although each soil seemed to have its characteristic
microflora, they all were similar in harboring lower and higher actinomycetes and
pseudomonads in addition to many other taxa. None of the taxa prevailed through
all phases of bioremediation. The most powerful isolate in oil-removal; was
Rhodococcus erythropolis (Germany), and the weakest was Arthrobacter
phenanthrenivorans (Lebanon). The pure hydrocarbonoclastic isolates tolerated
unusually high oil concentrations, up to 30%.
