Aggregatibacter aphrophilus, previously Haemophilus aphrophilus, is an uncommon
organism that historically has been associated with HACEK infective endocarditis 
and brain abscesses. This organism is most often isolated as part of normal oral 
flora, and patients with A. aphrophilus infection usually have an underlying
periodontal infection or immunocompromised state allowing for infection. This
case report outlines a unique presentation of left superficial temporal abscess
due to A. aphrophilus infection in an immunocompetent individual.
