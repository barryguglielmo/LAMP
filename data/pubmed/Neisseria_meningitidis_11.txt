vaccines.

Factor H binding protein (FHbp) is an important Neisseria meningitidis (Nm)
virulence factor that binds a negative regulator of the alternative complement
pathway, human Factor H (FH). Binding of FH increases meningococcal resistance to
complement-mediated killing. FHbp also is reported to prevent interaction of the 
antimicrobial peptide (AMP) LL-37 with the meningococcal surface and
meningococcal killing. FHbp is a target of two licensed group B-directed
meningococcal (MenB) vaccines. We found a new FHbp variant, peptide allele ID
896, was highly expressed by an emerging meningococcal pathotype, the
non-encapsulated clade (US_NmUC). This clade is responsible for outbreaks of
urethritis in multiple US cities since 2015, other mucosal infections, and cases 
of invasive meningococcal disease. FHbp ID 896, is a member of the variant group 
1 (subfamily B), bound protective anti-FHbp monoclonal antibodies, bound high
levels of human FH, and enhanced the resistance of the clade to
complement-mediated killing in low levels of human complement likely present at
human mucosal surfaces. Interestingly, expression of FHbp ID 896 resulted in
augmented killing of the clade by LL-37. FHbp ID 896 of the clade was recognized 
by antibodies elicited by FHbp in MenB vaccines.
