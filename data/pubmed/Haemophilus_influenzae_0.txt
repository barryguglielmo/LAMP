BACKGROUND: An Australian study including 4433 children found that delayed
Diphtheria-Tetanus-acellular Pertussis containing vaccination was associated with
reduced risk of developing atopic dermatitis (AD) before 1 year of age. OBJECTI: 
ve We assessed if delayed vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, acellular
pertussis, polio, and Haemophilus Influenzae type b (DTaP) was associated with a 
reduced risk of new cases of AD before 1 year of age in Denmark.
METHOD: s We used nationwide registers to follow 883,160 children born in Denmark
from 1997 to 2012. Binary regression models adjusting for potential confounding
factors were applied to estimate relative risks (aRR) of developing AD among
children with delayed DTaP vaccination (defined as given 1 month or more after
the recommended age) compared with timely vaccinated children.
RESULTS: Among 143,429 children with a delayed first dose of DTaP, 4847 (3.4%)
developed AD between 4 months and 1 year of age, compared with 27,628 (3.7%)
among 739,731 children not having delayed DTaP (aRR 0.94 (95% confidence interval
(CI): 0.91-0.97)). The aRR was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.90-0.99) for children with a
delayed second dose, and aRR=0.88 (95% CI: 0.2-0.93) comparing children with
delayed first and second dose with all timely vaccinated children.
CONCLUSION: The results support the hypothesis that delayed vaccination with DTaP
is associated with reduced risk of developing new cases of AD after 4 months of
age. The dose-dependent relationship strengthens the evidence of a causal
relationship. Some countries are introducing maternal pertussis vaccination and
delaying the first dose of DTaP, providing a possibility for further testing the 
hypothesis.
