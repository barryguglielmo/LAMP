Childhood tuberculosis (TB) is a significant public health problem and the ninth 
leading cause of death worldwide. Progression of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
infection to active disease depends on mycobacterial virulence, environmental
diversity, and host susceptibility and immune response. In children, malnutrition
and immaturity of the immune system contribute to an inadequate immune response. 
Coinfections, though rarely described in TB, might be associated with host immune
deficiencies. Here, we describe the immunological evaluation of eight pediatric
patients infected with a member of the M. tuberculosis complex, most of them with
concomitant pulmonary infections (bacteria, viruses, or fungi). We assessed the
functionality of several innate immunity receptors, IL-12 receptor, and IFN-γ
receptor, as well as the antioxidant levels (glutathione), which are essential
mechanisms for fighting intracellular pathogens such as M. tuberculosis. This
study is aimed at developing a thorough immunological evaluation of patients with
TB and a coinfection.
