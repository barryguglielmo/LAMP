BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) as a complementary step of 
selective removal of dental caries appears as an ideal choice to help manage
caries with minimal interventions. Sub-lethal dose of aPDT (sPDT) impressively
affects microbial virulence, although it does not kill microorganisms. Therefore,
the present study aimed to investigate the influence of sPDT using diode laser
plus chlorophyllin-phycocyanin mixture (PhotoActive+) on changes in gtfB gene
expression and the subsequent protein expression of GtfB.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: sPDT using PhotoActive+ and 635 ± 10 nm diode laser was
used to examine the expression of gtfB mRNA and GtfB protein expression of
Streptococcus mutans by quantitative Real time PCR (qRT-PCR) method and sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), respectively.
RESULTS: In this study, sPDT using 2.4 × 10-3 mol/L PhotoActive+ with 3 min
irradiation time of diode laser with energy density of 104 J/cm2, significantly
reduced the gtfB gene expression with rates of 3.5-fold (P < 0.05). Also,
PhotoActive+ mediated sPDT demonstrated a significant reduction in GtfB protein
expression of S. mutans up to 54% (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the potential effect of PhotoActive+
mediated sPDT on one of the most important virulence factors of S. mutans.
