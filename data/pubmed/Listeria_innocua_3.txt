A model describing Listeria innocua evolution according to process parameters of 
51 Italian salami processes and HPP in 31 companies was developed. A total of 51 
challenge tests were performed. During processing a L. innocua reduction of
0.34-4.32 Log10 CFU/g was observed and HPP further reduced the count of 0.48-3.47
Log10 CFU/g; an overall reduction of 1.04-5.68 is reached. PH after
acidification/drying process, aw after seasoning, duration of the seasoning and
caliber resulted associated (p < 0.05) with L. innocua decrease. HPP efficacy was
associated (p < 0.05) with aw and pH of the product: higher the pH and aw after
the acidification/drying and seasoning phases, higher resulted the L. innocua
reduction after HPP. No significant association was observed between L.innocua
and salt, nitrate and starter content and other characteristics of process. The
model meets companies and Authorities needs and represents a useful tool to
predict L. monocytogenes lethality, giving recommendations to food business
operators interested in exportation to the U.S.
