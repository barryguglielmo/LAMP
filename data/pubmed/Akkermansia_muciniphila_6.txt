Infections elicit immune adaptations to enable pathogen resistance and/or
tolerance and are associated with compositional shifts of the intestinal
microbiome. However, a comprehensive understanding of how infections with
pathogens that exhibit distinct capability to spread and/or persist
differentially change the microbiome, the underlying mechanisms, and the relative
contribution of individual commensal species to immune cell adaptations is still 
lacking. Here, we discovered that mouse infection with a fast-spreading and
persistent (but not a slow-spreading acute) isolate of lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus induced large-scale microbiome shifts characterized by
increased Verrucomicrobia and reduced Firmicute/Bacteroidetes ratio. Remarkably, 
the most profound microbiome changes occurred transiently after infection with
the fast-spreading persistent isolate, were uncoupled from sustained viral loads,
and were instead largely caused by CD8 T cell responses and/or CD8 T cell-induced
anorexia. Among the taxa enriched by infection with the fast-spreading virus,
Akkermansia muciniphila, broadly regarded as a beneficial commensal, bloomed upon
starvation and in a CD8 T cell-dependent manner. Strikingly, oral administration 
of A. muciniphila suppressed selected effector features of CD8 T cells in the
context of both infections. Our findings define unique microbiome differences
after chronic versus acute viral infections and identify CD8 T cell responses and
downstream anorexia as driver mechanisms of microbial dysbiosis after infection
with a fast-spreading virus. Our data also highlight potential context-dependent 
effects of probiotics and suggest a model in which changes in host behavior and
downstream microbiome dysbiosis may constitute a previously unrecognized negative
feedback loop that contributes to CD8 T cell adaptations after infections with
fast-spreading and/or persistent pathogens.
