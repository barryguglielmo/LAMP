In a cohort of infants, we found that lack of the Lewis histo-blood group antigen
was associated with increased susceptibility to shigellosis. Broadly inhibiting
fucosylation in epithelial cells in vitro decreased invasion by Shigella
flexneri. These results support a role for fucosylated glycans in susceptibility 
to shigellosis.
