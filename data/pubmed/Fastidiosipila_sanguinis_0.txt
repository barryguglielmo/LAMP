Moryella indoligenes and Fastidiosipila sanguinis are obligate anaerobic
Gram-positive bacteria that are rarely involved in human infections. We present
the first case of bacteraemia with M. indoligenes , which was part of a
co-infection with F. sanguinis . Both micro-organisms were identified by 16S rRNA
gene sequencing and M. indoligenes was also identified by matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Prostate
cancer involving the bladder suggests that the urinary tract was the most likely 
primary site of infection.
