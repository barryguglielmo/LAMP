Galectins are the family of carbohydrate-binding proteins that participate in
host-pathogen interaction. In this study, a galectin-4 homolog (OnGal-4) from
Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) was characterized. The open reading frame of
OnGal-4 was 1194 bp, encoding a peptide of 397 amino including two CRD regions
and two carbohydrate recognition sites. OnGal-4 mRNA was expressed in all
examined tissues with the highest level in spleen. After Streptococcus agalactiae
(S.agalactiae) challenge, the OnGal-4 expression was up-regulated in the spleen, 
head kidney, brain, and monocytes/macrophages (Mo/MΦ). The in vitro experiments
showed that recombinant OnGal-4 (rOnGal-4) protein could bind and agglutinate
S.agalactiae and A.hydrophila. Also, rOnGal-4 could induce cytokines expressions 
and increased bactericidal activity of Mo/MΦ. Further in vivo analysis indicated 
that OnGal-4 overexpression could protect O.niloticus from S.agalactiae infection
through modulating inflammation response. Our study suggested that OnGal-4 could 
improve immune response against bacterial infection by mediating pathogen
recognition and opsonization.
