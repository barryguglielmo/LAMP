Fermented vinegar is prepared from grains and medicinal plants. Here, we produced
vinegar from peeled and unpeeled roots of bellflowers (Platycodon grandiflorum)
using Acetobacter pasteurianus A11-2 and analyzed bellflower vinegar (BV) samples
using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and quadrupole time-of-flight mass
spectrometry over 15 days of fermentation to assess the quality. We also
evaluated their antibacterial and immunoenhancing effects using RAW 264.7
macrophage cells. The major metabolites in BV are organic acids, with the main
volatile compounds being ethyl acetate, isoamyl acetate, 1-pentanol,
hydroxypropanoic acid, and malonic acid. When we fermented BV from unpeeled roots
for 10 days with a starter culture, we observed significant antibacterial and
immunoenhancing effects in macrophages. Therefore, we could determine the
metabolite and functional differences in vinegar obtained from bellflower roots
and proposed that bellflower roots with peel are an effective substrate for
developing vinegar and healthy food products.
