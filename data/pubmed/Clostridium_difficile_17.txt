Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is the infusion of feces from a healthy
donor into the gut of a recipient to treat a dysbiosis-related disease. FMT has
been proven to be a safe and effective treatment for Clostridioides difficile
infection, but increasing evidence supports the role of FMT in other
gastrointestinal and extraintestinal diseases. The aim of this review is to paint
the landscape of current evidence of FMT in different fields of application
(including irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, liver disorders,
decolonization of multidrug-resistant bacteria, metabolic disorders
andÂ neurological disorders), as well as to discuss the current regulatory
scenario of FMT, and hypothesize future directions of FMT.
