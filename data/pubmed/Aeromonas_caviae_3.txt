Mangrove sediment-associated bacteria are of significantly important in the field
of medicine and pharmaceuticals as new promising sources of biologically active
pharmacophores due to the extreme conditions, such as high salt concentration and
soil anoxia. The sediment bacteria associated with Acanthus ilicifolius and
Avicennia officinalis collected from the Mangalavanam mangrove ecosystem of the
Kerala State of India were evaluated using various in vitro models for the
assessment of their pharmacological properties. The bacteria exhibiting
significant antioxidant and antimicrobial activities were isolated, identified,
and characterized by the integrated microbiological, biochemical, and 16S rRNA
sequencing. Among the varied bacteria isolated from mangrove sediments, Bacillus 
amyloliquefaciens MBMS5 (GenBank accession number MK765025) exhibited significant
antimicrobial activities against various pathogenic bacteria, such as Aeromonas
caviae, Vibrio parahemolyticus, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. 
The extracellular extracts of B. amyloliquefaciens MBMS5 exhibited potential
antioxidant activity against free radical species coupled with anti-inflammatory 
property as displayed by the attenuation activity against pro-inflammatory
5-lipoxygenase.
