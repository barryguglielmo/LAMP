Recent concerns over linkages between antimicrobial resistance in human pathogens
and antimicrobial use in livestock have prompted researchers to investigate
management strategies that reduce the current reliance on in-feed tylosin to
control liver abscesses in feedlot cattle. A total of 7,576 crossbred yearlings
were allocated to the study (~253 animals/pen, 10 replicate pens per treatment)
and individually randomized to one of three treatments. Tylosin phosphate (11
ppm) was included in-feed (1) for the first 125 days on feed (DOF) (FIRST-78%),
(2) for DOF 41 to 161 (LAST-75%), or (3) for the entire feeding period (CON; day 
0-161). Fecal composites were collected from the pen floor on days 0, 81, and 160
of the finishing period. Serial dilutions were spread plated for enumeration of
enterococci on Bile Esculin Azide (BEA) agar and BEA amended with 8 μg/ml
erythromycin. Results indicated that although the proportion of EryR enterococci 
increased with DOF (P < 0.01), neither treatment (P = 0.34) or treatment × DOF (P
= 0.37) affected antimicrobial resistance. Of the 538 isolates, 97% were
enterococci, with mixed species isolated early in the feeding period and only
Enterococcus hirae isolated at the end. Isolates were most frequently resistant
to tylosin (86%), erythromycin (84%), and doxycycline (31%). Macrolide and
tetracycline resistant isolates harbored erm(B), msrC, and tet(L), tet(M), tet(O)
genes, respectively. Overall, the proportion of EryR enterococci increased (P <
0.05) in all three treatments over the feeding period. Compared to the control
cattle, FIRST-78% cattle had more severe (P < 0.05) liver abscesses, while there 
was a trend (P < 0.08) for this response in LAST-75% cattle. There was no
difference (P > 0.05) in total liver abscesses, growth performance, carcass
traits, morbidity, or mortality among treatments. These results support the
potential to reduce the duration and therefore quantity of tylosin administered
to feedlot cattle during the feeding period without impacting animal
productivity.
