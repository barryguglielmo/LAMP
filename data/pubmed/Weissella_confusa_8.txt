BACKGROUND: Bacteriocins (Bac1, Bac2, and Bac3) from Weissella confusa MBF8-1,
weissellicin-MBF, have been reported as potential alternative substances as well 
as complements to the existing antibiotics against many antimicrobial-resistant
pathogens. Previously, the genes encoded in the large plasmid, pWcMBF8-1, and the
spermicidal activity of their synthetic peptides, have been studied in originally
discovered Indonesia. Three synthetic bacteriocins peptides of this
weissellicin-MBF have been reported as well for their potential activities, i.e. 
antibacterial and spermicidal.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to construct the recombinant Bacteriocin
(r-Bac) genes, as well as to investigate the genes expressions and their
functional analysis.
METHOD: Here, we constructed the recombinant Bacteriocin (r-Bac) genes and
produced the recombinant peptides (r-Bac1, rBac2, and r-Bac3) in B. subtilis
DB403 cells in a large scale. After purification using the His-tag affinity
column, their potential bioactivities measured as antibacterial minimum
inhibitory concentrations against Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Micrococcus
luteus were determined.
RESULTS: Pure His-tag-recombinant Bac1, Bac2, and Bac3 were obtained and they
could inhibit the growth of L. mesenteroides and M. luteus.
CONCLUSION: The recombinant bacteriocin could be obtained although with weak
activity in inhibiting gram-positive bacterial growth.
