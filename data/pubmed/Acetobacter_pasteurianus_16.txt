Thermotolerant strains are critical for low-cost high temperature fermentation.
In this study, we carried out the thermal adaptation of A. pasteurianus IFO
3283-32 under acetic acid fermentation conditions using an experimental evolution
approach from 37ºC to 40ºC. The adapted strain exhibited an increased growth and 
acetic acid fermentation ability at high temperatures, however, with the
trade-off response of the opposite phenotype at low temperatures. Genome analysis
followed by PCR sequencing showed that the most adapted strain had 11 mutations, 
a single 64-kb large deletion, and a single plasmid loss. Comparative phenotypic 
analysis showed that at least the large deletion (containing many ribosomal RNAs 
and tRNAs genes) and a mutation of DNA polymerase (one of the 11 mutations)
critically contributed to this thermotolerance. The relationship between the
phenotypic changes and the gene mutations are discussed, comparing with another
thermally adapted A. pasteurianus strains obtained previously.
