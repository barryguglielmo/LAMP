Flumequine was nano-immobilized by self-assembly on iron oxide nanoparticles,
called surface active maghemite nanoparticles (SAMNs). The binding process was
studied and the resulting core-shell nanocarrier (SAMN@FLU) was structurally
characterized evidencing a firmly immobilized organic canopy on which the
fluorine atom of the antibiotic was exposed to the solvent. The antibiotic
efficacy of the SAMN@FLU nanocarrier was tested on a fish pathogenic bacterium
(Aeromonas veronii), a flumequine sensitive strain, in comparison to soluble
flumequine and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum
bactericidal concentration (MBC) were assessed. Noteworthy, the MIC and MBC of
soluble and nanoparticle bound drug were superimposable. Moreover, the
interactions between SAMN@FLU nanocarrrier and microorganism were studied by
transmission electron microscopy evidencing the ability of the complex to disrupt
the bacterial wall. Finally, a preliminary in vivo test was provided using
Daphnia magna as animal model. SAMN@FLU was able to protect the crustacean from
the fatal consequences of a bacterial infection and showed no sign of toxicity.
Thus, in contrast with the strength of the interaction, nano-immobilized FLU
displayed a fully preserved antimicrobial activity suggesting the crucial role of
fluorine in the drug mechanism of action. Besides the importance for potential
applications in aquaculture, the present study contributes to the nascent field
of nanoantibiotics.
