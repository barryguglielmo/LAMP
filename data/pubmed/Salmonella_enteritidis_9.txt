Background: Salmonella enteritidis causes infections in humans and animals.
Antibiotics are used to eliminate bacterial infections, which become resistant to
antibiotics after a while. This study aimed to isolate S. enteritidis from cattle
feces samples and also to evaluate the frequency of genes associated with
multi-drug resistance (MDR).
Methods: One hundred ten fecal samples of cattle were collected from Jul to Dec, 
2017 in Khuzestan Province, southern Iran. Bacterial culture and molecular
methods were used to isolate and identify S. enteritidis. Disk diffusion method
was used to assess antibiotic susceptibility. Then Polymerase chain reaction
(PCR), assay was used for definitive diagnosis of S. enteritidis and resistance
genes.
Results: Overall, 101 (91.81%) samples were detected to be contaminated with
Salmonella genus and 86 samples (85.14%) were identified as S. enteritidis. The
highest and lowest antibiotic resistance were belonged to gentamicin (n=70,
81.39%), and tetracycline (n=6, 6.97%). Besides, 64 samples (74.42%) had 2-10
drugs resistance patterns. Moreover, the highest and the least resistance were
related to blaIMP-1 (n=73, 84.88%) and tet(B) (n=49, 56.97%) genes respectively.
Conclusion: The drug-induced genes in S. enteritidis have a high frequency.
Therefore, antibiotic resistance and high MDR to antibiotics can be due to the
incorrect use of antibiotics and the lack of health monitoring in Cattle farms.
