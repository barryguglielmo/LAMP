BACKGROUND: Probiotics use has been associated with modulation of inflammation
and considered as a possible intervention for CNS diseases such as mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) and dementia.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to test the effect of the probiotic strain, Bifidobacterium
breve A1 (MCC1274), to restore cognition in a physically healthy, suspected MCI
population.
METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 80 healthy
older adults suffering from MCI were divided into two even groups to receive once
daily either probiotic (B. breve A1, 2×1010 CFU) or placebo for 16 weeks using a 
computer-generated algorithm. Cognitive functions were assessed by the Repeatable
Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) and the Japanese 
version of the MCI Screen (JMCIS) tests before and after the study as primary and
secondary endpoints, respectively.
RESULTS: 79 participants completed the study, and no adverse events were
observed. RBANS total score was significantly improved in probiotic group
compared with placebo (mean between-group difference 11.3 [95% CI 6.7 to 15.8];
p < 0.0001) after 16 weeks of consumption, in particular with significant
improvement in domain scores of immediate memory, visuospatial/constructional,
and delayed memory (p < 0.0001), in both intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and
per-protocol (PP) analysis. JMCIS score was also improved versus placebo in ITT
analysis (p = 0.052) and PP analysis (p = 0.036).
CONCLUSION: Study results indicate B. breve A1 is a safe and effective approach
for improving memory functions of suspected MCI subjects.
