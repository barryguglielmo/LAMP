Pitina is a fermented sausage-like produced in the mountainous area of the
North-East Italy by artisanal plants without the use of both selected starters
and casing (Slow Food Presidium). Originally, Pitina has been a way of preserving
meat and it is manifactured by meat from ungulates mixed with pork lard, smoked, 
dryed and ripened. In this study, microbial ecology, physic-chemical parameters, 
and volatile aromatic compounds of Pitina SR and LR, which differ by the duration
of ripening processes, were investigated. Results showed the good hygienic
quality. Staphylococcus xylosus and Lactobacillus sakei were responsible for the 
ripening. Other Coagulase-negative Catalase-positive Cocci (CNCPC) and LAB
species were identified: S. equorum, S. warneri, S. succinus and Carnobacterium
divergens, Streptococcus equinus, Kocuria rhizophila. Giberella moniliformis and 
Penicillium turbatum were the only mould species isolated. Strain
characterization demonstrated a high genetic variability. Raw meat, environment
and ripening conditions seemed to affect strains distribution, which had an
impact on the aromatic profile of the product.
