OBJECTIVE: The significance of the liver-microbiome axis has been increasingly
recognised as a major modulator of autoimmunity. The aim of this study was to
take advantage of a large well-defined corticosteroids treatment-naïve group of
patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) to rigorously characterise gut dysbiosis
compared with healthy controls.
DESIGN: We performed a cross-sectional study of individuals with AIH (n=91) and
matched healthy controls (n=98) by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. An independent
cohort of 28 patients and 34 controls was analysed to validate the results. All
the patients were collected before corticosteroids therapy.
RESULTS: The gut microbiome of steroid treatment-naïve AIH was characterised with
lower alpha-diversity (Shannon and observed operational taxonomic units, both
p<0.01) and distinct overall microbial composition compared with healthy controls
(p=0.002). Depletion of obligate anaerobes and expansion of potential pathobionts
including Veillonella were associated with disease status. Of note, Veillonella
dispar, the most strongly disease-associated taxa (p=8.85E-8), positively
correlated with serum level of aspartate aminotransferase and liver inflammation.
Furthermore, the combination of four patients with AIH-associated genera
distinguished AIH from controls with an area under curves of approximately 0.8 in
both exploration and validation cohorts. In addition, multiple predicted
functional modules were altered in the AIH gut microbiome, including
lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis as well as metabolism of amino acids that can be 
processed by bacteria to produce immunomodulatory metabolites.
CONCLUSION: Our study establishes compositional and functional alterations of gut
microbiome in AIH and suggests the potential for using gut microbiota as
non-invasive biomarkers to assess disease activity.
