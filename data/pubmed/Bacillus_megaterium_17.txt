Heavy metals in soil, as selective agents, can change the structure of
plant-associated bacterial communities and their metabolic properties, leading to
the selection of the most-adapted strains, which might be useful in
phytoremediation. Trifolium repens, a heavy metal excluder, naturally occurs on
metal mine waste heaps in southern Poland characterized by high total metal
concentrations. The purpose of the present study was to assess the effects of
toxic metals on the diversity and metabolic properties of the microbial
communities in rhizospheric soil and vegetative tissues of T. repens growing on
three 70-100-years old Zn-Pb mine waste heaps in comparison to
Trifolium-associated bacteria from a non-polluted reference site. In total, 113
cultivable strains were isolated and used for 16S rRNA gene Sanger sequencing in 
order to determine their genetic affiliation and for in vitro testing of their
plant growth promotion traits. Taxa richness and phenotypic diversity in
communities of metalliferous origin were significantly lower (p < 0.0001)
compared to those from the reference site. Two strains, Bacillus megaterium BolR 
EW3_A03 and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia BolN EW3_B03, isolated from a Zn-Pb mine
waste heap which tested positive for all examined plant growth promoting traits
and which showed co-tolerance to Zn, Cu, Cd, and Pb can be considered as
potential facilitators of phytostabilization.
