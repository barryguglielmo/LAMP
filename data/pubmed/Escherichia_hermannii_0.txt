In case of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae infection, the increased
prominence of multidrug-resistance strains has become the greatest challenge in
the urinary tract disease treatment. Therefore, the 16S rRNA sequencing of
multidrug-resistant strains was performed, in addition to those of plasmids and
genes responsible for multidrug resistance. These strains showed containing
responsible genes Sulfonamides sul1, Tetracycline Tet(A), Tetracycline Tet(B),
chloramphenicol catA1, β-lactams blaSHV, and cmlA. Also, the strains demonstrated
resistance to at least 10 types of antibiotics or more due to carrying various
plasmids. For increasing the level of public health in daily life and treatment
of multidrug-resistant bacteria, the nanomedicine was employed. Consequently, ZnO
nanoparticles (ZnONPs-E) were synthesized by employing supernatant of Escherichia
hermannii strain isolated from raw milk source. The E. hermannii strain produces 
high concentration of ZnONPs-E compared to other strains so we used it in this
study. This ZnONPs-E has a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranged from the
concentration 10 μg/ml to 40 μg/ml against E. coli and K. pneumoniae,
respectively. The antimicrobial efficiency of ZnONPs-E was 40 µg/ml and it was
superior to the reported values in literature. Moreover, SEM results evident for 
distorted membrane morphology, blebbing of membrane, cell elongation, and leakage
of cellular contents due to ZnONPs-E activity against tested bacteria. These
results indicated that the ZnONPs-E exhibited interesting antimicrobial activity 
against pathogenic extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) strains. The present
study revealed that the active components entered in biosynthesis of ZnONPs-E
pave the way to lead its effective nano-medical and drug delivery applications.
