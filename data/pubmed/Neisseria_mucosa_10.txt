Rothia mucilaginosa has been found at high abundance on oral leukoplakia (OLK).
The ability of clinical isolates to produce acetaldehyde (ACH) from ethanol has
not been investigated. The objective of the current study was to determine the
capacity of R. mucilaginosa isolates recovered from OLK to generate ACH. Analysis
of R. mucilaginosa genomes (n = 70) shows that this species does not normally
encode acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) required for detoxification of ACH. The 
predicted OLK metagenome also exhibited reduced ALDH coding capacity. We analysed
ACH production in 8 isolates of R. mucilaginosa and showed that this species is
capable of generating ACH in the presence of ethanol. The levels of ACH produced 
(mean = 53 µM) were comparable to those produced by Neisseria mucosa and Candida 
albicans in parallel assays. These levels were demonstrated to induce oxidative
stress in cultured oral keratinocytes. This study shows that R. mucilaginosa can 
generate ACH from ethanol in vitro at levels which can induce oxidative stress.
This organism likely contributes to oral ACH levels following alcohol consumption
and the significance of the increased abundance of R. mucilaginosa in patients
with potentially malignant disorders requires further investigation.
