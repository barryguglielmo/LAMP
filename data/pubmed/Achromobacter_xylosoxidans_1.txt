Arsenite is the predominant arsenic species in flooded paddy soil, and arsenite
bioaccumulation in rice grains has been identified as a major problem in many
Asian countries. Lowering arsenite level in rice plants and grain via
accelerating arsenite oxidation is a potential strategy to help populations, who 
depended on rice consumption, to reduce the internal exposure level of arsenic.
We herein isolated a strain, Achromobacter xylosoxidans GD03, with the high
arsenite-oxidizing ability and plant growth-promoting traits. We observed that
arsenite exposure could promote A. xylosoxidans GD03 to excrete indole-3-acetic
acid and thus promoted rice growth. The pot culture experiments of Indica rice
cultivar Guang You Ming 118 (GYM118) demonstrated that A. xylosoxidans GD03
inoculation of paddy soil (4.5-180 × 108 CFU GD03/kg soil) significantly
accelerated arsenite oxidation in flooded soil. The daily arsenic oxidation rate 
with GD03 inoculation was 1.5-3.3 times as that without strain GD03 inoculation
within the whole growth period of Indica GYM118 in the presence of the native
microflora. It thus led to a 34-69%, 43-74%, 24-76% and 35-57% decrease in
arsenite concentration of the stems, leaves, bran and grain of Indica GYM118
respectively and a 59-96% increase in rice grain yield. The paddy soil inoculated
with 40.0 mL/kg of A. xylosoxidans GD03 resulted in a lowest As(III)
concentrations in all rice organs of Indica GYM118, which equivalent to only
24-50% of the As(III) concentrations in the group without GD03 inoculation. The
results highlight that a highly arsenite-oxidizing bacterium could accelerate
arsenite oxidation of paddy soil when facing competition with the native
microflora, thus decrease arsenic toxicity and bioavailable soil arsenic.
