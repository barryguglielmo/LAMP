Phytoremediation has been considered as a promising technique to decontaminate
polluted soils. However, climatic stress particularly salinity, is a potential
threat to soil properties and plant growth, thus restricting the employment of
this technology. The aim of this study was to access the impact of microbial
inoculation on phytoremediation of nickel (Ni) contaminated saline soils using
Helianthus annuus. Salt resistant plant beneficial bacterium (PBB) Pseudomonas
libanensis TR1 and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) Claroideoglomus claroideum
BEG210 were used. Inoculation of P. libanensis alone or in combination with C.
claroideum significantly enhanced plant growth, changed physiological status
(e.g. electrolyte leakage, chlorophyll, proline and malondialdehyde contents) as 
well as Ni and sodium (Na+) accumulation potential (e.g. uptake and translocation
factor of Ni and Na+) of H. annuus under Ni and salinity stress either alone or
in combination. These results revealed that bioaugmentation of microbial strains 
may serve as a preferred strategy for improving phytoremediation of
metal-polluted saline soils.
