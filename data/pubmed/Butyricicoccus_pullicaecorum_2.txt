It has been largely accepted that dietary changes have an effect on gut microbial
composition. In this pilot study we hypothesised that Ramadan fasting, which can 
be considered as a type of time-restricted feeding may lead to changes in gut
microbial composition and diversity. A total of 9 adult subjects were included in
the study. Stool samples were collected before (baseline) and at the end of the
Ramadan fasting (after 29 days). Following the construction of an 16S rRNA
amplicon library, the V4 region was sequenced using the Illumina Miseq platform. 
Microbial community analysis was performed using the QIIME program. A total of
27,521 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with a 97% similarity were determined
in all of the samples. Microbial richness was significantly increased after
Ramadan according to observed OTU results (P=0.016). No significant difference
was found in terms of Shannon index or phylogenetic diversity metrics of alpha
diversity. Microbial community structure was significantly different between
baseline and after Ramadan samples according to unweighted UniFrac analysis
(P=0.025). LEfSe analysis revealed that Butyricicoccus, Bacteroides,
Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, Allobaculum, Eubacterium, Dialister and
Erysipelotrichi were significantly enriched genera after the end of Ramadan
fasting. According to random forest analysis, the bacterial species most affected
by the Ramadan fasting was Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum. Despite this is a pilot 
study with a limited sample size; our results clearly revealed that Ramadan
fasting, which represents an intermittent fasting regime, leads to compositional 
changes in the gut microbiota.
