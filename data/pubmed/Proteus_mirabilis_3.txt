Background: The occurrence of urinary tract infection in presence of urolithiasis
is frequently noted; however, microbial agents of urolithiasis and their
antimicrobial susceptibility patterns remain underinvestigated. This study aimed 
to identify the microorganisms isolated from urine and stone matrices to
determine their antimicrobial susceptibility, to find the association between the
pathogens of urine and stone matrices, and to perform the biochemical analysis of
stones.
Methods: A total of 88 cases of urolithiasis admitted for elective stone removal 
at Department of surgery, B.P. Koirala Institute of Health Sciences (BPKIHS),
were enrolled. Preoperative urine culture and postoperative stone culture were
performed. Isolation, identification, and AST were done by the standard
microbiological technique. Further qualitative biochemical analysis of stones was
also attempted.
Result: Among 88 stone formers recruited, culture of urine, whole stone, and
nidus yielded the growth of bacteria 44, 32, and 30, respectively. Bacteria
isolated from urine culture correlated with those from stone matrices with a
sensitivity of 90%, specificity of 79.69%, PPV of 63.64%, and NPV of 95.45%.
Escherichia coli (46.7%) was the most common bacteria followed by Klebsiella
pneumoniae (16.7%) and Proteus mirabilis (13.3%) from urine and stone cultures.
Almost all the uropathogens isolated were susceptible to commonly used
antibiotics. Calcium oxalate (84.1%) was common biochemical constituent found in 
stone formers followed by calcium oxalate + phosphate (8%).
Conclusions: The association of microorganism isolated from urine and nidus
culture was significant that can predict the source of infective stone; however, 
in some cases, microorganisms and the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern from
urine and nidus were different. This study emphasizes the use of appropriate
antimicrobial agents to prevent the regrowth of residual stones and minimize the 
risk of infectious complications after surgical removal of stones.
