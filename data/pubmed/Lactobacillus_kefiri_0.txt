S-layer (glyco)-proteins (SLPs) form a nanostructured envelope that covers the
surface of different prokaryotes and show immunomodulatory activity. Previously, 
we have demonstrated that the S-layer glycoprotein from probiotic Lactobacillus
kefiri CIDCA 8348 (SLP-8348) is recognized by Mincle (macrophage inducible C-type
lectin receptor) and its adjuvanticity depends on the integrity of its glycans.
However, the glycan's structure has not been described so far. Herein, we analyze
the glycosylation pattern of three SLPs, SLP-8348, SLP-8321, and SLP-5818, and
explore how these patterns impact their recognition by C-type lectin receptors
(CLRs) and the immunomodulatory effect of the L. kefiri SLPs on
antigen-presenting cells. HPAEC-PAD performed after β-elimination showed glucose 
as the major component in the O-glycans of the three SLPs, however, some
differences in the length of hexose chains were observed. No N-glycosylation
signals were detected in SLP-8348 and SLP-8321, but SLP-5818 was observed to have
two sites carrying complex N-glycans based on a site-specific analysis and a
glycomic workflow of the permethylated glycans. SLP-8348 was previously shown to 
enhance LPS-induced activation on both RAW264.7 macrophages and murine BMDCs; we 
now show SLP-8321 and SLP-5818 have a similar effect regardless of the
differences in their glycosylation patterns. Studies performed with BMDCs from
CLR-deficient mice revealed that the immunostimulatory activity of SLP-8321
depends on its recognition by Mincle, whereas SLP-5818's effects are dependent on
SignR3 (murine ortholog of human DC-SIGN). These findings encourage further
investigation of both the potential application of these SLPs as new adjuvants
and the protein glycosylation mechanisms in these bacteria.
