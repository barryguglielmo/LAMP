p-Benzoquinone (BQ) is a lignin-derived inhibitor to microbial strains. Unlike
the furan inhibitors, p-benzoquinone is recalcitrant to traditional
detoxification methods. This study shows a biological degradation of
p-benzoquinone and a simultaneous D-lactic acid fermentation by an engineered
Pediococcus acidilactici strain. The overexpression of an oxidoreductase gene
ZMO1116 from Zymomonas mobilis encoding oxidoreductase was identified to improve 
the D-lactic acid fermentability of P. acidilactici against p-benzoquinone. The
gene ZMO1116 was integrated into the genome of P. acidilactici and enabled the
engineered P. acidilactici to convert p-benzoquinone into less toxic hydroquinone
(HQ), resulting in the improved p-benzoquinone tolerance. Simultaneous
saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF) was conducted using the pretreated
and biodetoxified corn stover containing p-benzoquinone, the D-lactic acid
production of the engineered strain (123.8 g/L) was 21.4 % higher than the
parental strain (102.0 g/L). This study provides a practical method on robust
p-benzoquinone tolerance and efficient cellulosic chiral lactic acid fermentation
from lignocellulose feedstock.
