In the present work the effect of three factors: pH, temperature and type of
microorganism using a factorial design 32x2 was evaluated on: growth, total
cellulases hydrolytic activity (FPases), endoglucanases hydrolytic activity
(CMCases), free reducing sugars (FRS), glucose, sucrose, and alcohol production
using a culture medium based on mineral salts added with cladodes flour of
Opuntia ficus-indica at 20% as the unique carbon source. Two wild microorganisms 
were used, Acinetobacter pittii a bacteria isolated from decaying cladodes, and
Kluyveromyces marxianus a yeast isolated from termite stomach. The maximum
hydrolytic activities were obtained with Acinetobacter pittii at 37 °C and pH 6.5
for total cellulases (0.67 ± 0.02 IU/ml) and for endoglucanases (0.23 ± 0.02
IU/ml) at 24 and 4 h. The maximum production of alcohol was 12.98 ± 0.06 g/L
obtained with Kluyveromyces marxianus at 4 h with conditions of 40 °C and pH 5.5.
