Objectives: We previously conducted an in silico research on the interactions
between the ribosome display-selected single chain variable fragment (scFv) and
factor H binding protein (fHbp) of Neisseria meningitidis. We found that heavy
chain variable (VH) fragment of this scFv had considerable affinity to fHbp.
These results led us to evaluate the ability of this small antibody fragment in
binding and detection of fHbp antigen.
Materials and Methods: In this study, at first, the three-dimensional structure
of VH fragment was simulated by Kotai Antibody Builder web server. By using
ClusPro 2.0 web server, the 3D structure of the soluble form of fHbp (PDB: 2KC0) 
was docked to the modeled VH fragment to extract the structure of the complex's
binding. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was carried out using GROMACS 4.5.3
package for 65 ns. Secondly, coding sequence of VH fragment was cloned separately
and expressed in Escherichia coli. After purification of the VH fragment, its
binding activity to fHbp protein was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) method.
Results: Important amino acids involved in antigen- antibody interaction were
identified by analyzing the fHbp-VH complex. The ability of the VH antibody
fragment to bind and detect fHbp antigen has been confirmed by the results of in 
silico analysis, ELISA and SPR methods.
Conclusion: These results showed that this small fragment of antibody could be
used for designing diagnostic kits.
