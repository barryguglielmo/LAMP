With the progressive increase in human activities in the Antarctic region, the
possibility of domestic oil spillage also increases. Developing means for the
removal of oils, such as canola oil, from the environment and waste "grey" water 
using biological approaches is therefore desirable, since the thermal process of 
oil degradation is expensive and ineffective. Thus, in this study an indigenous
cold-adapted Antarctic soil bacterium, Rhodococcus erythropolis strain AQ5-07,
was screened for biosurfactant production ability using the multiple approaches
of blood haemolysis, surface tension, emulsification index, oil spreading, drop
collapse and "MATH" assay for cellular hydrophobicity. The growth kinetics of the
bacterium containing different canola oil concentration was studied. The strain
showed β-haemolysis on blood agar with a high emulsification index and low
surface tension value of 91.5% and 25.14 mN/m, respectively. Of the models
tested, the Haldane model provided the best description of the growth kinetics,
although several models were similar in performance. Parameters obtained from the
modelling were the maximum specific growth rate (qmax), concentration of
substrate at the half maximum specific growth rate, Ks% (v/v) and the inhibition 
constant Ki% (v/v), with values of 0.142 h-1, 7.743% (v/v) and 0.399% (v/v),
respectively. These biological coefficients are useful in predicting growth
conditions for batch studies, and also relevant to "in field" bioremediation
strategies where the concentration of oil might need to be diluted to non-toxic
levels prior to remediation. Biosurfactants can also have application in enhanced
oil recovery (EOR) under different environmental conditions.
