Birth by Caesarean (C)-section impacts early gut microbiota colonization and is
associated with an increased risk of developing immune and metabolic disorders.
Moreover, alterations of the microbiome have been shown to affect
neurodevelopmental trajectories. However, the long-term effects of C-section on
neurobehavioral processes remain unknown. Here, we demonstrated that birth by
C-section results in marked but transient changes in microbiome composition in
the mouse, in particular, the abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. was depleted in
early life. Mice born by C-section had enduring social, cognitive, and anxiety
deficits in early life and adulthood. Interestingly, we found that these specific
behavioral alterations induced by the mode of birth were also partially corrected
by co-housing with vaginally born mice. Finally, we showed that supplementation
from birth with a Bifidobacterium breve strain, or with a dietary prebiotic
mixture that stimulates the growth of bifidobacteria, reverses selective
behavioral alterations in C-section mice. Taken together, our data link the gut
microbiota to behavioral alterations in C-section-born mice and suggest the
possibility of developing adjunctive microbiota-targeted therapies that may help 
to avert long-term negative consequences on behavior associated with C-section
birth mode.
