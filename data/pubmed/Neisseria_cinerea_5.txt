Quinolone resistance is increasing in Neisseria meningitidis, with its prevalence
in China being high (>70%), but its origin remains unknown. The aim of this study
was to investigate the donors of mutation-harboring gyrA alleles in N.
meningitidis A total of 198 N. meningitidis isolates and 293 commensal Neisseria 
isolates were collected between 2005 and 2018 in Shanghai, China. The MICs of
ciprofloxacin were determined using the agar dilution method. The
resistance-associated genes gyrA and parC were sequenced for all isolates, while 
a few isolates were sequenced on the Illumina platform. The prevalences of
quinolone resistance in the N. meningitidis and commensal Neisseria isolates were
67.7% (134/198) and 99.3% (291/293), respectively. All 134 quinolone-resistant N.
meningitidis isolates possessed mutations in T91 (n = 123) and/or D95 (n = 12) of
GyrA, with 7 isolates also harboring ParC mutations and exhibiting higher MICs.
Phylogenetic analysis of the gyrA sequence identified six clusters. Among the 71 
mutation-harboring gyrA alleles found in 221 N. meningitidis isolates and genomes
(n = 221), 12 alleles (n = 103, 46.6%) were included in the N. meningitidis
cluster, while 20 alleles (n = 56) were included in the N. lactamica cluster, 27 
alleles (n = 49) were included in the N. cinerea cluster, and 9 alleles (n = 10) 
were included in the N. subflava cluster. Genomic analyses identified the exact
N. lactamica donors of seven mutation-harboring gyrA alleles (gyrA92, gyrA97,
gyrA98, gyrA114, gyrA116, gyrA151, and gyrA230) and the N. subflava donor isolate
of gyrA171, with the sizes of the recombinant fragments ranging from 634 to
7,499 bp. Transformation of gyrA fragments from these donor strains into a
meningococcal isolate increased its ciprofloxacin MIC from 0.004 μg/ml to 0.125
or 0.19 μg/ml and to 0.5 μg/ml with further transformation of an additional ParC 
mutation. Over half of the quinolone-resistant N. meningitidis isolates acquired 
resistance by horizontal gene transfer from three commensal Neisseria species.
Quinolone resistance in N. meningitidis increases in a stepwise manner.
