Three morphological mutants (M71a, M71b, M71c) of the antagonist Pseudomonas
chlororaphis M71, naturally arose during a biocontrol trial against the
phytopathogenic fungus Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersisci. In this
study, the three mutants were investigated to elucidate their role in the
biocontrol of plant pathogens. M71a and M71b phenotypes were generated by a
mutation in the two-component system GacS/GacA. The mutation determined an
increase in siderophore production and an impaired ability to release proteases, 
to swarm, to produce phenazine and AHLs and to colonize tomato roots. In vitro
antagonistic activity against different plant pathogens was partially reduced in 
M71a, while M71b resulted effective only against Pythium ultimum. Biocontrol
efficacy against Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersisci, was partially
reduced in M71a and completely lost in M71b. M71c phenotype was impaired in
swarming motility, did not produce biofilms and its antagonistic activity was
similar to the parental M71 strain. M71c showed an enhanced ability to colonize
tomato roots, on which its progeny in part reverted to the M71 parental
phenotype. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by all four strains,
inhibited the growth of Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis and
Seiridium cardinale in vitro. Real-time screening of VOCs by PTR-MS combined with
GC-MS analysis, showed that methanethiol was the main component of the blend
produced by all four M71 strains. However, the emissions of hydrogen cyanide,
dimethyl disulfide, 1,3-butadiene and acetone were significantly affected by the 
three different mutations. These findings highlight that the simultaneous
presence of different M71 phenotypes may improve, through the integration of
different mechanisms, the ecological fitness and biocontrol efficacy of P.
chlororaphis M71.
