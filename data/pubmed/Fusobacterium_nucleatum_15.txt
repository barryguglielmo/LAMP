OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the subgingival microbiological changes during the first
six months of therapy with clear aligners (CAs) and fixed appliances (FAs). The
null hypothesis was that there would be no microbiological differences between
the two.
SETTING/SAMPLE: Two groups of patients to be treated, respectively, with CAs (14 
patients; 9 females and 5 males; mean age 21 years ± 0.25) and FAs (13 patients; 
8 females and 5 males; mean 14 years ± 0.75), were consecutively recruited.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subgingival microbiological samples were obtained at the
right upper central incisor and right first molar at four different time-points: 
before appliance fitting (T0), and at 1 month (T1), 3 months (T3) and 6 months
(T6) thereafter. Total bacterial load (TBL) and counts of the bacteria
Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium
nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Treponema denticola and Tannerella forsythia
were determined using real time PCR.
RESULTS: TBL did not vary in the CA group, while a significant increase was
detected after 3 and 6 months of treatment in the FA group. Unlike red complex
species, C. rectus and F. nucleatum were often detected: levels remained stable
in the CA group but increased progressively in the FA group.
CONCLUSION: The type of orthodontic appliance influences the subgingival
microbiota. TBL increased in the FA group but not in the CA group, although the
levels of the individual periodontal pathogenic bacteria species did not
significantly increase during the observation period.
