Pediococcus pentosaceus LBM 18 has shown potential as producer of an
antibacterial and antifungal bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (BLIS). BLIS
inhibited the growth of spoilage bacteria belonging to Lactobacillus,
Enterococcus and Listeria genera with higher activity than Nisaplin used as
control. It gave rise to inhibition halos with diameters from 9.70 to 20.00 mm,
with Lactobacillus sakei being the most sensitive strain (13.50-20.00 mm). It
also effectively suppressed the growth of fungi isolated from corn grain silage
for up to 25 days and impaired morphology of colonies by likely affecting fungal 
membranes. These results point out that P. pentosaceus BLIS may be used as a new 
promising alternative to conventional antibacterial and antifungal substances,
with potential applications in agriculture and food industry as a natural
bio-controlling agent. Moreover, cytotoxicity and cell death induction tests
demonstrated cytotoxicity and toxicity of BLIS to human colon adenocarcinoma
Caco-2cells but not to peripheral blood mononuclear cells, with suggests possible
applications of BLIS also in medical-pharmaceutical applications.
