Paenibacillus polymyxa DSM 292 was originally isolated from soil in 1947 due to
its ability to produce antibiotics. The low proteolytic properties of strain DSM 
292 warrant its examination as a host for heterologous protein production. Here, 
we report the draft genome sequence of DSM 292 as established by Illumina MiSeq
paired-end sequencing.
