Unlike its biosynthetic mechanisms and physiological function, current
understanding of riboflavin degradation in soil is limited to a few bacteria that
decompose it to lumichrome. Here, we isolated six Microbacterium and three
Nocardioides strains. These strains utilized riboflavin and lumichrome,
respectively, as carbon sources. Among these strains, we identified
Microbacterium paraoxydans R16 (R16) and Nocardioides nitrophenolicus L16 (L16), 
which were isolated form the same enrichment culture. Co-cultured R16 and L16
reconstituted a riboflavin-degrading interspecies consortium, in which the R16
strain degraded riboflavin to lumichrome and á´…-ribose. The L16 strain utilized
the lumichrome as a carbon source, indicating that R16 is required for L16 to
grow in the consortium. Notably, rates of riboflavin degradation and growth were 
increased in co-cultured, compared with monocultured R16 cells. These results
indicated that a beneficial symbiotic interaction between M. paraoxydans R16 and 
N. nitrophenolicus L16 results in the ability to degrade riboflavin.
