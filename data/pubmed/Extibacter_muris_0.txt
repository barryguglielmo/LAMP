OBJECTIVES: Rodents play an important role to spread zoonotic diseases through
society. The current study was carried out to collect informative data on the
intestinal helminthic infections of wild rodents in Taleqan County, Alborz
Province, the center of Iran, emphasizing their zoonotic aspects.
RESULTS: Sixty-two killed rodents by local farmers belonging to five species were
collected, among which 24 were identified as Mus musculus, 15 as Meriones
persicus, 12 as Meriones libycus, 10 as Apodemus witherbyi, and 1 as Dryomys
nitedula. Of them, 30 (48.4%) were infected with at least one helminth species.
Rodents were infected with Hymenolepis diminuta (42%), Syphacia obvelata (21%),
Hymenolepis nana (17.7%), Heligmosomoides polygyrus (9.6%), Trichuris muris (8%),
and as well as a capillariid nematode that was isolated for the first time from
D. nitedula in Iran. The findings of the present study revealed a significant
intestinal helminthic infection of rodents in Taleqan County. Improving hygiene
practices, and making a preventive attitude can be helpful to reduce the hazards 
of rodent-borne diseases in the area where humans, livestock, and synanthropic
rodents are living close to each other.
