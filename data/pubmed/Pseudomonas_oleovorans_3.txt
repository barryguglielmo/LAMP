Strains of a Gram-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming bacterium,
designated MY50T, MY63 and MY101, were isolated from wound samples of three
hospitalized patients in Yangon, Myanmar. Strains MY50T, MY63 and MY101 grew at
temperatures of 4-44 °C, in media containing 1.0-7.0 % (w/v) NaCl and at pH
6.0-9.5. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene and whole genome sequences 
showed that these strains belonged to the genus Pseudomonas and were part of the 
Pseudomonas oleovorans group and located close to Pseudomonas guguanensis and
Pseudomonas mendocina. Whole-genome comparisons, using average nucleotide
identity and digital DNA-DNA hybridization analyses, confirmed that strains
MY50T, MY63 and MY101 were the same strain and they were a distinct species in
the P. oleovorans group. Results of phenotypic characterization tests
demonstrated that utilization of p-hydroxy-phenylacetic acid, glycerol,
l-pyroglutamic acid and quinic acid could distinguish these strains from other
species of the P. oleovorans group. These genetic and phenotypic characteristics 
suggest that they should be classified as representing a novel species, under the
proposed name Pseudomonas yangonensis sp. nov. The type strain is MY50T (=LMG
31602T,=JCM 33396T), with a DNA G+C content of 62.82 mol%.
