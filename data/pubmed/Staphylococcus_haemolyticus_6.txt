Vga(A) protein variants confer different levels of resistance to lincosamides,
streptogramins A and pleuromutilins (LSAP) by displacing antibiotics from the
ribosome. Here we show that expression of vga(A) variants from Staphylococcus
haemolyticus is regulated by cis-regulatory RNA in response to the LSAP
antibiotics by the mechanism of ribosome-mediated attenuation. The specificity of
induction depends on the Vga(A)-mediated resistance rather than on the sequence
of the riboregulator. Fine-tuning between Vga(A) activity and its expression in
response to the antibiotics may contribute to the selection of more potent Vga(A)
variants because newly acquired mutation can be immediately phenotypically
manifested.
