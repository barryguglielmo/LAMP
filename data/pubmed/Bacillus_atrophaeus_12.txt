The expression of β-lactamases is a major mechanism of bacterial resistance to
the β-lactam antibiotics. Four molecular classes of β-lactamases have been
described (A, B, C and D), however until recently the class D enzymes were
thought to exist only in Gram-negative bacteria. In the last few years, class D
enzymes have been discovered in several species of Gram-positive microorganisms, 
such as Bacillus and Clostridia, and an investigation of their kinetic and
structural properties has begun in earnest. Interestingly, it was observed that
some species of Bacillus produce two distinct class D β-lactamases, one highly
active and the other with only basal catalytic activity. Analysis of amino acid
sequences of active (BPU-1 from Bacillus pumilus) and inactive (BSU-2 from
Bacillus subtilis and BAT-2 from Bacillus atrophaeus) enzymes suggests that
presence of three additional amino acid residues in one of the surface loops of
inefficient β-lactamases may be responsible for their severely diminished
activity. Our structural and docking studies show that the elongated loop of
these enzymes severely restricts binding of substrates. Deletion of the three
residues from the loops of BSU-2 and BAT-2 β-lactamases relieves the steric
hindrance and results in a significant increase in the catalytic activity of the 
enzymes. These data show that this surface loop plays an important role in
modulation of the catalytic activity of Bacillus class D β-lactamases.
