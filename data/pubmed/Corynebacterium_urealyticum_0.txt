OBJECTIVES: Corynebacterium urealyticum is a non-diphtherial urease-producing
clinically relevant corynebacterium associated with urinary tract infections.
Most clinical C. urealyticum isolates are multidrug-resistant. Whole-genome
sequencing (WGS) of C. urealyticum VH4248 isolated from a clinical urine sample
at Hospital Universitario Marqués de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain, was performed 
to predict its antimicrobial resistance profile and to compare it with results of
culture-based phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
METHODS: Classical microbiological methods and VITEK® MS were used for isolation 
and initial identification of strain VH4248. Draft genome sequencing was
performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform, followed by assembly and annotation
using SPAdes and RAST. Resistance genes were identified through PATRIC, the
Pathosystems Resource Integration Center. Average nucleotide identity (ANI)
analysis was done using the EDGAR and OrthoANI databases. Antimicrobial
susceptibility was determined by Etest.
RESULTS: Isolate VH4248 was initially identified asC. urealyticum. Its genome
size is 2 261 231 bp with 64.4% GC content. Genome-based identification tools
showed an average 93.7% similarity between VH4248 and C. urealyticum genomes
deposited in public databases. Therefore, this isolate must be classified as
Corynebacterium sp. The blaA and ermX genes as well as a class 1 integron
including the aadB and sul1 genes are present in the VH4248 genome. This isolate 
is highly resistant to ampicillin, erythromycin and
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and moderately resistant to gentamicin and
kanamycin.
CONCLUSIONS: WGS is a powerful tool forCorynebacterium identification to species 
level and for detection of unusual resistance determinants, such as that encoded 
by the class 1 integron in isolate VH4248.
