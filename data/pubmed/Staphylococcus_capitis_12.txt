Microscopes are used in virtually every biological and medical laboratory.
Previous cultivation-based studies have suggested that direct contact with
microscope eyepieces increases the risk of eye infections. To obtain a deeper
insight into the microbiota on oculars, we analysed 10 recently used university
microscopes. Their left oculars were used for a cultivation-based approach, while
the right oculars served for massive gene sequencing. After cleaning with
isopropyl alcohol, the oculars were re-sampled and analysed again. All oculars
were found to be contaminated with bacteria, with a maximum load of 1.7 × 103 CFU
cm-2. MALDI Biotyping revealed mainly Cutibacterium (68%), Staphylococcus (14%)
and Brevibacterium (10%), with the most abundant species being Cutibacterium
acnes (13%) and Staphylococcus capitis (6%). Cleaning reduced the microbial load 
by up to 2 log scales. Within 10 uncleaned and 5 cleaned samples, 1480 ASVs were 
assigned to 10 phyla and 262 genera. The dominant genera before cleaning were
Cutibacterium (78%), Paracoccus (13%), Pseudomonas (2%) and Acinetobacter (1%).
The bacteriota composition on the cleaned oculars was similar; however, it
probably largely represented dead bacteria. In summary, used oculars were
significantly contaminated with skin and environmental bacteria, including
potential pathogens. Regular cleaning is highly recommended to prevent eye and
skin infections.
