Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease, and the
pathogenesis is still quite challenging. Emerging evidence has shown that the
brain-gut-microbiota axis served a pivotal role in neurological diseases;
however, researches utilizing metagenomic sequencing to analyze the alteration in
gut microbiota of MSA patients were quite rare. Here, we carried out metagenomic 
sequencing in feces of 15 MSA patients and 15 healthy controls, to characterize
the alterations in gut microbial composition and function of MSA patients in
mainland China. The results showed that gut microbial community of MSA patients
was significantly different from healthy controls, characterized by increased
genus Akkermansia and species Roseburia hominis, Akkermansia muciniphila,
Alistipes onderdonkii, Streptococcus parasanguinis, and Staphylococcus xylosus,
while decreased genera Megamonas, Bifidobacterium, Blautia, and Aggregatibacter
and species Bacteroides coprocola, Megamonas funiformis, Bifidobacterium
pseudocatenulatum, Clostridium nexile, Bacteroides plebeius, and Granulicatella
adiacens. Further, functional analysis based on the KEGG database revealed
aberrant functional pathways in fecal microbiome of MSA patients. In conclusion, 
our findings provided evidence for dysbiosis in gut microbiota of Chinese MSA
cohorts and helped develop new testable hypotheses on pathophysiology of MSA.
