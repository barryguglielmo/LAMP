Upland rice is an ecotype crop resulting from the long-term domestication and
evolution of rice in dry land without a water layer. Generally, the stems and
leaves are thick and luxuriant, while the leaves also typically broad and light. 
The root system is developed with abundant root hair, and the osmotic pressure of
the root and cell juice concentration in the leaves is high, while this plant is 
drought-resistant, heat-resistant, and water absorbent. This study aims to reveal
the "core flora" of the endophytes in upland rice seeds by examining their
diversity and community structures. It further intends to reveal the impact of
the soil environment on the formation of endophyte community structures in upland
rice seeds by comparing the environmental soil microorganisms in upland rice
habitats. In this study, high-throughput sequencing technology based on the
Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform was used to investigate the structure and diversity 
of endophytic bacterial communities using upland rice varieties collected from
different locations and soil samples from unified planting sites as materials.
Here, 42 endophytic OTUs were found to coexist in the 14 samples. At the phylum
level, the first dominant phyla in all the samples were Proteobacteria
(93.81-99.99%). At the genus level, Pantoea (8.77-87.77%), Pseudomonas
(1.15-61.58%), Methylobacterium (0.40-4.64%), Sphingomonas (0.26-3.85%),
Microbacterium (0.01-4.67%) and Aurantimonas (0.04-4.34%), which represent the
core microflora in upland rice seeds, served as the dominant genera that
coexisted in all the upland rice seeds tested. This study significant for the
isolation, screening, functional evaluation, and re-action of various functional 
microorganisms in upland rice to improve its agronomic traits. It also provides a
specific reference for the interaction between microorganisms and plants.
