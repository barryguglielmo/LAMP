Background: Shigella continues to be important causes of acute pediatric diarrhea
worldwide. Shigella produces numerous virulence factors involved in colonization 
and invasion into epithelial cells which eventually result in the disease. The
present study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of virulence genes and to 
investigate antibiotic resistance profiles among Shigella isolates obtained from 
pediatric patients in Iran.
Methods: A total of 141 Shigella isolates were collected between March 2017 and
September 2018 from stool of children under 14 who were suspected to have
shigellosis. Shigella isolates were identified using standard microbiological and
serological tests and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out via
Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. In addition, the presence of seven virulence
determinants including ipaH, ipaB, ipaC, ipaD, ipgD, sen, and virA were evaluated
using PCR.
Results: S. sonnei (78.7%) was the most prevalent shigella spp. among children
with shigellosis followed by S. flexneri (19.9%) and S. boydii (1.4%).
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that most of the isolates were
considered as multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains. Our findings also showed a high 
resistance rate against trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in Shigella isolates. The
prevalence of ipaH, ipaC, sen, ipaD, virA, ipaB, and ipgD were 100%, 95.7%,
95.7%, 94.3%, 93.6%, 92.9%, and 80.8%, respectively.
Conclusion: The current study revealed that S. sonnei was the predominant species
isolated from children with shigellosis in Iran. Our results also indicated a
high distribution of type III secretion system effector protein-encoding genes
and high multidrug-resistance among shigella spp. in Iran. Therefore, it is
suggested that antimicrobial susceptibility testing be performed prior to
antibiotic prescription.
