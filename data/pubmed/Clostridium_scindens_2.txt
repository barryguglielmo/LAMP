Vertebrates synthesize a diverse set of steroids and bile acids that undergo
bacterial biotransformations. The endocrine literature has principally focused on
the biochemistry and molecular biology of host synthesis and tissue-specific
metabolism of steroids. Host-associated microbiota possess a coevolved set of
steroid and bile acid modifying enzymes that match the majority of host
peripheral biotransformations in addition to unique capabilities. The set of
host-associated microbial genes encoding enzymes involved in steroid
transformations is known as the sterolbiome. This review focuses on the current
knowledge of the sterolbiome as well as its importance in medicine and
agriculture.
