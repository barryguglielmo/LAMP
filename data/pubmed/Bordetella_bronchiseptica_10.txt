Understudied, coinfections are more frequent in pig farms than single infections.
In pigs, the term "Porcine Respiratory Disease Complex" (PRDC) is often used to
describe coinfections involving viruses such as swine Influenza A Virus (swIAV), 
Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV), and Porcine
CircoVirus type 2 (PCV2) as well as bacteria like Actinobacillus
pleuropneumoniae, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Bordetella bronchiseptica. The
clinical outcome of the various coinfection or superinfection situations is
usually assessed in the studies while in most of cases there is no clear
elucidation of the fine mechanisms shaping the complex interactions occurring
between microorganisms. In this comprehensive review, we aimed at identifying the
studies dealing with coinfections or superinfections in the pig respiratory tract
and at presenting the interactions between pathogens and, when possible, the
mechanisms controlling them. Coinfections and superinfections involving viruses
and bacteria were considered while research articles including protozoan and
fungi were excluded. We discuss the main limitations complicating the
interpretation of coinfection/superinfection studies, and the high potential
perspectives in this fascinating research field, which is expecting to gain more 
and more interest in the next years for the obvious benefit of animal health.
