Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most common opportunistic pathogens that use
quorum sensing (QS) system to regulate virulence factors expression and biofilm
development. Delftia sp. 11304 was selected among 663 Gram-negative clinical
isolates based on its QS inhibitory activity against P. aeruginosa MMA83 clinical
isolate. Whole genome sequencing identified this isolate as D. tsuruhatensis and 
revealed genetic armamentarium of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance
determinants. Ethyl acetate extract of D. tsuruhatensis 11304 culture supernatant
(QSI extract) prevented biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa MMA83, but was unable 
to cause biofilm decomposition. QSI extract showed a synergistic effect in
combination with meropenem and gentamycin, against P. aeruginosa MMA83. A
dose-dependent reduction of the virulence factors: elastase, rhamnolipid and
pyocyanin production by P. aeruginosa MMA83 and significant downregulation of
lasI, lasR, rhlI, rhlR, pqs and mvfR expression were observed. Matrix-assisted
Laser Desorption Ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry of D. tsuruhatensis 11304
QSI extract revealed the presence of N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHL) with chain 
lengths of C12 to C18. The main ion peak was identified as
N-octadecanoylhomoserine lactone (C18-HSL). Commercial C18-HSL (20 µM) reduced
pyocyanin production as well as mRNA level of the lasI gene. A novel AHL species,
dihydroxy-N-octadecanoylhomoserine lactone, was also described.
