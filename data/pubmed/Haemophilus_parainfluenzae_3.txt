Background: Haemophilus parainfluenzae (H. parainfluenzae) is a gram-negative rod
that inhabits the oral cavity. It is a common cause of respiratory tract
infections and rarely is responsible for musculoskeletal infections in
immunocompetent hosts. We present a case of a 17-year-old male whose
postoperative course following arthroscopic all-inside meniscus repair was
complicated with H. parainfluenzae septic arthritis. The infection was
successfully cleared with two arthroscopic irrigation and debridements and
antibiotic therapy. The patient successfully returned to full-contact high school
football at five months postoperatively. To our knowledge, this represents the
first reported case of H. parainfluenzae infection following an orthopaedic
procedure in an adolescent. Level of Evidence: IV.
