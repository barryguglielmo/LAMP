Vagococcus lutrae belongs to the Vagococcus genus; it is possible to isolate
vagococci from marine hosts, contaminated food and soil. To our knowledge, this
is the first case of bloodstream infection with V. lutrae and only the second
reported human infection in the literature. As in the first reported case of
clinical infection with V. lutrae, this woman had several wounds. The clinical
investigation showed no other foci for the bloodstream infection, so we
hypothesize that the wounds were colonized, although they showed no signs of
infection and skin swabs did not reveal V. lutrae.
