Gardnerella vaginalis (G. vaginalis) is the major bacteria detected in women with
bacterial vaginosis (BV). Prevotella bivia (P. bivia) has been demonstrated to
show a symbiotic relationship with G. vaginalis. Some men have been shown to be
colonized with G. vaginalis in their urogenital or anorectal tracts, however
genitourinary infections in males, including balanitis and urethritis, due to
this organism appear to be much less common. In this report, we summarize
previous cases of men with G. vaginalis infection, and we present a rare and
unusual case of a unilateral scrotal abscess caused by G. vaginalis in
co-infection with P. bivia.
