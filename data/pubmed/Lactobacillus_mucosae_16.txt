The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial potential of
Lactobacillus screened from Tibetan yaks on clinical symptoms and intestinal
microflora in enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC) induced mice model. In vitro
study, Lactobacillus reuteri (LR1) exhibited stronger resistance to acid and bile
and inhibited the growth of EIEC than Lactobacillus mucosae (LM1). The mice were 
randomly divided into four groups i.e. the LR1 group (LR1 1 × 109 CFU/day), LM1
group (LM1 1 × 109 CFU/day), blank control group and control group. Mice in
control, LR1, and LM1 groups were challenged with EIEC on day 23. The body weight
in the control and LM1 groups were significantly decreased after the infection
with EIEC (P < 0.05), whereas the body weight of mice in the LR1 group did not
change significantly (P > 0.05). The lowest diarrhea rate was recorded in the LR1
group after infection with EIEC. The results showed that the number of pathogens 
in the control group was higher than that in the experimental groups. The
sequence analysis and OTU classification showed that the duodenum, ileum, and
cecum of mice in the LR1 group had the highest number of OTUs compared with other
groups. Whereas, the diversity analysis showed that in duodenum, ileum and cecum 
of mice in the LR1 group had the highest abundance and diversity. The composition
of intestinal microbes indicated the presence of high proportions of Firmicutes, 
Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Heat map analysis indicated high abundance of
Bdello vibrio in the duodenum of mice in the LR1 group, while many pathogens were
found in the different part of intestines in the control group, such as
Streptococcus, Clostridium and Pseudomonas. In conclusion, pre-supplementation of
LR1 alleviate the clinical symptoms caused by E. coli, and promote a healthy gut 
flora.
