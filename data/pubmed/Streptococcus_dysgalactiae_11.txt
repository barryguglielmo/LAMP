Infective endocarditis is a rare disease and is associated with a high mortality 
rate. The following case describes a 56-year-old gentleman who presented to our
hospital with a pulseless left leg concerning for acute limb ischemia, which was 
managed with emergent revascularization. His subsequent workup revealed IE due to
a rare organism known as Streptococcus dysgalactiae. Through this case, we want
to showcase this rare cause of IE and also highlight systemic embolization as its
possible initial presentation.
