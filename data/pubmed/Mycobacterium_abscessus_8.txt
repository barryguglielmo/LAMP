Mycobacterium abscessus belongs to a group of rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) 
and accounts for approximately 65-80% of lung disease caused by RGM. It is highly
pathogenic and is considered the prominent Mycobacterium involved in pulmonary
infection in patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic pulmonary disease (CPD).
FosM is a putative 134 amino acid fosfomycin resistance enzyme from M. abscessus 
subsp. bolletii that shares approximately 30-55% sequence identity with other
vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) fosfomycin resistance enzymes and represents the
first of its type found in any Mycobacterium species. Genes encoding VOC
fosfomycin resistance enzymes have been found in both Gram-positive and
Gram-negative pathogens. Given that FosA enzymes from Gram-negative bacteria have
evolved optimum activity towards glutathione (GSH) and FosB enzymes from
Gram-positive bacteria have evolved optimum activity towards bacillithiol (BSH), 
it was originally suggested that FosM might represent a fourth class of enzyme
that has evolved to utilize mycothiol (MSH). However, a sequence similarity
network (SSN) analysis identifies FosM as a member of the FosX subfamily,
indicating that it may utilize water as a substrate. Here we have synthesized MSH
and characterized FosM with respect to divalent metal ion activation and
nucleophile selectivity. Our results indicate that FosM is a Mn2+-dependent
FosX-type hydrase with no selectivity toward MSH or other thiols as analyzed by
NMR and mass spectroscopy.
