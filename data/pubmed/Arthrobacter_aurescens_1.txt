Human O-phosphoethanolamine phospho-lyase (hEtnppl; EC 4.2.3.2) is a pyridoxal
5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of
O-phosphoethanolamine (PEA) into acetaldehyde, phosphate and ammonia.
Physiologically, the enzyme is involved in phospholipid metabolism, as PEA is the
precursor of phosphatidylethanolamine in the CDP-ethanolamine (Kennedy) pathway. 
Here, the crystal structure of hEtnppl in complex with pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate 
was determined at 2.05 Å resolution by molecular replacement using the structure 
of A1RDF1 from Arthrobacter aurescens TC1 (PDB entry 5g4i) as the search model.
Structural analysis reveals that the two proteins share the same general fold and
a similar arrangement of active-site residues. These results provide novel and
useful information for the complete characterization of the human enzyme.
