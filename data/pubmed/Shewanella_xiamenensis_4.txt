A new variant of the blaOXA-546 gene, namely blaOXA-894, was identified on the
chromosome of Shewanella xiamenensis isolated from pig wastewater in rural China.
OXA-894 differs from OXA-546 (A46V, I219del) and OXA-48 (T167I, I219del) with two
amino acid substitutions, respectively. The isolate was resistant to ampicillin, 
aztreonam, imipenem, meropenem and fosfomycin. Carba NP test confirmed S.
xiamenensis strain sx20 as a carbapenemase-producer. The blaOXA-894 gene was
located between the gene encoding a LysR family transcriptional regulator and the
C15 gene. Its gene environment was similar to other S. xiamenensis with
chromosome-located blaOXA-48-like genes. The T24H and T94V amino acid
substitutions of LuxS protein were predicted to be deleterious, which may affect 
the virulence phenotype. The occurrence and potential health risk of
carbapenem-resistant S. xiamenensis in a water environment is of concern.
