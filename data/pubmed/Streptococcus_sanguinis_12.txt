Araticum is an edible and appreciable fruit of Annona coriacea, which is
popularly known as a traditional herb in the Brazilian cerrado. A phytochemical
study from the leaves of A. coriacea showed that HPLC-ESI-Q-Orbitrap® provided
through PRM experiments (MS2) is an efficient method for the fast and accurate
analysis of a complex mixture of annonaceous acetogenins, with the identification
of sylvaticin and gigantetrocin-A type acetogenins for the first time. In
addition, the crude leaf extract and acetogenin-rich fractions were assayed
against Streptococcus mutans, S. mitis, S. sanguinis and S. salivarius strains,
which are usually related to oral infections.
