Over the last few years, marine environment was found to be a source of surplus
natural products and microorganisms with new bioactive secondary metabolites of
interest which can divulge nutritional and biological impact on the host. This
study aims to assess the possible, inherent and functional probiotic properties
of a novel probiotic strain Enterococcus durans F3 (E. durans F3) isolated from
the gut of fresh water fish Catla catla. Parameters for evaluating and describing
the probiotics described in FAD/WHO guidelines were followed. E. durans F3
demonstrated affirmative results including simulated bile, acid and gastric juice
tolerance with exhibited significant bactericidal effect against pathogens
Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella Typhi, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa. This can be due to the enterocin produced by E. durans F3 strain,
which was resolute by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 
(SDS-PAGE) gel with amplification of the anticipated fragment of a structural
gene; enterocin A, followed by antibiotic susceptibility assessment. Effective
antioxidant potentiality against α-diphenyl-α-picrylhydrazyl free radicals
including lipase, bile salt hydrolase activity with auto-aggregation and cell
surface hydrophobicity was similarly observed. Results are proving the
potentiality of E. durans F3, which can also be used as probiotic starter culture
in dairy industries for manufacturing new products that imparts health benefits
to the host. Finding the potent and novel probiotic strains will also satisfy the
current developing market demand for probiotics.
