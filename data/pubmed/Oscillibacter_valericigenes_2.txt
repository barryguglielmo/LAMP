A greater understanding of the rumen microbiota and its function may help find
new strategies to improve feed efficiency in cattle. This study aimed to
investigate whether the cattle breed affects specific ruminal taxonomic microbial
groups and functions associated with feed conversion ratio (FCR), using two
genetically related Angus breeds as a model. Total RNA was extracted from 24
rumen content samples collected from purebred Black and Red Angus bulls fed the
same forage diet and then subjected to metatranscriptomic analysis. Multivariate 
discriminant analysis (sparse partial least square discriminant analysis
(sPLS-DA)) and analysis of composition of microbiomes were conducted to identify 
microbial signatures characterizing Black and Red Angus cattle. Our analyses
revealed relationships among bacterial signatures, host breeds and FCR. Although 
Black and Red Angus are genetically similar, sPLS-DA detected 25 bacterial
species and 10 functions that differentiated the rumen microbial signatures
between those two breeds. In Black Angus, we identified bacterial taxa
Chitinophaga pinensis, Clostridium stercorarium and microbial functions with
large and small subunits ribosomal proteins L16 and S7 exhibiting a higher
abundance in the rumen microbiome. In Red Angus, nonetheless, we identified the
poorly characterized bacterial taxon Oscillibacter valericigenes with a higher
abundance and pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism. Analysis of
composition of microbiomes revealed that C. pinensis and C. stercorarium
exhibited a higher abundance in Black Angus compared to Red Angus associated with
FCR, suggesting that these bacterial species may play a key role in the feed
conversion efficiency of forage-fed bulls. This study highlights how the
discovery of signatures of bacterial taxa and their functions can be used to
harness the full potential of the rumen microbiome in Angus cattle.
