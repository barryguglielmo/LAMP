A temperate bacteriophage, IME1320_01, was induced by mitomycin C treatment from 
Corynebacterium striatum. This phage possesses a double-stranded DNA genome of
40,086 bp with a G+C content of 58%. A total of 53 putative open reading frames
(ORFs) were identified in its genome. BLASTn analysis revealed that IME1320_01
had the highest sequence similarity to Corynebacterium striatum strain 216, with 
a genome homology coverage of 44% and highest sequence identity of 95%. The
termini of the phage genome was non-redundant, with a 13-nt 3'-protruding
cohesive end. To the best of our knowledge, phage IME1320_01 is the first
inducible phage to be identified in Corynebacterium striatum.
