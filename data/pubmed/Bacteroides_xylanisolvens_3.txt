For normal gut and body function, the diet should contain variety of dietary
fibres. To elucidate the links between food intake, especially the variety of
dietary fibres, faecal microbiota, body mass index and content of blood lipids,
59 healthy subjects on common Estonian diet were enrolled. The dietary records
were analysed at nutrient level while seven categories of fibres were
characterised to differentiate variety of fibre profiles consumed. The data of
the high fibre (HF) intake (>15.1 g/1000 kcal) and the low fibre (LF) intake
(<9.4 g/1000 kcal) groups were comparatively evaluated. LF diets associated with 
Collinsella, Coprococcus and Dorea, and higher consumption of meat and white
flour products while HF diet with Roseburia, Bacteroides xylanisolvens and
Oxalobacter formigenes, and arabinoxylan and pectin rich cereals and vegetables. 
Based on the results, modulation of the colon microbiota can be suggested by
careful variation and enrichment of dietary fibre sources.
