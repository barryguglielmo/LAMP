Corynebacterium striatum is an emerging nosocomial pathogen capable of causing a 
variety of infections in immunocompromised and hospitalized patients. We describe
three cases of infection by C. striatum that were initially considered as
contamination. Clinical suspicion in the wake of predisposing factors and
accurate identification, using Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time
of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) were key to implicate this commensal
bacteria as a cause of infection.
