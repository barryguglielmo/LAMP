Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and fatal disease of unknown
etiology; however, apoptosis of lung alveolar epithelial cells plays a role in
disease progression. This intractable disease is associated with increased
abundance of Staphylococcus and Streptococcus in the lungs, yet their roles in
disease pathogenesis remain elusive. Here, we report that Staphylococcus
nepalensis releases corisin, a peptide conserved in diverse staphylococci, to
induce apoptosis of lung epithelial cells. The disease in mice exhibits acute
exacerbation after intrapulmonary instillation of corisin or after lung infection
with corisin-harboring S. nepalensis compared to untreated mice or mice infected 
with bacteria lacking corisin. Correspondingly, the lung corisin levels are
significantly increased in human IPF patients with acute exacerbation compared to
patients without disease exacerbation. Our results suggest that bacteria shedding
corisin are involved in acute exacerbation of IPF, yielding insights to the
molecular basis for the elevation of staphylococci in pulmonary fibrosis.
