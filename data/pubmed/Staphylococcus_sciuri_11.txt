Novel Co4S3/Co3O4 composite nanotubes were first time successfully synthesized
through the control of Na2S treatment of Co(CO3)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10 precursor and 
testified to having both oxidase-like and peroxidase-like catalytic activities.
Through nanoscale Kirkendall effect, acicular precursor was vulcanized to form
Co4S3/Co3O4 nanotubes (NTs). Co4S3/Co3O4 NTs exhibit great properties such as
smaller Km and higher Vmax than natural horseradish peroxidase, favorable
selectivity and ideal stability. Co4S3/Co3O4 NTs with promising biocompatibility 
can realize spectral sterilization towards Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus
sciuri in the presence of low level H2O2. It turned to be that superoxide anion
radical catalyzed by Co4S3/Co3O4 NTs not only oxidizes 3, 3', 5,
5'-tetramethylbenzidine in the catalytic process but also eliminates
gram-bacteria during sterilization. The successful synthesis of biofunctional
Co4S3/Co3O4 NTs can serve as significant applications of new energy and
environmental catalysis.
