16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that the type strain Brevibacterium
frigoritolerans DSM 8801T had the highest similarity (99.7%) with the reference
strain Bacillus simplex NBRC 15720T, followed by Bacillus muralis DSM 16288T
(99.6%), Bacillus butanolivorans DSM 18926T (99.5%), and Bacillus loiseleuriae
FJAT-27997T (97.9%). This relationship is confirmed by the phylogenetic analysis 
indicating that Bre. frigoritolerans DSM 8801T fell in the genus Bacillus group
and formed a clade with the closely related Bacillus species. Average nucleotide 
identity and in silico DNA-DNA hybridization (isDDH) values between strain DSM
8801T and the most closed reference strain Bac. simplex NBRC 15720T were both
much lower than species definition threshold values of 95% and 70%, respectively,
which indicated strain DSM 8801T should not be affiliated to one of the validly
named Bacillus species. The percentage of conserved protein (POCP) values between
the strain DSM 8801T and the type strains of the above species were 80.7%, 69.2%,
72.2%, 53.6%, and 50.0%, respectively, higher than the genus definition threshold
value of 50%. The main isoprenoid quinone of strain DSM 8801T was MK-7, the main 
polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and
phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE), and the major fatty acids were anteiso-C15:0 and 
iso-C15:0. On the basis of the phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, phylogenetic and
genomic characteristics, Bre. frigoritolerans DSM 8801T should belong to the
genus Bacillus, and be proposed to reclassify as Bacillus frigoritolerans comb.
nov., with the type strain DSM 8801T (=ATCC 25097T  = CCUG 43489T  = CIP
67.20T  = JCM 11681T).
