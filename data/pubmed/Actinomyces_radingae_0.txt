End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients are a commonly overlooked
immunocompromised population that places them at risk for rare infections. We
describe the case of a 78-year-old man with a history of ESKD managed with thrice
weekly in-center hemodialysis who had a prolonged episode of left elbow pain and 
drainage and was eventually found to have a skin and soft tissue infection from
Actinomyces radingae. We review the bacteriology of Actinomyces spp. and the
experiences of other providers who have treated actinomycosis in individuals with
ESKD. The anatomic sites and demographics of these individuals are heterogeneous,
but they all generally require a long antibiotic course with a beta-lactam and
portend to a good prognosis. High index of suspicion is needed to identify rare
and atypical infections in the ESKD population.
