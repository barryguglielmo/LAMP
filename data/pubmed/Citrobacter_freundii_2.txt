Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae are a major threat to global public
health. Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) is the most commonly identified
carbapenemase in the United States and is frequently found on mobile genetic
elements including plasmids, which can be horizontally transmitted between
bacteria of the same or different species. Here we describe the results of an
epidemiological investigation of KPC-producing bacteria at two healthcare
facilities. Using a combination of short-read and long-read whole-genome
sequencing, we identified an identical 44 kilobase plasmid carrying the bla KPC-2
gene in four bacterial isolates belonging to three different species (Citrobacter
freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli). The isolates in this
investigation were collected from patients who were epidemiologically linked in a
region in which KPC was uncommon, suggesting that the antibiotic resistance
plasmid was transmitted between these bacterial species. This investigation
highlights the importance of long-read sequencing in investigating the
relatedness of bacterial plasmids, and in elucidating potential plasmid-mediated 
outbreaks caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria.
