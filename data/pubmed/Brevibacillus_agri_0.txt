Laccases have emerged as environment-friendly multifaceted biocatalysts for
diverse biotechnological applications. Here, we isolated a high molecular weight 
(88 kDa) extremophilic laccase (LacT) from Brevibacillus agri, with the aim to
exploit its extreme characters in denim bleaching. LacT has been characterized as
a thermostable, acidophilic enzyme with high salt, organic solvent, and divalent 
metal tolerance properties. Denim bleaching efficiency of LacT was optimum at
pH 4.0 and appeared to be surpassing over other reported laccases. LacT also
exhibited remarkable efficacy in the decolorization of water-soluble health
hazardous azo-dyes, and thus transpired to be a promising bio-bleaching and dye
decolorizing agent.
