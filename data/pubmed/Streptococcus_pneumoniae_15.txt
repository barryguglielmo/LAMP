BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from patients with invasive
pneumococcal disease has been subjected to laboratory-based surveillance in Latin
American and Caribbean countries since 1993. Invasive pneumococcal diseases
remain a major cause of death and disability worldwide, particularly in children.
We therefore aimed to assess the direct effect of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines
(PCVs) on the distribution of pneumococcal serotypes causing invasive
pneumococcal disease in children younger than 5 years before and after PCV
introduction.
METHODS: We did a multicentre, retrospective observational study in eight
countries that had introduced PCV (ie, PCV countries) in the Latin American and
Caribbean region: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Mexico,
Paraguay, and Uruguay. Cuba and Venezuela were also included as non-PCV
countries. Isolate data for Streptococcus pneumoniae were obtained between 2006
and 2017 from children younger than 5 years with an invasive pneumococcal disease
from local laboratories or hospitals. Species' confirmation and capsular
serotyping were done by the respective national reference laboratories. Databases
from the Sistema Regional de Vacunas (SIREVA) participating countries were
managed and cleaned in a unified database using Microsoft Excel 2016 and the
program R (version 3.6.1). Analysis involved percentage change in vaccine
serotypes between pre-PCV and post-PCV periods and the annual reporting rate of
invasive pneumococcal diseases per 100 000 children younger than 5 years, which
was used as a population reference to calculate percentage vaccine type
reduction.
FINDINGS: Between 2006 and 2017, 12 269 isolates of invasive pneumococcal disease
were collected from children younger than 5 years in the ten Latin American and
Caribbean countries. The ten serotypes included in ten-valent pneumococcal
conjugate vaccine (PCV10) decreased significantly (p<0·0001) after any PCV
introduction, except for the Dominican Republic. The percentage change for the
ten vaccine serotypes in PCV10 countries was -91·6% in Brazil (530 [72·9%] of 727
before, 27 [6·1%] of 441 after); -85·0% in Chile (613 [72·6%] of 844 before, 44
[10·9%] of 404] after); -84·7% in Colombia (231 [63·1%] of 366 before, 34 [9·7%] 
of 352 after); and -73·8% in Paraguay (127 [77·0%] of 165 before, 22 [20·2%] of
109 after). In the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) countries,
the percentage change for the 13 vaccine serotypes was -59·6% in Argentina (853
[85·0%] of 1003 before, 149 [34·3%] of 434 after); -16·5% in the Dominican
Republic (95 [80·5%] of 118 before, 39 [67·2%] of 58 after); -43·7% in Mexico
(202 [73·2%] of 276 before, 63 [41·2%] of 153 after); and -45·9% in Uruguay (138 
[80·7%] of 171 before, 38 [43·7%] of 87 after). Annual reporting rates showed a
reduction from -82·5% (6·21 before vs 1·09 after per 100 000, 95% CI -61·6 to
-92·0) to -94·7% (1·15 vs 0·06 per 100 000, -89·7 to -97·3) for PCV10 countries, 
and -58·8% (2·98 vs 1·23 per 100 000, -21·4 to -78·4) to -82·9% (7·80 vs 1·33 per
100 000, -76·9 to -87·4) for PCV13 countries. An increase in the amount of
non-vaccine types was observed in the eight countries after PCV introduction
together with an increase in their percentage in relation to total invasive
strains in the post-PCV period.
INTERPRETATION: SIREVA laboratory surveillance was able to confirm the effect of 
PCV vaccine on serotypes causing invasive pneumococcal disease in the eight PCV
countries. Improved monitoring of the effect and trends in vaccine type as well
as in non-vaccine type isolates is needed, as this information will be relevant
for future decisions associated with new PCVs.
