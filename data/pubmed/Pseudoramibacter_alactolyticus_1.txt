INTRODUCTION: More than 1200 different types of microbes were found in the human 
mouth, only some of these microorganisms were associated with intracranial
bacterial infection. However, there are limited data available about the
Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus (P alactolyticus) or Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(MTB) intracranial infections oral origin.
PATIENT CONCERNS: Here, we reported a rarely case with P alactolyticus and MTB
coinfection in central nervous after dental extraction. The 44-year-old man
presented with progressive headache over the last 2 weeks and a sustained fever
>39Â°C, with a dental extraction performed 2 days before the onset of headache.
DIAGNOSIS: P alactolyticus and MTB were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain
reaction targeting the16S ribosomal RNA gene. The presence of MTB was also
demonstrated by positive acid-fast staining of the purulent discharge.
INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated by metronidazole and anti-TB treatment
OUTCOMES:: The patient fully recovered without sequela.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion there should be awareness of the possibility of P
alactolyticus or MTB intracranial infections following tooth extraction.
