The hypothesized link between gut bacteria and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has
been explored through animal models and human studies with microbiome assessment 
after ASD presentation. We aimed to prospectively characterize the association
between the infant/toddler gut microbiome and ASD-related social behaviors at age
3 years. As part of an ongoing birth cohort gut bacterial diversity, structure,
taxa, and function at 6 weeks (n = 166), 1 year (n = 158), 2 years (n = 129), and
3 years (n = 140) were quantified with 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomic
sequencing (n = 101 six weeks, n = 103 one year). ASD-related social behavior was
assessed at age 3 years using Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2) T-scores.
Covariate-adjusted linear and permutation-based models were implemented.
Microbiome structure at 1 year was associated with SRS-2 total T-scores
(p = 0.01). Several taxa at 1, 2, and 3 years were associated with SRS-2
performance, including many in the Lachnospiraceae family. Higher relative
abundance of Adlercreutzia equolifaciens and Ruminococcus torques at 1 year
related to poorer SRS-2 performance. Two functional pathways, L-ornithine and
vitamin B6 biosynthesis, were associated with better social skills at 3 years.
Our results support potential associations between early-childhood gut microbiome
and social behaviors. Future mechanistic studies are warranted to pinpoint
sensitive targets for intervention.
