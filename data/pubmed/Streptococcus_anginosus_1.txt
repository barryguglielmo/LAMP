This study updates dalbavancin activity against contemporary (2017-2019) isolates
of indicated species/groups (n = 16,451). Isolates from 71 hospitals were tested 
by broth microdilution method. All isolates were susceptible to dalbavancin.
Dalbavancin MIC50/90 values remained stable for Staphylococcus aureus,
vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis, β-hemolytic streptococci, and
Streptococcus anginosus group since its clinical approval.
