Two Haemophilus-like isolates with similar biochemical characteristics,
designated strains SZY H1T and SZY H2, were isolated from human semen specimens. 
Cells were Gram-negative, non-motile, non-acid-fast, pleomorphic rods or
coccobacilli. The major fatty acids (>10 %) were C16 : 0, C14 : 0, iso-C16 : 0
and/or C14 : 0 3-OH and C16 : 1 ω6c and/or C16 : 1 ω7c. The polar lipids were
determined to be phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, an unidentified 
phospholipid, an unidentified aminophospholipid, two unidentified polar lipids
and four unidentified aminolipids. The major polyamine was found to be
cadaverine. The near-full-length (1462 nt) 16S rRNA gene sequences analysis
showed the two isolates were nearly identical (>99.8 %), and closely matched
Haemophilus haemolyticus ATCC 33390T with 98.9-99.1 % sequence similarities.
Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences and concatenation of 30
protein markers also revealed that the isolates clustered together with H.
haemolyticus ATCC 33390T, and formed a distinct lineage well separated from the
other members of the genus Haemophilus. Further, the average nucleotide identity 
values between the two isolates and their related species were below the
established cut-off values for species delineation (95 %). Based on these
findings, the two isolates are considered to represent a new species of the genus
Haemophilus, for which name Haemophilus seminalis sp. nov. is proposed. The type 
strain is SZY H1T (=NBRC 113782T=CGMCC 1.17137T).
