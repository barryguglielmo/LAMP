PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The cause of bacterial vaginosis, the most common cause of
vaginal discharge in women, remains controversial. We recently published an
updated conceptual model on bacterial vaginosis pathogenesis, focusing on the
roles of Gardnerella vaginalis and Prevotella bivia as early colonizers and
Atopobium vaginae and other bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria (BVAB) as
secondary colonizers in this infection. In this article, we extend the
description of our model to include a discussion on the role of host-vaginal
microbiota interactions in bacterial vaginosis pathogenesis.
RECENT FINDINGS: Although G. vaginalis and P. bivia are highly abundant in women 
with bacterial vaginosis, neither induce a robust inflammatory response from
vaginal epithelial cells. These early colonizers may be evading the immune system
while establishing the bacterial vaginosis biofilm. Secondary colonizers,
including A. vaginae, Sneathia spp., and potentially other BVAB are more potent
stimulators of the host-immune response to bacterial vaginosis and likely
contribute to its signs and symptoms as well as its adverse outcomes.
SUMMARY: Elucidating the cause of bacterial vaginosis has important implications 
for diagnosis and treatment. Our current bacterial vaginosis pathogenesis model
provides a framework for key elements that should be considered when designing
and testing novel bacterial vaginosis diagnostics and therapeutics.
