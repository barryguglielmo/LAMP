Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as one of the most lethal drug-resistant
bacteria in recent years. We report the synthesis and antimicrobial studies of 25
new pyrazole-derived hydrazones. Some of these molecules are potent and specific 
inhibitors of A. baumannii strains with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 
value as low as 0.78 Âµg/mL. These compounds are non-toxic to mammalian cell lines
in in vitro studies. Furthermore, one of the potent molecules has been studied
for possible in vivo toxicity in the mouse model and found to be non-toxic based 
on the effect on 14 physiological blood markers of organ injury.
