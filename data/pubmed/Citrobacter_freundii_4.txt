OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to screen for the presence of
β-lactamases-producing Gram negative bacteria isolates from Algerian currency
collected from food vendors in Batna city, Algeria.
METHODS: During two periods, May 2018 and from March to April 2019, a total of
408 coins and notes currency of different denominations of Algerian Dinar were
randomly recovered from some food vendors. Samples were subjected to selective
isolation of extended spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenem resistant Gram
negative bacteria. The bacterial species identification was performed using
Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry.
Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using the disk-diffusion method. 
Carbapenemases and extended-spectrum β-lactamases genes were searched for by
Real-time PCR, Standard PCR and sequencing. The clonality relationships of
carbapenemase producing isolates were investigated by multilocus sequence typing.
The transferability of the detected carbapenemase encoding gene was verified by
conjugation experiments.
RESULTS: A total of twelve cefotaxime and/or carbapenem-resistant strains were
isolated in this study and identified as E. cloacae, Raoultella ornithinolytica, 
Citrobacter freundii, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Pseudomonas libanensis and
Pseudomonas stutzeri. The blaOXA-48 gene was detected in only one E. cloacae
strain belonging to the ST108, while the two Raoultella ornithinolytica isolates 
harboured the blaCTX-M-27 gene and one E. coli strain carried the blaCTX-M-14
gene. The detected blaOXA-48 gene was transferable by conjugation.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we report for the first time, the detection of
OXA-48-producing Enterobacter cloacae isolate from money. Thus, it calls for
consciousness development on the potential risks associated with poor handling of
currency.
