Primarily formed by the microbial decarboxylation of the amino acid histidine,
histamine is the leading global cause of food poisoning from fish consumption
worldwide. In the present work, the quality of 12 fresh and 12 frozen marketed
sardines (Sardinella brasiliensis) were evaluated for histamine concentration
using High-performance Liquid Chromatography with Diode-Array Detection
(HPLC-DAD), while the detection and quantification of histamine-producing
bacteria were performed via quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR), and
the microbiota composition of sardines was assessed through amplification of the 
16S rRNA gene using high-throughput sequencing (HTS). According to the results
obtained by HPLC-DAD, histamine concentration ranged from 226.14 to 583.87 mg
kg-1. The histidine decarboxylase (hdc) genes from gram-negative bacteria
(Morganella morganii, and Enterobacter aerogenes) were identified. The most
abundant microorganisms present in fresh sardines belong to the genera
Macrococcus spp., Acinetobacter spp., and Pseudomonas spp., while the genera
Phyllobacterium spp., Pseudomonas spp., and Acinetobacter spp. were most abundant
in frozen sardines.
