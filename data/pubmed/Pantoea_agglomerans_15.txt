Plant-associated microbes influence plant performance and may also impact biotic 
and abiotic stress tolerance. The microbiome of mulberry trees planted for
ecological restoration in the hydro-fluctuation belt of the Three Gorges
Reservoir Region, China exhibited distinct patterns of localization. The
endosphere exhibited lower Î±-diversity relative to the rhizosphere, but was more 
closely-related to host growth status, especially in stem tissues. Pantoea was
the predominant bacterial genus inhabiting the stems of two well-growing plants, 
while sequences identified as Pseudomonas and Pantoea were abundant in
poorly-growing plants. The complexity of the endophytic community was more
connected to growth status in well-growing plants than it was in poorly-growing
plants. Among 151 endophytes cultured from collected samples of mulberry, 64
exhibited plant growth-promoting (PGP) potential in vitro and the majority of
beneficial taxa were harvested from well-growing plants. Collectively, the
present study indicates that the recruitment of beneficial endophytes may
contribute to mulberry fitness under abiotic stress, and it provides a foundation
for the development of a new strategy in vegetation restoration. This article is
