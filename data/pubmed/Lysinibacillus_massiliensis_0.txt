The reductive pyrimidine catabolic pathway is the most widespread pathway for
pyrimidine degradation in bacteria, enabling assimilation of nitrogen for growth.
This pathway, which has been studied in several bacteria including Escherichia
coli B, releases only one utilizable nitrogen atom from each molecule of uracil, 
whereas the other nitrogen atom remains trapped in the end product β-alanine.
Here, we report the biochemical characterization of a β-alanine:2-oxoglutarate
aminotransferase (PydD) and an NAD(P)H-dependent malonic semialdehyde reductase
(PydE) from a pyrimidine degradation gene cluster in the bacterium Lysinibacillus
massiliensis Together, these two enzymes converted β-alanine into
3-hydroxypropionate (3-HP) and generated glutamate, thereby making the second
nitrogen from the pyrimidine ring available for assimilation. Using
bioinformatics analyses, we found that PydDE homologs are associated with
reductive pyrimidine pathway genes in many Gram-positive bacteria in the classes 
Bacilli and Clostridia. We demonstrate that Bacillus smithii grows in a defined
medium with uracil or uridine as its sole nitrogen source and detected the
accumulation of 3-HP as a waste product. Our findings extend the reductive
pyrimidine catabolic pathway and expand the diversity of enzymes involved in
bacterial pyrimidine degradation.
