Positive effects of fermented foods consumption on humans have stimulated lots of
research attention. In this study, we investigated the probiotic potentials,
antagonistic activities, and safety properties of Lactobacillus brevis gp104
isolated from Iranian traditional cheese. The results showed that the strain had 
high resistance to acidic conditions, simulated gastric and intestinal fluid. L. 
brevis gp104 was able to assimilate cholesterol from the medium; 41% in medium
without bile salts and 58% in medium with bile salts. The potential of this
strain was relatively low in phytate hydrolyzation and 62.02% hydrophobicity,
40.2% auto-aggregation, and 48.3% co-aggregation were observed. The adhesion
value of L. brevis gp104 to adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells was 13.4% that was also
confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Antibacterial effect of L.
brevis fg104 was imposed against pathogenic strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa PTCC 1707, Salmonella typhimurium PTCC 1609, and
Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923) and the most sensitive strain S. aureus. L.
brevis gp104 was able to compete (52%), inhibit (47%) and displace (21%) the
adhesion of S. aureus to Caco-2 cells. L. brevis gp104 did not show haemolytic or
DNase activity, which confirms its safety aspects. Therefore, L. brevis gp104 was
demonstrated promising properties for its potential health benefits for its
application as novel bio-therapeutic and bio-preservation agents.
