In this work, a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor has been fabricated
using immunoassay for sensitive determination of Bifidobacterium bifidum. Au
nanoparticle has been used for amplifying sandwich assays. The proposed
immunosensor exhibited a linear detection range between 103 and 105 CFU/mL with a
limit of detection of 2.1 × 102 CFU/mL. The proposed immunosensor exhibited good 
selectivity for B. bifidum sensing with low cross reactivity for other foodborne 
pathogens such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, Listeria monocytogenes, and
Escherichia coli. In addition, the proposed immunosensor has been successfully
used for B. bifidum detection in feces samples and food samples. The frequency
decreases of 12, 17, and 10 Hz were observed from the milk samples consisting of 
the mixtures of L. acidophilus, L. monocytogenes, and E. coli. The frequency
decreases of 8, 15, and 7 Hz were observed from the feces samples consisting of
the mixtures of L. acidophilus, L. monocytogenes, and E. coli.
