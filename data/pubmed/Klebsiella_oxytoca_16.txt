The enantiomers of (4R/S)-4-hydroxy-N, N-diphenyl-2-pentynamide are key chiral
synthons for the synthesis of thrombin receptor antagonists such as vorapaxar. In
this paper, we report the enzymatic preparation of enantiomerically enriched
(4R)-4-hydroxy-N, N-diphenyl-2-pentynamide using lipase A from Burkholderia
cepacia ATCC 25416 as the catalyst. First, the lipase gene (lipA) and its
chaperone gene (lipB) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli system. After 
purification, lipase A activation was performed with the assistance of foldase
lipase B. Enzyme assay revealed that the activated lipase A showed the optimal
catalytic activity at 60 ºC and pH 7. The effects of various metals on the
activity were investigated and results demonstrated that most of the metals
inhibited the activity. To further improve the catalytic outcome, two-phase
reaction was studied, and n-hexane proved to be a good organic solvent for the
combination system. Using the optimize conditions, (4R)-4-hydroxy-N,
N-diphenyl-2-pentynamide with 94.5% ee value and 48.93% conversion ratio was
achieved. Our investigation on this lipase reveals lipase A as a promising
biocatalyst for producing chiral propargyl alcohol for preparation of novel
himbacine analogs.
