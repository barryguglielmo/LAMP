INTRODUCTION: To prevent gastric cancer, it is important to accurately determine 
the presence of Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection. However, correctly
identifying HP-uninfected individuals is difficult when using the combination of 
HP antibody and pepsinogen (PG).
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to discriminate true HP-uninfected
individuals from others without the need for endoscopic examination.
METHODS: A total of 684 subjects with no history of HP eradication who underwent 
a medical checkup at our hospital were enrolled. The "true uninfected
individuals" were determined by a negative stool antigen test and no endoscopic
findings of HP-associated gastritis. HP antibody was measured by the latex
immunoassay method. Logistic regression analysis using a combination of
noninvasive parameters was performed to develop a formula for predicting true
uninfected individuals.
RESULTS: A total of 528 subjects were classified as true uninfected individuals. 
Logistic regression analysis showed that statistically significant factors for
true uninfected individuals were age (p < 0.001), HP antibody (p <0.001), PGI (p 
<0.001), and PGII (p = 0.012). The areas under the curve (AUCs) for true
uninfected individuals were the highest (0.944) upon applying the prediction
formula including four parameters: age, HP antibody, PGI, and PGII. Both the
sensitivity and the specificity of the four-parameter prediction formula were
higher than those of the traditional three-parameter model using HP antibody,
PGI, and PGI/II ratio (sensitivity: 93.2% vs. 86.6% and specificity: 88.5% vs.
82.7%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a model with a combination of four
noninvasive parameters is useful for predicting true HP-uninfected individuals
without the need for endoscopic examination.
