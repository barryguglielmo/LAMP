INTRODUCTION: The higher frequency of infections in diabetic patients is caused
by a hyperglycemic environment, which promotes immune dysfunction. People with
diabetes are more prone to skin infections. A continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)
system provides information on changes in blood glucose (BG) levels throughout
the day. Its use facilitates optimal therapeutic decisions for a diabetic
patient. One of the factors limiting the use of CGM is inflammation at the
insertion site.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study was the microbiological identification of 
the bacterial strains which are found on CGM sensor electrodes.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed microbiological tests on patients' CGM Enlite 
Medtronic electrodes, which were removed after 6 days of usage according to the
manufacturer's instructions. 31 sensors were examined from 31 children (14 girls)
aged from 0.5 to 14.6 years. The microbiological analysis was routinely performed
at the Department of Children's Diabetology Medical University of Silesia in
Katowice, Poland.
RESULTS: 12 (39%) of the electrodes were colonized. In 11 (92%) cases the
electrodes were colonized by one bacteria strain. 7 times methicillin-sensitive
coagulase negative staphylococcus (MSCNS) was detected. We also found one case of
Klebsiella pneumoniae, Ochrobactrum tritici, Bacillus sonorensis and
methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci (MRCNS) colonization. One 
electrode was colonized by the mixed flora Enterococcus faecalis,
methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative Staphylococci (MSCNS), Pseudomonas
stutzeri, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The median HbA1c 
in the group with colonization of electrodes was 6, 85% (6, 3-7, 6%) versus 6, 3%
(5, 8-7, 5%) in the group without colonization. The median BMI in the group with 
colonization of the electrodes was 17.10 kg/m2 (16.28-18.62 kg/m2) versus
15.98 kg/m2 (15.14-17.96 kg/m2) in the group without colonization. Statistically,
significantly more frequently electrodes are colonized in older children (median 
age in the group with colonization of electrodes 11.43 years (6.52-12.27 years), 
without colonization 8.42 years. (3.098-9.375 years); (p = 0.033).
CONCLUSIONS: It seems that older children are more likely to have their sensor
electrode colonized by bacterial strains.
