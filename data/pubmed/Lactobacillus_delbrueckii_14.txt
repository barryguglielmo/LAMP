The reformulation of dairy products to contain less added sugar can contribute to
reducing sugar consumption, thereby reducing the risk of non-communicable
diseases. The objective of this study was to investigate the microbial ecology of
reformulated yoghurt, which was produced using bi-enzymatic modification of
lactose to increase its sweetness by a factor of 2-3. Ultimately, this
reformulation strategy could reduce the amount of added sugar needed for equal
sweetness of the end product. The bi-enzymatic modification relied on utilisation
of a Î²-galactosidase enzyme to convert the milk sugar lactose to galactose and
glucose, followed by the enzymatic conversion of the glucose moiety to fructose
using a glucose isomerase. The microbial ecology of reformulated yoghurt produced
with two mixed starter culture preparations containing either Streptococcus (S.) 
thermophilus and Lactobacillus (Lb.) delbrueckii or S. thermophilus, Lb.
acidophilus and Bifidobacterium sp. strains, was analysed during fermentation and
cool storage using 16S rRNA based metagenomics. None of the yoghurt samples
showed a significant difference in microbial composition between
sweetness-enhanced and regular milk at all sampling time points during
manufacture and storage of yoghurt. However, a significant difference between the
microbiota of inoculated milk before and after fermentation was observed. In both
types of yoghurt, the starter culture genera dominated the microbial ecology at
the end of fermentation as expected, reducing the possibility of growth of
potentially pathogenic or spoilage bacteria possibly resulting from a changed
carbohydrate spectrum.
