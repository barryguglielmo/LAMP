Inter-subject variability in human milk microbiome is well known; however, its
origins and possible relationship to the mother's diet are still debated. We
investigated associations between maternal nutrition, milk fatty acids
composition and microbiomes in mother-infant dyads. Breast milk and infant fecal 
samples were collected across three time points (one week, one month and three
months postpartum) from 22 mother-infant pairs. Food frequency questionnaires for
the months of pregnancy and three months postpartum were collected. Milk fatty
acids were analyzed by GC-MS and the microbiome in breast milk and infant feces
was determined by 16S rRNA sequencing. Statistical interactions were computed
using Spearman's method and corrected for multiple comparisons. We found
significant negative correlation between Streptococcus relative abundance in
maternal milk and intake of unsaturated fatty acids and folic acid at one month
postpartum. At three months postpartum, vitamin B-12 consumption was
significantly associated with a single operational taxonomic unit belonging to
Streptococcus. Comparison between milk microbiome and lipid composition showed,
one-month postpartum, significant negative correlation between Streptococcus
relative abundance and the abundance of oleic acid. Additional correlations were 
detected between Staphylococcus hominis and two medium-chain saturated fatty
acids. Our results reinforce the hypothesis that maternal nutrition may affect
milk microbiome.
