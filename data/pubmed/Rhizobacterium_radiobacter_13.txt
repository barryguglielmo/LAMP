In this study, we explored the pathogenicity and phylogenetic position of
Agrobacterium spp. strains isolated from crown gall tissues on annual, perennial,
and ornamental plants in Iran. Of the 43 strains studied, 10 strains were
identified as Allorhizobium vitis (formerly Agrobacterium vitis) using the
species-specific primer pair PGF/PGR. Thirty-three remaining strains were studied
using multilocus sequence analysis of four housekeeping genes (i.e., atpD, gyrB, 
recA, and rpoB), from which seven strains were identified as A. larrymoorei and
one strain was identified as A. rubi (Rer); the remaining 25 strains were
scattered within the A. tumefaciens species complex. Two strains were identified 
as genomospecies 1 (G1), seven strains were identified as A. radiobacter (G4),
seven strains were identified as A. deltaense (G7), two strains were identified
as A. nepotum (G14), and one strain was identified as "A. viscosum" (G15). The
strains Rnr, Rnw, and Rew as well as the two strains OT33 and R13 all isolated
from rose and the strain Ap1 isolated from apple were clustered in three atypical
clades within the A. tumefaciens species complex. All but eight strains (i.e.,
Nec10, Ph38, Ph49, fic9, Fic72, R13, OT33, and Ap1) were pathogenic on tomato and
sunflower seedlings in greenhouse conditions, whereas all but three strains
(i.e., fic9, Fic72, and OT33) showed tumorigenicity on carrot root discs. The
phylogenetic analysis and nucleotide diversity statistics suggested the existence
of two novel genomospecies within the A. tumefaciens species complex, which we
named "G19" and "G20." Hence, we propose the strains Rew, Rnw, and Rnr as the
members of "G19" and the strains R13 and OT33 as the members of G20, whereas the 
phylogenetic status of the atypical strain Ap1 remains undetermined.
