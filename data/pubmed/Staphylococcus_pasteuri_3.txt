Due to the ecological toxicity and environmental residues, how to remove the
persistent organic pollutants (POPs), especially of
polycyclic-aromatic-hydrocarbons (PAHs) and dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethanes
(DDTs), from agricultural soil has captured the attention of scholars for a long 
time. To develop an effective and low-cost in situ co-remediation technique, five
independent but complementary treatments were used on an over-standard PAHs-DDTs 
co-contaminated soil in an agricultural greenhouse. Experimental results
identified that the combination of microbe (Bacillus methylotrophicus) - plant
(Brassica rapa) could remove rhamnolipid activated PAHs and DDTs effectively
after enhanced by Staphylococcus pasteuri. Also, the Benzoapyrene and total DDTs 
residue in Brassica rapa was up to the standard of National (China) food safety. 
The lignin enhanced the removal of high-rings PAHs and p-p' DDE but reduced soil 
microbial biomass carbon and soil enzymes activity (polyphenol oxidase, invertase
and acid phosphatase). Pearson correlation analysis showed that polyphenol
oxidase activity was significantly related to the PAHs/DDTs dissipation rate. Our
research suggested a new amendment that could remediate PAHs/DDTs co-contaminated
agricultural soil without interrupting crop production, and the polyphenol
oxidase activity should be considered as a micro-ecological indicator in this
process.
