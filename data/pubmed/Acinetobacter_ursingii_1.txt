We sought to evidence the presence of emerging bacterial pathogens in clothes
lice collected from sheltered homeless individuals from Marseille, France. During
the 2013-2018 period, a total of 507 lice were collected from 37 individuals and 
were processed for molecular analysis. We reported a low prevalence of Bartonella
quintana DNA carriage (1.2%). No louse tested positive for Rickettsia sp.,
Rickettsia prowazekii, Borrelia sp., Anaplasma sp., Yersinia Pestis, or Coxiella 
burnetii. A comparison with studies conducted before 2013 showed a 17.5-fold
reduction in the rate of B. quintana DNA positivity. By contrast, a high
prevalence of Acinetobacter species DNA carriage (40.8%), mostly A. baumannii
(32.9%), was observed, tending to increase over time. In addition, we detected
Acinetobacter ursingii DNA in clothes lice for the first time. Genotypic
characterization and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of A. baumannii
isolates from clothes lice are needed to assess whether these A. baumannii
strains present in lice are similar to those responsible for human infections and
harbor mechanisms of resistance against antibiotics.
