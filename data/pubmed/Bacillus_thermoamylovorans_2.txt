Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas12b is a
newly emerged genome engineering system. Here, we compared Cas12b from
Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris (Aac), Alicyclobacillus acidiphilus (Aa),
Bacillus thermoamylovorans (Bth) and Bacillus hisashii (Bh) for genome
engineering in rice, an important crop. We found AaCas12b was more efficient than
AacCas12b and BthCas12b for targeted mutagenesis, which was further demonstrated 
in multiplexed genome editing. We also engineered the Cas12b systems for targeted
transcriptional repression and activation. Our work establishes Cas12b as the
third promising CRISPR system, after Cas9 and Cas12a, for plant genome
engineering.
