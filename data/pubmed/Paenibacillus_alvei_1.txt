OBJECTIVE: A Paenibacillus strain isolated in previous research exhibited
antimicrobial activity against relevant human pathogens including Staphylococcus 
aureus and Listeria monocytogenes. In this study, the genome of the
aforementioned strain, designated as MP1, was shotgun sequenced. The draft genome
of strain MP1 was subject to multiple genomic analyses to taxonomically
characterize it and identify the genes potentially responsible for its
antimicrobial activity.
RESULTS: Here we report the draft genome sequence of an antimicrobial producing
Paenibacillus strain, MP1. Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) analysis established
strain MP1 as a new strain of the previously characterized Paenibacillus alvei.
The genomic analysis identified several putative secondary metabolite clusters
including seven Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase clusters (NRPS) (> 10,000 nt),
one bacteriocin or other unspecified Ribosomally Synthesized and
Post-Translationally modified Peptide Product (RiPP), one lanthipeptide, and six 
hybrid clusters (NRPS-Type I Polyketide synthase (T1PKS) and NRPS-trans Amino
Transferase Polyketide Synthase (AT-PKS)).
