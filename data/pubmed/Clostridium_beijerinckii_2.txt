This study addressed the functionality of genetic circuits carrying natural
regulatory elements of Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 in the presence of the
respective inducer molecules. Specifically, promoters and their regulators
involved in diverse carbon source utilization were characterized using mCherryOpt
or beta-galactosidase as a reporter. Consequently, most of the genetic circuits
tested in this study were functional in Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 in
the presence of an inducer, leading to the expression of reporter proteins. These
genetic sensor-regulators were found to be transferable to another Clostridium
species, such as Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052. The gradual expression of
reporter protein was observed as a function of the carbohydrates of interest. A
xylose-inducible promoter allows a titratable and robust expression of a reporter
protein with stringency and efficacy. This xylose-inducible circuit was seen to
enable induction of the expression of reporter proteins in the presence of actual
sugar mixtures incorporated in woody hydrolysate wherein glucose and xylose are
present as predominant carbon sources.
