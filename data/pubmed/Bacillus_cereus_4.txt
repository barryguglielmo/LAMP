YmdB, which can regulate biofilm formation independently, has been reported to
exist in Bacillus subtilis. The B. cereus 0-9 genome also encodes a YmdB-like
protein, which has measureable phosphodiesterase activity, and 72.35% sequence
identity to YmdB protein of B. subtilis 168. In this work, we studied the
function of YmdB protein and its encoding gene, ymdB, in B. cereus 0-9. Our
results indicated that YmdB protein is critical for the biofilm formation of B.
cereus 0-9. In Î”ymdB mutant, the transcriptional levels of sinR and hag were
up-regulated, and those of genes closely related to biofilm formation, such as
sipW, tasA and calY, were down-regulated. Deletion of ymdB gene stimulates the
swarming motility of B. cereus 0-9, and enhances it to travel outward, but
reduces its ability to form complex spatial structures on the solid surface of
MSgg plates. Hence, it is considered that YmdB plays a key role in biofilm
formation, and this effect is likely achieved through the function of repressor
SinR in B. cereus 0-9. Furthermore, by comparing the amino acid sequences of YmdB
by Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) in Genebank, we found that YmdB
homologues are present in a variety of bacteria (Including Gram-negative
bacteria) except B. subtilis and B. cereus. All these bacteria come at different 
evolutionary distances and belong to different genera. Therefore, we believe that
YmdB exists in many types of bacteria and plays an important role in the
stress-resistance of bacteria to adapt to the environment. These results can help
us to further understand the biocontrol characteristics of B. cereus 0-9.
