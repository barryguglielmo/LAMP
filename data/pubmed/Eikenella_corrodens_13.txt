Eikenella corrodens is a facultatively anaerobic gram-negative rod bacterium in
the oropharynx and respiratory tract. It is a member of HACEK (Haemophilus spp., 
Aggregatibacter spp., Cardiobacterium hominis, E. corrodens, and Kingella kingae)
group commonly associated with endocarditis and craniofacial infections. It is
usually susceptible to penicillin, second and third-generation cephalosporins,
and carbapenem, but has variable susceptibility to first-generation
cephalosporin. We herein provide a description of the first case of pediatric
acute dacryocystitis caused by E. corrodens. The patient did not respond to oral 
cephalexin and required surgical drainage followed by intravenous cefotaxime.
Also provided is a brief review of the current literature.
