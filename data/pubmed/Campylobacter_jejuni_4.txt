Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli, the primary agents of human bacterial
gastroenteritis worldwide, are widespread in surface water. Several animal
sources contribute to surface water contamination with Campylobacter, but their
relative contributions thus far remained unclear. Here, the prevalence, genotype 
diversity, and potential animal sources of C. jejuni and C. coli strains in
surface water in the Netherlands were investigated. It was also assessed whether 
the contribution of the different animal sources varied according to surface
water type (i.e. agricultural water, surface water at discharge points of
wastewater treatment plants [WWTPs], and official recreational water), season,
and local livestock (poultry, pig, ruminant) density. For each surface water
type, 30 locations spread over six areas with either high or low density of
poultry, ruminants, or pigs, were sampled once every season in 2018-2019.
Campylobacter prevalence was highest in agricultural waters (77%), and in autumn 
and winter (74%), and lowest in recreational waters (46%) and in summer (54%). In
total, 76 C. jejuni and 177 C. coli water isolates were whole-genome sequenced.
Most C. coli water isolates (78.5%) belonged to hitherto unidentified clones when
using the seven-locus sequence type (ST) scheme, while only 11.8% of the C.
jejuni isolates had unidentified STs. The origin of these isolates, as defined by
core-genome multi-locus sequence typing (cgMLST), was inferred by comparison with
Campylobacter strain collections from meat-producing poultry, laying hens, adult 
cattle, veal calves, small ruminants, pigs, and wild birds. Water isolates were
mainly attributed to wild birds (C. jejuni: 60.0%; C. coli: 93.7%) and
meat-producing poultry (C. jejuni: 18.9%; C. coli: 5.6%). Wild bird contribution 
was high among isolates from recreational waters and WWTP discharge points, and
in areas with low poultry (C. coli) or high ruminant (C. jejuni) densities. The
contribution of meat-producing poultry was high in areas with high density of
poultry, springtime, agricultural waters and WWTP discharge points. While wild
birds and poultry were the main contributors to Campylobacter contamination in
surface water, their contribution differed significantly by water type, season,
and local poultry and ruminant densities.
