In the present study, a potential newly isolated thermotolerant acetic acid
bacteria (TH-AAB), Acetobacter pasteurianus FPB2-3, with ethanol and acetic
acid-tolerant properties was found to be very effective in the production of
vinegar from pineapple peels as an alternative, inexpensive raw material using
simultaneous vinegar fermentation (SVF). The results showed that using whole
pineapple peel with the addition of diammonium phosphate (DAP) and MgSO4 at an
initial pH of 5.5 gave a slightly higher acetic acid content than that produced
from the squeezed juice. Subsequently, the effects of sugar concentration and
inoculation time of A. pasteurianus FPB2-3 on acetic acid production were
examined. The results revealed that an increase in sucrose concentration led to
the high production of ethanol, which resulted in the suppression of acetic acid 
production. Allowing for the inoculated yeast to ferment prior to inoculation of 
the AAB for 1 or 2 days resulted in a longer lag time for ethanol oxidation.
However, acetic acid accumulation commenced after 5 days and gradually increased 
to the maximum concentration of 7.2% (w/v) within 16 days. Furthermore, scaled-up
fermentation in 6 l vessels resulted in slower acetic acid accumulation but still
achieved a maximum acetic acid concentration of up to 6.5% (w/v) after 25 days.
Furthermore, the antioxidant capacity of the vinegar produced from pineapple
peels (PPV) was slightly higher than that produced from the squeezed juice (PJV),
which was consistent with the higher total phenolic compound content found in the
PPV sample. In addition to acetic acid, a main volatile acid present in vinegars,
other volatile compounds, such as alcohols (isobutyl alcohol, isoamyl alcohol,
and 2-phenyl ethanol), acids (3-methyl-butanoic acid), and esters (ethyl acetate,
3-methyl butanol acetate, and 2-phenylethyl acetate), were also detected and
might have contributed to the observed differences in the odour and aroma of the 
pineapple vinegars.
