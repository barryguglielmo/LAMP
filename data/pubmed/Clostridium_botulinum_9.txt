Toxins are the major pathogenicity factors produced by numerous bacteria involved
in severe diseases in humans and animals. Certain pathogenic bacteria synthesize 
only one toxin which is responsible for all the symptoms and outcome of the
disease. For example, botulinum toxins (BoNTs) and tetanus toxin (TeNT) are the
unique causal factors of botulism and tetanus, respectively. Other bacteria
attack the host organism by a set of multiple toxins which synergistically act to
promote the disease. This is the case of Clostridium and Staphylococcus strains
which secrete wide ranges of toxins such as pore-forming toxins, membrane
phospholipid damaging toxins, and other cytotoxins and toxins interacting with
the immune system involved in gangrene lesion generation.
