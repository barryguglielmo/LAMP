Binase is an extracellular guanyl-preferring ribonuclease from Bacillus pumilus. 
The main biological function of binase is RNA degradation with the formation of
guanosine-2',3'-cyclic phosphate and its subsequent hydrolysis to 3'-phosphate.
Extracellular RNases are believed to be key agents that affect the functional
activity of the body, as they directly interact with epithelial and immune cells.
The biological effects of the enzyme may consist of both direct RNA degradation, 
and the accumulation of 2',3'-cGMP in the human body. In this work, we have
performed a comparative analysis of the cleavage efficiency of model RNA
substrates, i.e., short hairpin structures that contain guanosine at various
positions. It has been shown that the hydrolysis efficiency of the model RNA
substrates depends on the position of guanosine. We have also demonstrated the
influence of various divalent metal ions and low molecular weight nucleotide
compounds on the binase-catalyzed endoribonucleolytic reaction.
