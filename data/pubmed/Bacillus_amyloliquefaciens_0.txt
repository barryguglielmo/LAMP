1-Deoxynojirumycin (1-DNJ) is a representative iminosugar with α-glucosidase
inhibition (AGI) activity. In this study, the full genome sequencing of
1-DNJ-producing Bacillus velezensis K26 was performed. The genome consists of a
circular chromosome (4,047,350 bps) with two types of putative virulence factors,
five antibiotic resistance genes, and seven secondary metabolite biosynthetic
gene clusters. Genomic analysis of a wide range of Bacillus species revealed that
a 1-DNJ biosynthetic gene cluster was commonly present in four Bacillus species
(B. velezensis, B. pseudomycoides, B. amyloliquefaciens, and B. atrophaeus). In
vitro experiments revealed that the increased mRNA expression levels of the three
1-DNJ biosynthetic genes were closely related to increased AGI activity. Genomic 
comparison and alignment of multiple gene sequences indicated the conservation of
the 1-DNJ biosynthetic gene cluster in each Bacillus species. This genomic
analysis of Bacillus species having a 1-DNJ biosynthetic gene cluster could
provide a basis for further research on 1-DNJ-producing bacteria.
