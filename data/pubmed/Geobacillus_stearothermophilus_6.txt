A NADH-dependent engineered amine dehydrogenase from Geobacillus
stearothermophilus (LE-AmDH-v1) was applied together with a NADH-oxidase from
Streptococcus mutans (NOx) for the kinetic resolution of pharmaceutically
relevant racemic α-chiral primary amines. The reaction conditions (e. g., pH,
temperature, type of buffer) were optimised to yield S-configured amines with up 
to >99 % ee.
