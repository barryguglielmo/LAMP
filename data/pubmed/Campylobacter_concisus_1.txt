High Campylobacter prevalence during early childhood has been associated with
stunting and environmental enteric dysfunction (EED), especially in low resource 
settings. This study assessed the prevalence, diversity, abundance, and
co-occurrence of Campylobacter spp. in stools from children in a rural area of
eastern Ethiopia and their association with microbiome, diarrhea, and EED in
children. Stool samples (n = 100) were collected from randomly selected children 
(age range: 360-498 days) in five kebeles in Haramaya District, Ethiopia.
Diarrhea, compromised gut permeability, and gut inflammation were observed in 48,
45, and 57% of children, respectively. Campylobacter prevalence and species
diversity were assessed using PCR and meta-total RNA sequencing (MeTRS). The
prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in the children's stools was 50% (41-60%) by PCR
and 88% (80-93.6%) by MeTRS (P < 0.01). Further, seven Campylobacter species
(Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter upsaliensis, Campylobacter hyointestinalis, 
Campylobacter coli, Campylobacter sp. RM6137, uncultured Campylobacter sp., and
Campylobacter sp. RM12175) were detected by MeTRS in at least 40% of children
stools in high abundance (>1.76-log read per million per positive stool sample). 
Four clusters of Campylobacter species (5-12 species per cluster) co-occurred in 
the stool samples, suggesting that Campylobacter colonization of children may
have occurred through multiple reservoirs or from a reservoir in which several
Campylobacter species may co-inhabit. No associations between Campylobacter spp.,
EED, and diarrhea were detected in this cross-sectional study; however,
characteristic microbiome profiles were identified based on the prevalence of
Campylobacter spp., EED severity, and diarrhea. Forty-seven bacterial species
were correlated with Campylobacter, and 13 of them also correlated with gut
permeability, gut inflammation and/or EED severity. Forty-nine species not
correlated with Campylobacter were correlated with gut permeability, gut
inflammation, EED severity and/or diarrhea. This study demonstrated that (1) in
addition to C. jejuni and C. coli, multiple non-thermophilic Campylobacter spp.
(i.e., Campylobacter hyointestinalis, Campylobacter fetus, and Campylobacter
concisus) were frequently detected in the children's stools and (2) the
Campylobacter, gut permeability, gut inflammation, EED severity, and diarrhea
were associated with characteristic microbiome composition. Additional spatial
and longitudinal studies are needed to identify environmental reservoirs and
sources of infection of children with disparate Campylobacter species and to
better define their associations with EED in low-income countries.
