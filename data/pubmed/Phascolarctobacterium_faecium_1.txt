The gut microbiota is often affected by the dietary and lifestyle habits of the
host, resulting in a better efficacy that favors energy harvesting from the
consumed food. Our objective was to characterize the composition of gut
microbiota in adult Saudis and investigate possible association with lifestyle
and dietary practices. Feces from 104 Saudi volunteers (48% males) were tested
for microbiota by sequencing the V3-V4 region of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA
(rRNA). For all participants, data were collected related to their lifestyle
habits and dietary practices. The relative abundance (RA) of Fusobacteria was
significantly higher in normal weight Saudis (P = 0.005, false discovery rate-FDR
= 0.014). Individuals who consumed more coffee presented marginally significant
more RA of Fusobacteria (P = 0.02, FDR = 0.20) in their gut microbiota compared
to those reporting low or no coffee intake, but the RA of Fusobacteria was
significantly higher in smokers compared to non-smokers (P = 0.009, FDR = 0.027).
The RA of Fusobacteria was also significantly higher in those reporting daily
consumption of bread (P = 0.005, FDR = 0.015). At the species level, the gut
microbiota of people who consumed coffee was dominated by Bacteroides
thetaiotaomicron followed by Phascolarctobacterium faecium and Eubacterium
rectale. Similarly, the gut microbiota of smokers was also enriched by B.
thetaiotaomicron and Lactobacillus amylovorus. Smoking cessation, bread and
coffee consumption induce changes in the intestinal microbial composition of
Saudis. This indicates the significance of diet and lifestyle practices in the
determination of the composition of the gut microbiota, which could possibly lead
later to changes in metabolic profile and weight.
