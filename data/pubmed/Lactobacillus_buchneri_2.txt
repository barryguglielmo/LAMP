This study assessed the effects of antibacterial peptide-producing Bacillus
subtilis (BS), Lactobacillus buchneri (LB), or their combination on fermentation,
proteolysis, aerobic stability, and microbial communities during ensiling and
aerobic exposure phases of alfalfa silage. The results showed that the BS-treated
silage displayed a higher lactic acid concentration, less proteolysis, and higher
aerobic stability than those in the control silage. Both LB and BS treatments
increased Lactobacillus and Ascochyta abundance, and decreased Enterococcus and
Sporormiacea abundance after 60 d of fermentation. LB and BS also inhibited the
growth of Enterococcus after 3 d of aerobic exposure but similar to the control
silage, the fungal community of BS silage was dominated by Candida and Pichia
after 9 d of aerobic exposure. Therefore, inoculation of BS improved silage
fermentation quality, aerobic stability and bacterial community during ensiling
and after 3 d of aerobic exposure.
