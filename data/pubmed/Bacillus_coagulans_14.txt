Benefits associated with probiotic use have been reported; however, the
mechanisms behind these benefits are poorly understood. The effects of a
probiotic formulation (MegaDuo™) containing Bacillus coagulans SC208 and Bacillus
subtilis HU58 on intestinal permeability and immune markers was assessed using a 
combination of the in vitro gut model, the mucosal simulator of the human
intestinal microbial ecosystem (M-SHIME®), and an in vitro inflammatory bowel
disease-like Caco-2/THP1 co-culture model in both healthy and antibiotic-induced 
dysbiosis conditions. Established M-SHIME® proximal colon vessels were treated
with/without clindamycin (1 week) and then with/without daily MegaDuo™ treatment 
(2 weeks). The mucosal and luminal microbial communities were sampled weekly.
Suspensions were removed from the proximal colon vessels after 1 and 2 weeks of
MegaDuo™ treatment and added to the co-culture system. Transepithelial resistance
(membrane barrier function), cytokine/chemokine release, and NFκB activity were
then measured. Under conditions of antibiotic-induced dysbiosis, suspensions from
MegaDuo™ treated vessels showed reduced gut membrane barrier damage and decreased
levels of TNFα and IL-6 compared with suspensions from untreated vessels; no
appreciable differences were observed under healthy conditions. MegaDuo™
treatment had no effect on NFκB activity of THP1-Blue™ cells. The potential
benefits of MegaDuo™ treatment appeared most evident after 2 weeks of treatment.
