Carnitine, a molecule found in red meat, is metabolized to trimethylamine (TMA)
by the gut microbiota. TMA is then converted in the liver to trimethylamine
oxide, a causative agent for atherosclerosis. Kountz et al have discovered an
alternative pathway for carnitine metabolism in the gut bacterium Eubacterium
limosum Instead of forming TMA, carnitine is demethylated by the newly discovered
methyltransferase MtcB, sending one-carbon units into production of short-chain
fatty acids. These results suggest that bacterial metabolic activities could
promote cardiovascular health by preventing the buildup of toxin precursors.
