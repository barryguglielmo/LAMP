BACKGROUND: We investigate here the presence of multidrug-resistant bacteria
isolated from stool samples of yellow-legged gulls and chickens (n = 136) in
urban parks and beaches of Marseille, France. Bacterial isolation was performed
on selective media, including MacConkey agar with ceftriaxone and LBJMR medium.
Antibiotic resistance genes, including extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL)
(i.e. blaCTX-M, blaTEM and blaSHV), carbapenemases (blaKPC, blaVIM, blaNDM,
blaOXA-23, blaOXA-24, blaOXA-48 and blaOXA-58) and colistin resistance genes
(mcr-1 to mcr-5) were screened by real-time PCR and standard PCR and sequenced
when found.
RESULTS: Of the 136 stools samples collected, seven ESBL-producing Gram-negative 
bacteria (BGN) and 12 colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were isolated. Among 
them, five ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and eight colistin-resistant Hafnia
alvei strains were identified. Four blaTEM-1 genes were detected in yellow-legged
gulls and chickens. Three CTX-M-15 genes were detected in yellow-legged gulls and
pigeons, and one CTX-M-1 in a yellow-legged gull. No mcr-1 to mcr-5 gene were
detected in colistin-resistant isolates. Genotyping of E. coli strains revealed
four different sequence types already described in humans and animals and one new
sequence type.
CONCLUSIONS: Urban birds, which are believed to have no contact with antibiotics 
appear as potential source of ESBL genes. Our findings highlight the important
role of urban birds in the proliferation of multidrug-resistant bacteria and also
the possible zoonotic transmission of such bacteria from wild birds to humans.
