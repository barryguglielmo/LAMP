AIM OF THE STUDY: Given that phagocytic cells are main players of the host immune
response, we studied the interaction of bifidobacteria with monocytic THP-1 cells
in non-opsonic conditions.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Association/internalization, cell response (expression of
HLA-DR and TLR2), M1/M2 macrophage polarization and colocalization of
microorganisms with Lysotracker or transferrin were evaluated. Screening with 8
Bifidobacterium strains showed two patterns of interactions with THP-1 cells:
high and low association and phagocytosis. Two strains with different surface
properties were further studied: B. bifidum CIDCA 5310 and B. adolescentis CIDCA 
5317. Strain CIDCA 5310 showed higher levels of colocalization in lysosome than
strain CIDCA 5317. Both strains stimulated TLR2 expression. Strain CIDCA 5317
significantly increases HLA-DR expression, however when cells are stimulated with
IFN-γ, strain CIDCA 5310 induces the highest value of expression. Noteworthy,
strain CIDCA 5310 was able to upregulate both M1 and M2 markers of macrophage
polarization.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that bifidobacteria from human origin show
different patterns of interaction with phagocytic cells thus leading to different
cell responses. These findings add further insight on the mechanisms involved in 
the biologic effects of probiotics.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: Knowledge of the interaction of bifidobacteria 
with key players of the host immune response is paramount for the understanding
of the mechanisms involved in the beneficial effects.
