PURPOSE: To describe the presentation and clinical course of a case of endogenous
endophthalmitis caused by Clostridium septicum, an anaerobic and gram positive
bacteria.
METHODS: Observational report of a clinical case presented in Spain.
CLINICAL CASE: A 61-year-old male patient was referred to our hospital with a
diagnosis of endophthalmitis of his left eye since ten days prior to
presentation, and a history of poor response to medical treatment. Evisceration
was performed, and C. septicum was isolated from a sample of the vitreous humor. 
Fourteen days after surgery, the patient returned with orbital cellulitis, and
exenteration was performed. Forty-two days after initial presentation,
colonoscopy revealed an adenocarcinoma of the proximal colon. Surgical resection 
of the tumor was performed, and clinical recovery was achieved.
CONCLUSIONS: iSystemic C. septicum infection without a traumatic cause has been
associated with malignancy, although an initial presentation of endophthalmitis
has rarely been reported. In cases of clostridial endogenous endophthalmitis,
investigation for colorectal carcinoma is indicated.
