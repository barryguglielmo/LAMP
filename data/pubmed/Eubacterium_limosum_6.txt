This study employed a simultaneous gas feeding and cell-recycled reaction (SGCR) 
system to ferment CO using Eubacterium limosum KIST612. A bubble column reactor
was equipped with an ex-situ hollow fiber membrane module to enable cell
recycling. The internal gas circulation rate was adjusted by controlling the pump
speed to provide sufficient gas supplement to the microorganism. Gas feedings
were conducted by either the use of a gas-tight bag (Batch), a pressurized gas
cylinder (Continuous), or a sequential combination of the two (Mixed feeding).
Mixed feeding mode achieved higher biomass (9.7 g/L) and acetate (9.8 g/L)
concentrations than Batch mode (3.2 g/L biomass and 7.0 g/L acetate) or
Continuous mode (5.0 g/L biomass and 8.1 g/L acetate). The high acetate titer in 
Mixed feeding mode was achieved due to the high concentration of cells secured in
a short time at the initial operation stage and maintaining a high specific
growth rate.
