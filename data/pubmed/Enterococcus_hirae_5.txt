A 2.5-year-old female intact British Shorthair was presented for progressive
complaints of abdominal distention, increased respiratory effort, lethargy and
hyporexia. Based on the clinical presentation and a loud heart murmur, a cardiac 
cause was suspected. An echocardiogram was performed and the presumptive
diagnosis of infective endocarditis of the aortic, mitral and pulmonic valves was
made. Antemortem blood culture and postmortem valve biopsy confirmed bacterial
endocarditis with Enterococcus hirae as etiological agent. To the authors' best
knowledge, this case report is the first to describe an infective endocarditis
with vegetative lesions on three cardiac valves associated with a ventricular
septal defect in a cat, and Enterococcus hirae as causative agent for
endocarditis in small animals.
