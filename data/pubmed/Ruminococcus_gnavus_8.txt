The human gut symbiont Ruminococcus gnavus scavenges host-derived
N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) from mucins by converting it to
2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac. We previously showed that 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac is transported
into R. gnavus ATCC 29149 before being converted back to Neu5Ac for further
metabolic processing. However, the molecular mechanism leading to the conversion 
of 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac to Neu5Ac remained elusive. Using 1D and 2D NMR, we
elucidated the multistep enzymatic mechanism of the oxidoreductase (RgNanOx) that
leads to the reversible conversion of 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac to Neu5Ac through
formation of a 4-keto-2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid intermediate
and NAD+ regeneration. The crystal structure of RgNanOx in complex with the NAD+ 
cofactor showed a protein dimer with a Rossman fold. Guided by the RgNanOx
structure, we identified catalytic residues by site-directed mutagenesis.
Bioinformatics analyses revealed the presence of RgNanOx homologues across
Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial species and co-occurrence with sialic
acid transporters. We showed by electrospray ionization spray MS that the
Escherichia coli homologue YjhC displayed activity against 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac and
that E. coli could catabolize 2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac. Differential scanning
fluorimetry analyses confirmed the binding of YjhC to the substrates
2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac and Neu5Ac, as well as to co-factors NAD and NADH. Finally,
using E. coli mutants and complementation growth assays, we demonstrated that
2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac catabolism in E. coli depended on YjhC and on the predicted
sialic acid transporter YjhB. These results revealed the molecular mechanisms of 
2,7-anhydro-Neu5Ac catabolism across bacterial species and a novel sialic acid
transport and catabolism pathway in E. coli.
