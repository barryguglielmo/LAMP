Phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSBs) shows high potential to be used for lead
passivation in sediments due to the abilities of releasing phosphate and the
subsequent formation of insoluble Pb-phosphate compounds. In this research,
microbial capsules implemented with sodium alginate and CaCl2, containing
Leclercia adecarboxylata L15 (a lead resistant PSB) and Ca3(PO4)2, were developed
and the performance on lead passivation under different conditions was examined. 
The optimal concentrations of sodium alginate and CaCl2 for formulating the
capsules were determined to be 0.3% and 10%, respectively. The removal efficiency
of Pb2+ by capsules containing L15 and Ca3(PO4)2 was up to 98% with a capsule
dosage of 2%, initial Pb2+ concentration of 1mM and pH of 3.0, which was better
than that of free L15 (18%) and capsules containing only L15 (34%). Lead was
immobilized via the formation of Pb5(PO4)3Cl on the surface and Pb3(PO4)2 in the 
interior of the capsules. The simulated sediment remediation experiments showed
that the acid soluble fraction of lead reduced from 28% to 14% and transformed
into more stable fractions after 10 days. The experiment results indicated that
PSBs capsules coupled with phosphate materials have a great promise for
application in remediation of lead contaminated sediments.
