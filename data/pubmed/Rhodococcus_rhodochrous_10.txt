Nitrile hydrolyzing enzymes catalyze the hydration of nitrile compounds to
corresponding amides and acids. Bacteria, isolated from soil samples were
screened for nitrile hydrolyzing enzymes by simple dye based 96 well plate and
nesslerization method. Bromothymol blue was used as an indicator for the
detection of amides and acids based on colour change of the indicator dye from
blue to dark green or yellow. The screening assay also differentiates between
nitrile hydratase (NHase) and nitrilase producing bacteria. Among the 108
bacterial strains screened for enzyme activity, six strains were positive for
NHase activity and eleven strains were positive for nitrilase activity based on
their ability to degrade acrylonitrile into products. The strain showing maximum 
NHase activity in quantitative assay was identified as Rhodococcus rhodochrous.
The modified method developed by us would be useful for rapid screening of
nitrile degrading bacteria potent for acrylamide/acrylic acid production when
acrylonitrile is supplied as substrate.
