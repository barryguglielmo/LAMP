Cellulosimicrobium cellulans, which is type species of the genus
Cellulosimicrobium, produces xylanase predominant nanoscale multienzyme
complexes, i.e., xylanosomes, when grown on water-insoluble polysaccharides.
Here, we report on the isolation of similar multienzyme complexes (MECs) produced
by two other species in genus Cellulosimicrobium (Cellulosimicrobium funkei and
Cellulosimicrobium terreum). Functional studies and subunit structure
identifications using genomic sequencing and proteomic techniques were also
performed. When compared with the xylanosomes produced by C. cellulans F16, the
isolated MECs showed a larger particle size and shared at least three conserved
multidomain proteins. In addition, they also exhibited different enzymatic
activities and subunit compositions, which indicates diverse capability and
strategies in degrading hemicelluloses.
