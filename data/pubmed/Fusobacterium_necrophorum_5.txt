Lemierre's syndrome (LS) is a complex medical condition that is characterized by 
an acute oropharyngeal infection leading to thrombophlebitis of the internal
jugular vein and an eventual metastatic spread to distant vital organs. This
metastatic spread is from septic emboli and is most frequently seen in the lungs,
kidneys, and large joints. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in LS is
extremely rare, and only a few cases of CNS involvement have been reported in the
literature. For all cases of LS, early diagnosis and treatment are crucial, yet
due to the rarity of CNS complications in LS, diagnostic patterns and treatment
algorithms are not fully understood for this subset of presentations. In this
report, we present a case of 19-year-old immune-competent female who presented
with a Fusobacterium oropharyngeal infection that was complicated by suppurative 
sinusitis, cavernous sinus thrombosis, meningitis, and an abducens nerve palsy.
Our patient was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, anticoagulation, and
multiple surgical interventions. This case highlights the importance of an early 
diagnosis and a multidisciplinary approach in managing LS to minimize the
mortality and long-term morbidity of this relatively rare and complicated
multisystem disease.
