INTRODUCTION: Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection (CDI) is commonly
recognised as a nosocomial infection but is increasingly identified in patients
in the community. Antimicrobial exposure which compromises gut microbiota is the 
main risk factor for CDI, although antibiotics remain the main treatment for this
infection. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is also an effective treatment
for CDI. FMT involves the transfer of microbiota from a healthy donor to an
unwell patient. Currently FMT is mostly used after repeated antibiotic treatments
fail to cure CDI. This study investigated the effect of FMT as first-line
treatment for CDI to avoid repeated antibiotic damage of the microbiome.
METHODS: This retrospective, single-centre study included 59 patients between
2012 and 2017 whose first episode of CDI was treated with FMT. The patients'
symptoms and presence of C. difficile in stool samples both at the baseline and
post treatment were documented.
RESULTS: Fifty-four patients completed a final stool test 4-8 weeks post
treatment in which 98% of patients were negative for C. difficile. There were no 
adverse effects. There was a significant reduction in abdominal pain, diarrhoea, 
bloating and blood in the stool at 4-8 weeks post treatment. Data from 24
patients who completed an extended 6 months follow-up showed significant
reduction in abdominal pain, diarrhoea and blood in the stool.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the safety and efficacy of FMT as first-line 
treatment for patients' initial episode of CDI. Future randomised studies are
required to confirm FMT as the initial treatment for CDI.
