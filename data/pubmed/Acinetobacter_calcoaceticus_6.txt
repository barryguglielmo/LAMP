BACKGROUND: With the high demand for diesel across the world, environmental
decontamination from its improper usage, storage and accidental spills becomes
necessary. One highly environmentally friendly and cost-effective decontamination
method is to utilize diesel-degrading microbes as a means for bioremediation.
Here, we present a newly isolated and identified strain of Acinetobacter
calcoaceticus ('CA16') as a candidate for the bioremediation of
diesel-contaminated areas.
RESULTS: Acinetobacter calcoaceticus CA16 was able to survive and grow in minimal
medium with diesel as the only source of carbon. We determined through
metabolomics that A. calcoaceticus CA16 appears to be efficient at diesel
degradation. Specifically, CA16 is able to degrade 82 to 92% of aliphatic alkane 
hydrocarbons (CnHn + 2; where n = 12-18) in 28 days. Several diesel-degrading
genes (such as alkM and xcpR) that are present in other microbes were also found 
to be activated in CA16.
CONCLUSIONS: The results presented here suggest that Acinetobacter strain CA16
has good potential in the bioremediation of diesel-polluted environments.
