Cervicofacial actinomycosis remains a rare pathogenic finding in the paediatric
population. Diagnosis is challenging, as findings are often non-specific and
Actinomyces species are generally difficult to culture. Treatment is a prolonged 
course of antibiotics, either intravenous and oral, often combined with a
surgical procedure to remove the lesion. This patient had non-specific
intermittent left mandibular pain for 8 months that was eventually attributed to 
an Actinomyces odontolyticus infection in the mandible. Diagnosis required
incisional biopsy, and treatment involved 12 months of oral antibiotics.
