This study was conducted to identify patterns of cagA EPIYA motifs in H. pylori
strains isolated from patients with gastrointestinal diseases in Hospitals of
Shahrekord, and investigate the association between these biomarkers and clinical
outcomes of gastrointestinal diseases due to H. pylori. In this study, 253
patients with gastrointestinal diseases were studied within 1395-1396.
Histopathological investigations and urease test showed that 207 isolates were H.
pylori-positive. Then, screening using a molecular technique, PCR, confirmed that
159 isolates had cagA. Finally, the pattern and prevalence of the motifs were
determined by PCR and identified a number of motifs were sequenced. Results of
this study showed that the pattern of motifs was as follows: ABC (140 isolates)
(93/7%), ABCC (6 isolates) (3/77%), ABCCC (4 isolates) (2/5%), AB (7 isolates)
(4/4%), AC (1 isolate) (0/6%), and BC (1 isolate) (0/6%). Sequencing results
showed the presence of changed EPIYA motif in some isolates. CM motif sequence
was also seen in all isolates. In this study, no significant association was seen
between the prevalence rate of different patterns and clinical symptoms (p =
0.71). There is a slight association between the presence of ABC motifs and the
type of digestive disorder (p = 0.056). Results indicated that ABC was the most
frequently seen pattern however, in such that positive cases of ABC motifs were
more common in gastritis. All isolates had kinase phosphorylation region, and the
observed pattern in this region was a generally western type (ABC).
