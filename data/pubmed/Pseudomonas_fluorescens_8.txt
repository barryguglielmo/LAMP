Quaternary alkylammonium compounds (QAACs) are a group of cationic surfactants
which are disinfectants with numerous industrial and agricultural applications
and frequently released into the environment. One recent hypothesis is that
bacteria present in soil will be protected from acute toxic effects of QAACs in
the presence of expandable layer silicates due to interlayer sorption. We
therefore studied bacterial growth kinetics with high temporal resolution and
determined minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of two QAACs,
benzyldimethyldodecylammonium chloride (BAC-C12) and
didecyldimethylammonium chlorid (DADMAC-C10), for eight strains of different
bacterial taxa (Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter, Enterococcus faecium,
Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas fluorescens) in relation to QAAC sorption 
to smectite and kaolinite. The MICs of BAC-C12 and DADMAC-C10 were in the absence
of smectite and kaolinite in the order of 10 to 30 µg mL-1 and 1.0 to 3.5 µg mL-1
for all strains except the more sensitive Acinetobacter strain. For all tested
strains and both tested QAACs, the presence of smectite increased apparent MIC
values while kaolinite had no effect on MICs. Sorption curves without bacteria
showed that smectite sorbed larger amounts of QAACs than kaolinite. Correcting
nominal QAAC concentrations employed in toxicity tests for QAAC sorption using
the sorption curves explained well the observed shifts in apparent MICs.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrated that the interlayer space of 
smectite expanded from 13.7 ± 1 Å to 19.9 ± 1.5 Å after addition of BAC-C12. This
study provides first evidence that low charge 2:1 expandable layer silicates can 
play an important role for buffering QAAC toxicity in soils.
