Activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) and its protein snippet NAP
(drug candidate CP201) regulate synapse formation and cognitive as well as
behavioral functions, in part, through microtubule interaction. Given potential
interactions between the microbiome and brain function, we now investigated the
potential effects of the ADNP-deficient genotype, mimicking the ADNP syndrome on 
microbiota composition in the Adnp+/- mouse model. We have discovered a
surprising robust sexually dichotomized Adnp genotype effect and correction by
NAP (CP201) as follows. Most of the commensal bacterial microbiota tested were
affected by the Adnp genotype and corrected by NAP treatment in a male
sex-dependent manner. The following list includes all the bacterial groups
tested-labeled in bold are male Adnp-genotype increased and corrected (decreased)
by NAP. (1) Eubacteriaceae (EubV3), (2) Enterobacteriaceae (Entero), (3)
Enterococcus genus (gEncocc), (4) Lactobacillus group (Lacto), (5)
Bifidobacterium genus (BIF), (6) Bacteroides/Prevotella species (Bac), (7)
Clostridium coccoides group (Coer), (8) Clostridium leptum group (Cluster IV,
sgClep), and (9) Mouse intestinal Bacteroides (MIB). No similarities were found
between males and females regarding sex- and genotype-dependent microbiota
distributions. Furthermore, a female Adnp+/- genotype associated decrease
(contrasting male increase) was observed in the Lactobacillus group (Lacto).
Significant correlations were discovered between specific bacterial group loads
and open-field behavior as well as social recognition behaviors. In summary, we
discovered ADNP deficiency associated changes in commensal gut microbiota
compositions, a sex-dependent biomarker for the ADNP syndrome and beyond.
Strikingly, we discovered rapidly detected NAP (CP201) treatment-dependent
biomarkers within the gut microbiota.
