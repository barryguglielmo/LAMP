AIM: Recently, higher contamination by aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) has been detected in
many countries. Unfortunately, many tons of contaminated milk and milk byproducts
are removed from the food chain to avoid human contamination; as a consequence of
higher economic losses. Fewest number of studies are interested to AFM1
detoxification using lactic acid bacteria.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, AFM1-degradation using Lactobacillus
paracasei BEJ01 (LPBEJ01) was tested in vitro. The preventive effect of LPBEJ01
against AFM1 immunobiological effects in mice are treated orally during 3 weeks
with 100 µg AFM1, LPBEJ01 (2 × 109 CFU/ml∼2 mg/kg p.c.) and a mixture of AFM1 and
LPBEJ01.
RESULTS: In vitro LPBEJ01 was found able to absorb 98% of AFM1 (100 µg/ml) in
liquid medium after 24 h and more than 95% of AFM1 could be eliminated after 24 h
in a solid-state fermentation. Animals treated with AFM1 obtained lower body
weight than the control ones. The mitogenic response of spleen mononuclear cells 
(SMCs) in vivo was higher in mice treated with AFM1. The SMC of mice treated with
AFM1 produced lower levels of IL-2, higher levels IL-4 and no effect on IL-10
production. The peritoneal macrophages of mice that treated with AFM1 released
less H2O2, while mice exposed orally with the mixture of AFM1 and LPBEJ01
produced higher levels.
CONCLUSION: LPBEJ01 was safe and it did not have any sign of toxicity. It can be 
used as an additive for AFM1-detoxification contamination in the food chain in
countries suffering from this problem.
