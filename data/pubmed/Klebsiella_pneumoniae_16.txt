Recent years Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) biofilm formation (BF) is
emerging thread worldwide. For tackling this problem, we have chosen Hibiscus
rosa-. pneumoniae. The HPLC purified essential oils (EOs sinensis (H.
rosa-sinensis) (HRS) to inhibit the BF K) of H. rosa-sinensis was performed
against BF K. pneumoniae and showed concentration dependent biofilm inhibition.
At the MBIC of EOs (90 µg/ml), the biofilm inhibition was showed at 92% against
selected BF K. Pneumoniae. The biofilm metabolic assay, exopolysaccharide
quantification and hydrophobicity index variation results exhibited with 88%, 92%
and 89% reduction at 90 μg/mL was observed respectively. In addition, the
morphological modification of MBIC treated K. pneumoniae was clearly viewed by
scanning electron microscope (SEM). Overall, all the invitro experiments result
were confirmed that the MBIC of H. rosa-sinensis EOs was very effective against
BF K. pneumonia.
