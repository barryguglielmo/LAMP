Oropharyngeal Candidiasis (OPC) is an opportunistic fungal infection occurring in
immunocompromised  patients such as HIV/AIDS. The purpose of this study was to
evaluate the antifungal properties of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus
plantarum on different Candida species isolated from oral cavity of HIV/AIDS
patients compared to Fluconazole (FLC). In this study, the antifungal effects of 
both cells and cell-free supernatants (CFSs) of L. acidophilus and L. plantarum
were investigated against different oral Candida species by co-aggregation, agar 
overlay interference and broth microdilution assays, respectively. Our results
showed that the highest co-aggregation ratio of the two tested Lactic acid
bacteria (LAB) was observed for C. krusei. Both L. acidophilus and L. plantarum
at cell concentrations 1010 to 102 cfu/ml were able to inhibit the growth of most
of the oral Candida species, except for C. albicans, and to some C. krusei. In
this study, MIC and MFC values for CFS of L. acidophilus ranged from 100 to
200 µl/ml and 100 to 200 µl/ml, respectively, and MIC and MFC values for CFS of
L. plantarum were 50 to 200 µl/ml and 50 to 200 µl/ml, respectively. The ranges
of MIC and MFC for FLC were 256-1024 µg/ml and 512-2048 µg/ml, respectively. C.
albicans and C. parapsilosis displayed the highest and least susceptibility to
CFSs of two LAB, respectively. Our findings showed that both cells and CFSs of L.
acidophilus and L. plantarum had antifungal effects against oral Candida species.
