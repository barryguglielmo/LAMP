Viridans group streptococci (VGS) are a common cause of infective endocarditis,
and dental plaque is the major source of these bacteria. The present study
examined the antibiotic resistance of 635 VGS isolates obtained from dental
plaques. Isolates from supragingival plaques were identified using the rapid ID
32 Strep and mini API reader (bioMÃ©rieux, France), and minimal inhibitory
concentrations (MICs) were determined by a broth microdilution method. High rates
of resistance to ampicillin and tetracycline were detected among the isolates.
The most resistant species were Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus
salivarius. Among the 635 isolates, 9.1% were resistant to erythromycin, and
20.6% to tetracycline. All isolates were sensitive to vancomycin. Resistance to
amoxicillin was observed in 0.2% of all isolates. In this study, we showed the
incidence of antimicrobial resistance and the susceptibility patterns among 635
VGS isolates from dental plaque.
