Multidrug-resistant strains belonging to the Enterobacter cloacae complex (ECC)
group, and especially those belonging to clusters C-III, C-IV, and C-VIII, have
increasingly emerged as a leading cause of health care-associated infections,
with colistin used as one of the last lines of treatment. However,
colistin-resistant ECC strains have emerged. The aim of this study was to prove
that MgrB, the negative regulator of the PhoP/PhoQ two-component regulatory
system, is involved in colistin resistance in ECC of cluster C-VIII, formerly
referred to as Enterobacter hormaechei subsp. steigerwaltii An in vitro mutant
(Eh22-Mut) was selected from a clinical isolate of Eh22. The sequencing analysis 
of its mgrB gene showed the presence of one nucleotide deletion leading to the
formation of a truncated protein of six instead of 47 amino acids. The wild-type 
mgrB gene from Eh22 and that of a clinical strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae used
as controls were cloned, and the corresponding recombinant plasmids were used for
complementation assays. The results showed a fully restored susceptibility to
colistin and confirmed for the first time that mgrB gene expression plays a key
role in acquired resistance to colistin in ECC strains.
