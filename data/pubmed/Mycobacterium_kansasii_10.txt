Cases of nontuberculous Mycobacterium (NTM) are on the rise across North America.
This is the first clinical description of a 31-year old male patient in North
America with Mycobacterium kansasii who met DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for
anorexia nervosa (AN) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and who was
engaged in specialized outpatient treatment of an eating disorder. The patient
did not disclose at intake assessment that he was experiencing symptoms of a
persistent cough, blood in his sputum, or that he was simultaneously being
assessed outside of the eating disorders program for NTM until he had a positive 
smear for Mycobacterium kansasii in March 2017. The patient made progress in
treatment in his weight status and some psychological symptoms despite the
concurrent NTM symptoms. However, later treatment attendance was negatively
impacted by the side effects of his medication regime for NTM and careful
follow-up was required to monitor for potential interactions between his
treatment for NTM and psychiatric medication. This case report provides an
initial window into clinicians' ability to treat a patient with a concurrent
eating disorder and an NTM infection and lessons learned in the process. LEVEL OF
EVIDENCE: Level V: Opinions of respected authorities, based on descriptive
studies, clinical experience, or reports of expert committees.
