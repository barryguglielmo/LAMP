BACKGROUND: The theory of trade-off suggests that limited resources should lead
to trade-off in resource intensive traits such as, immunity related and sexually 
selected traits in males. Alternatively, sexual exaggerations can also act as an 
honest indicator of underlying immunocompetence, leading to positive correlations
between these traits. Evidences in support of either hypothesis in invertebrates 
are equivocal. Whereas several studies have addressed this question, few have
used naturally occurring pathogens and realized post infection realized immunity 
(e.g., survivorship) to assay the fitness correlations between these two sets of 
traits.
RESULTS: Adopting an experimental evolution approach, we evolved replicate
populations of Drosophila melanogaster under high and low sexual selection
regimes for over a hundred generations and found the following in virgin and
mated males in three separate assays: a.Post infection survivorship against two
natural pathogens - Pseudomonas entomophila (Pe) and Staphylococcus succinus
(Ss): Mated males survived better against Pe, but were no different than virgins 
against Ss.b.Bacterial clearance ability against a third natural pathogen
Providencia rettgeri (Pr): Mated males had significantly lower CFUs than virgins.
However, sexual selection history had no effect on realized immunity of either
virgin or mated males.
CONCLUSION: We show that while mating can affect realized immunity in a pathogen 
specific way, sexual selection did not affect the same. The results highlight
that complex polygenic traits such as immunity and reproductive traits not
necessarily evolve following a binary trade-off model. We also stress the
importance natural pathogens while studying sexual selection-immunity
correlations.
