BACKGROUND: Cultures taken at the time of primary shoulder arthroplasty are
commonly positive for Cutibacterium acnes. Despite our limited understanding of
the clinical implication of deep tissue inoculation from dermal colonization,
significant efforts have been made to decolonize the shoulder prior to surgery.
The purpose of this study is to determine differences in clinical outcomes based 
on culture positivity at the time of primary shoulder arthroplasty.
METHODS: A series of 134 patients who underwent primary anatomic or reverse total
shoulder arthroplasty and had intraoperative cultures obtained via a standard
protocol were included. In each case, five tissue samples were collected and
processed in a single laboratory for culture on aerobic and anaerobic media for
13 days. Minimum 2-year functional outcomes scores (ASES and SANE) and
reoperation data was analyzed.
RESULTS: Forty-two (31.3%) patients had positive cultures (30 C. acnes and 21
with at least two positive cultures) at the time of surgery. There was no
statistically significant difference in postoperative functional outcome scores
(ASES: 82.5 vs 81.9; p=0.89, SANE: 79.5 vs 82.1; p=0.54) between culture positive
and culture negative cohorts. There were no cases of infection. Two patients
(4.8%; 2/42) with positive cultures required reoperation compared to four
patients (5.6%; 4/71) without positive cultures.
CONCLUSION: The apparent colonization by non-virulent organisms in patients
undergoing primary shoulder arthroplasty does not appear to have a clinically
significant effect on functional outcomes or need for repeat surgery in the
short-term.
