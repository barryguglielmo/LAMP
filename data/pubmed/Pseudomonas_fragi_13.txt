Two extracts derived from plant material rich in hydrolysable (Tara, T;
Caesalpinia spinosa) or condensed (Mimosa, M; Acacia mearnsii) tannins were added
to lamb's diet and their effects on meat quality and on microbial population were
evaluated; a diet without tannins represented the Control (C). Meat pH, vitamin
E, intramuscular fat content and muscle fatty acid composition were determined.
Oxidative stability and microbiological analyses were performed on meat samples
after 0, 4 and 7 days of refrigerated storage. Psychrotrophic bacteria were
identified through MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Regarding meat fatty acids, Tara
treatment decreased the percentage of monounsaturated fatty acids. The counts of 
all microbial groups were similar among dietary treatments at day 0, while a
significant reduction of microbial loads was observed in T-group at day 7.
Pseudomonas fluorescens group count was significantly affected by T extract
supplementation. The MALDI-TOF MS identification revealed the dominance of
Pseudomonas fragi species in all samples while Pseudomonas lundensis, Brochothrix
thermosphacta and Candida famata were revealed only in control ones. In
conclusions, the tannin extract supplementation is a promising dietary strategy
to preserve lamb meat quality.
