Antibiotic resistance and especially multiresistance in Enterococci, is a serious
public health issue especially in infections of immunocompromised patients. EfrAB
is a heterodimeric multidrug ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that causes
endogenous resistance to antimicrobials including fluoroquinolones in
Enterococcus spp. The aim of this study was to seek the gene expression rate and 
role of efrAB efflux pump in ciprofloxacin resistant Enterococcus faecalis and
Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) of multiresistant isolates. Phenotypic and
genotyping identification of 80 E. faecalis isolates were performed. Minimum
inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to ciprofloxacin (CIP) were measured with and
without carbonylcyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) by broth microdilution.
After DNA extraction and sequencing for detection of efrA and efrB genes, the
efrAB efflux positive isolates that were resistant to ciprofloxacin and showed
decrease of ciprofloxacin MIC range were identified. Isolates that exhibited
decrease in ciprofloxacin MIC range from two to ten folds were assessed for
biofilm formation and finally, the expression levels of efrB, efrA genes were
measured by quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR). High rates of resistance to
tetracycline and minocycline and low rates of resistance to the most antibiotics 
used in this study were detected. The results in this study indicated that the
incidence of Multiple drug resistance (MDR) was 23.7% and all isolates that were 
resistant to ciprofloxacin revealed several degrees of overexpression in efrA and
efrB genes. Our study found two ST480 and one ST847 in E. faecalis isolates. In
conclusion, despite of low frequency of resistance to the most antibiotics and
MDRs in our region, we found one ST480 isolate with resistance to eight
antibiotics that also exists in other parts of the world.
