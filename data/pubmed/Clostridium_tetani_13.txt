BACKGROUND: Clostridium tetani is a gram-positive spore-forming bacterium that
produces toxins and grows under anaerobic conditions. Infections with this
bacterium can lead to local or generalised forms of tetanus.
CASE DESCRIPTION: An 83-year-old man presented to the acute cardiac care unit
with a painful left arm and jaw. Because the patient had a hypertonic left arm
and was unable to open his mouth fully, the neurologist was consulted. The
patient had been to the emergency department 9 days earlier for an infected wound
after falling in the garden. He had not been actively or passively immunised
against tetanus at that time. On inquiry, it appeared that the patient had also
not been vaccinated as a child. We made a clinical diagnosis of tetanus. The
patient was admitted and treated with tetanus immunoglobulin, metronidazole,
diazepam and painkillers. He was also administered tetanus toxoid and the wound
was cleaned. After 1 month and 7 months, the patient was again administered
tetanus toxoid.
CONCLUSION: Patients with a wound that may have come into contact with road
grime, dirt or manure, should always be asked for their vaccination status,
especially people from high-risk groups, such as the elderly.
