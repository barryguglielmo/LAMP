Bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) is a nanofibrillar polymer that possesses unique
characteristics such as high chemical purity, mechanical strength, flexibility,
and absorbency. In addition, different bacterial strains can form nanocellulose
(NC) in multiple shapes and sizes. This study describes the first report of a
marine Bacillus strain that is able to synthesize NC. The strain identified as B.
velezensis SMR based on 16S rDNA sequencing, produced highly structured NC, as
confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopic Analysis
(SEM). In Hestrin-Schramm (HS) medium, B. velezensis SMR produced twice the
quantity of BNC in comparison to the reference strain, G. xylinus ATCC 10245. The
ability of B. velezensis SMR to produce NC using different industrial waste
materials as growth media was tested. Growth in Ulva seaweed extract supported a 
2.5-fold increase of NC production by B. velezensis SMR and a threefold increase 
in NC production by G. xylinus ATCC 10245. As proof of principle for the
usability of NC from B. velezensis SMR, we successfully fabricated a BNC-based
polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel (BNC-PVA) system, a promising material used in
different fields of application such as medicine, food, and agriculture.
