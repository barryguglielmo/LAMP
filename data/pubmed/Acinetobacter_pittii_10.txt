OBJECTIVES: NDM-1 is by far one of the most commonly prevalent carbapenemases in 
Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter baumannii. This study presented an
Acinetobacter pittii (A. pittii) isolate co-harboring blaNDM-1 and blaOXA-820
from a university hospital sink, where New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM)
producers have not been found in either patients or their environments.
METHODS: Whole-genome sequencing was performed on the HiSeq 4000 platform, and
the reads were de novo assembled using the A5-miSeq Assembly pipeline. Annotation
of the resulting scaffolds were performed by using the DDBJ Fast Annotation and
Submission Tool (DFAST). The blaNDM-1-carrying plasmid was determined.
RESULTS: The A. pittii ST220 strain SU1805 detected from a sink strainer in the
treatment room was resistant to imipenem and meropenem. Antimicrobial resistance 
genes blaNDM-1, blaOXA-820, blaADC-43, and aphA6 were found in this strain. The
blaNDM-1 was found to be located downstream of an ISAba125 element on a plasmid
pSU1805NDM with a size of 41,022 bp, and GC content of 38.3% harbouring 48
protein-coding genes. The aphA6 gene was also located upstream of the ISAba125 on
the same plasmid. The A. pittii intrinsic blaOXA-213-like gene blaOXA-820 was
located between fxsA and yncA genes in the chromosome. The strain also harboured 
biofilm-associated genes such as ompA, the csu operon and their regulating genes 
bfmRS.
CONCLUSION: This study described the first isolation of NDM-1-producing A. pittii
in Japan, and highlighted the importance of proper implementation of measures
against AMR for sink drainage systems, since NDM producers may have already been 
hidden in such environments in a non-endemic country of NDM.
