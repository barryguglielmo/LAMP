AIM: The objective of this study was to evaluate the presence of microorganisms
in the root canals (RC) of teeth submitted to endodontic retreatment due to
prosthetic reasons and without evidence of apical periodontitis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty teeth referred to endodontic retreatment due to
prosthetic reasons and without evidence of apical periodontitis were included in 
this study. Gutta-percha (GP) was collected from each third of the RC. After GP
removal, microbial samples were also collected from the full extension of RC
using paper points and files. The samples were cultivated in Fastidious Anaerobe 
Agar and the colony-forming units (CFU/mL) were counted. They were also
semi-quantitatively analyzed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization using 40 DNA
bacterial probes.
RESULTS: Microorganisms were found in all samples. The coronal third of GP was
more contaminated than the apical third (p ≤ 0.05). There was prevalence of
Enterococcus hirae and Enterococcus faecalis in all RC thirds and also in the
samples collected from the full extension of RCs.
CONCLUSION: Microorganisms were found in all cases referred to endodontic
retreatment due to prosthetic reasons and without evidence of apical
periodontitis. Enterococcus was the genus most frequently detected.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: An endodontic retreatment should be considered before
replacing a prosthesis.
