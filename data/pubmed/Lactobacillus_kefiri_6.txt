The increasing incidence of gastrointestinal tract pathologies in dogs and the
worrisome topic of antibiotic resistance have raised the need to look for new
therapeutic frontiers. Of these, the use of probiotics represents a potential
therapeutic alternative. Lactobacillus kefiri (Lk) is a species of Lactobacillus 
isolated from kefir. Previous studies have demonstrated that its administration
in mice downregulates the expression of proinflammatory mediators and increases
anti-inflammatory molecules in the gut immune system. It also regulates
intestinal homeostasis, incrementing immunoglobulin A (IgA) secretion. Since Lk
has never been studied as a single probiotic in dogs, the aim of this study was
to evaluate the safety of Lk in dogs, and its effect on IgA secretion and on
intestinal microbiota composition. Ten healthy dogs without a history of
gastrointestinal diseases were included. The dogs received Lk at a dose of 107
live microorganisms orally, once daily for 30 days. The fecal samples were tested
before administration, in the middle, at the end, and 30 days after
discontinuation. The IgA secretion concentration and the microbiota composition
were evaluated on the fecal samples. The results in this study suggested that Lk 
did not influence the concentration of IgA, nor significant changes of the
intestinal microbiota were observed during and after the treatment. Therefore,
additional studies are needed to investigate if a higher daily dosage of Lk can
influence the intestinal homeostasis of dogs.
