INTRODUCTION: Lemierre syndrome is a rare, potentially fatal, septic
thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein. Treatment includes intravenous
antibiotics for Fusobacterium necrophorum, the most common pathogen, as well as
consideration for anticoagulation therapy.
CASE REPORT: A 27-year-old female presented with left-sided neck swelling and
erythema. Computed tomography noted left anterior jugular vein thrombophlebitis
and multiple cavitating foci, consistent with septic emboli. We report a rare
case of Lemierre syndrome in which the thrombus was found in the anterior jugular
vein, as opposed to the much larger internal jugular vein more traditionally
associated with creating septic emboli.
CONCLUSION: Based on an individual's clinical symptoms, history, and radiologic
findings, it is important for physicians to consider Lemierre syndrome in the
differential diagnosis, as the condition may rapidly progress to septic shock and
death if not treated promptly. The use of anticoagulation therapy remains
controversial, and there is a lack of established standard care because the
syndrome is so rare.
