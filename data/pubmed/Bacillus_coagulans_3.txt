Bacillus coagulans LBSC showed stability in acidic pH, bile and simulated human
gastrointenstinal juices. Under static gut model, when passed through oral,
gastric and intestinal phases, B. coagulans LBSC was found to be stable as free
viable spores and also with various foods such as milk and baby foods, as well as
American and European diets. In human studies, modulation of gut microbiota by B.
coagulans LBSC was comprehended by whole genome metagenome analysis of fecal
samples obtained from pre- and post-treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
patients. B. coagulans LBSC treatment showed positive modulation in gut
microbiota, especially up regulation of phyla such as Actinobacteria and
Firmicutes, whereas down regulation of Bacteroids, Proteobacteria, Streptophyta
and Verrucomicrobia. Simultaneously, it has altered various microbiota associated
metabolic pathways to create the normalcy of gut microenvironment.
