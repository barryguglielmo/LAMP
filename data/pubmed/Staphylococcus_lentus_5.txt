BACKGROUND: The pathogens most commonly associated with acute bacterial
rhinosinusitis include Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenza, and
Moraxella catarrhalis. The pathogens most commonly associated with chronic
rhinosinusitis include Staphylococcus aureus and various anaerobic organisms,
including Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, and Peptostreptococcus. This 
case report illustrates a case of chronic rhinosinusitis associated with the
Staphylococcus lentus organism, a well-known animal pathogen that has never been 
documented in the sinonasal cavity before.
METHODS: The medical records of an adult patient who presented to the
otolaryngology office were reviewed. The literature available was reviewed.
RESULTS: A 62-year-old man presented with chronic rhinosinusitis refractory to
medical management. He was taken to the operating room for functional endoscopic 
sinus surgery and cultures were obtained, which returned positive for
Staphylococcus lentus. He had no known animal contacts at home or work. He
improved with surgery and appropriate antibiotic therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Staphylococcus lentus has never before been reported as a human
pathogen in the sinonasal cavities. Otolaryngologists must routinely obtain
cultures of mucus or tissue during sinus surgery in order to ensure appropriate
antibiotic treatment after surgery and resolution of patient symptoms.
