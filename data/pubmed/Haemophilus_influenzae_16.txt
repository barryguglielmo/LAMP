Background: We studied the distribution of pathogenic bacteria in lower
respiratory tract infection in lung cancer patients after chemotherapy and
analyzed the integron resistance genes in respiratory tract isolates of
uninfected patients.
Methods: Retrospective analysis was used to select sputum samples from 400 lung
cancer patients after chemotherapy admitted in Fuyang People's Hospital from July
2017 to July 2019. Culture, isolation and identification of strains were
conducted in accordance with the national clinical examination operating
procedures.
Results: A total of 134 strains were identified. In 120 patients with pulmonary
infection, 114 strains were cultured. Twenty strains of klebsiella pneumoniae
were cultured in 280 patients without pulmonary infection. Among the 134 strains,
the detection rate of gram-negative bacteria was 79.10%. The first four strains
were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and
Haemophilus influenzae. The gram-positive bacteria detection rate was 4.47%,
mainly Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus. The fungus detection rate was
16.42%. The drug sensitivity results showed that the resistance rate of
gram-negative bacillus to penicillin and cephalosporin was higher, and were more 
sensitive to carbapenem, piperacillin tazobactam and cefoperazone sulbactam.
Gram-positive cocci were resistant to penicillin, macrolide and clindamycin, and 
sensitive to linezolid, vancomycin and rifampicin. All strains of fungal culture 
were candida albicans, which were sensitive to common antifungal drugs. Among the
20 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae cultured in sputum specimens of non-infected 
patients with lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy, 2 strains were
integron-positive strains, and all of them were class I integrons.
Conclusions: Lung cancer patients after chemotherapy have a high resistance to
commonly used antimicrobial drugs, so it is necessary to detect the resistance of
pathogenic microorganisms in clinical practice. The strains carried by patients
with lung cancer without pulmonary infection during chemotherapy can isolate type
I integrons, suggesting that the spread of drug resistance at gene level should
be closely detected.
