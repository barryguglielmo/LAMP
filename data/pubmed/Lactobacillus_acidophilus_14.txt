In the present study, probiotic cells (Lactobacillus acidophilus) were
encapsulated by spray drying technology to produce a probiotic powder using 20%
maltodextrin and varied concentrations of gum arabic. The effects of processing
conditions such as inlet air temperature (130-150 °C) and gum arabic
concentration (0-10%) on the encapsulation efficiency, physical properties, and
morphology were studied. For all the tested formulae, the moisture content, water
activity, encapsulation efficiency, hygroscopicity, and wettability obtained were
in the range of 4.59-9.05% (w.b.), 0.33-0.52, 65-89.15%, 12 to 21.15 g H2O per
100 g dry weight, and 116 s to 353 s, respectively. The Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) results have shown that gum arabic and maltodextrin show
structural stability during spray drying. The encapsulated probiotic cells
exhibited better viability of 4.03, 4.68, and 5.34 log CFU g-1 after 3 h of
exposure to a simulated gastric fluid (SGF) solution at pH levels of 1, 1.5, and 
2, respectively, compared to free cells. The viability of encapsulated cells
stored for 12 weeks under refrigerated conditions (4 °C) and at room temperature 
(25 °C) was found to be 6.05 log CFU g-1 and 1.24 log CFU g-1, respectively.
