Gut microbiota composition and functionality are closely linked to host health.
In this study, the fecal microbiota and bifidobacterial communities of 111
healthy volunteers from four regions of China of varying age profiles (Child, 1-5
years; Young, 18-50 years; Elder, 60-80 years; Longevity, â‰¥90 years) were
investigated via high-throughput sequencing. Canonical analysis revealed that the
gut microbiota, as well as bifidobacteria profiles of the subjects, clustered
according to their regions and age. Eight genera were shared among all subjects, 
however, certain genera distributed differently in subjects grouped by region and
age. Faecalibacterium was enriched in samples from Zhongxiang, unclassified
Ruminococcaceae and Christensenellaceae were enriched in the Longevity group, and
Bifidobacterium was enriched in Child. Within Bifidobacterium, B. longum was the 
most abundant species in almost all samples except for Child, in which B.
pseudocatenulatum was the most abundant. Additionally, the abundances of B.
adolescentis and B. dentium were lower in Child. In conclusion, our results
suggest that geography and age affect the structure of the gut microbiota, as
well as Bifidobacterium composition, and this variation may greatly associate
with the metabolic and immune changes that occur during the process of aging.
