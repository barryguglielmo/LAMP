OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence and characteristics of
methicillin-resistant staphylococci on dairy farms in England and Wales including
zoonotic MRSA.
METHODS: Bulk tank milk was sampled from 363 dairy farms in 2015-2016 and
methicillin-resistant staphylococci were isolated by salt broth enrichment and
plating on MRSA Brilliance selective agar. Isolates were characterised through
antimicrobial susceptibility testing and whole-genome sequencing.
RESULTS: Methicillin-resistant staphylococci were isolated from ∼5% of dairy
farms and belonged to six different species, Staphylococcus aureus,
Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus lentus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, 
Staphylococcus fleurettii and Staphylococcus sciuri. Whole-genome sequencing
revealed a large variety of antimicrobial resistance genes and SCCmec elements
were present, including mecA and mecC alleles. Potentially zoonotic
methicillin-resistance S. aureus were found at a low prevalence (0.83% of sampled
dairy farms). Whole-genome sequencing also provided evidence for the mobility of 
a primordial mec gene complex, independently of a SCCmec element, which appears
to have been acquired by S. saprophyticus from S. fleurettii.
CONCLUSIONS: These data give new insight into the epidemiology of veterinary
methicillin-resistant staphylococci to inform future surveillance and zoonotic
risk evaluation. Our data indicate that MRSA has likely decreased in prevalence
since earlier survey work in England and Wales during 2011-12 and highlights the 
diversity of methicillin resistance and other resistance determinants among
bovine-associated staphylococci with implications for veterinary and human
medicine.
