Nerium oleander L., commonly known as oleander, is a toxic shrub and also a
medicinal plant. All parts of oleander are rich in cardiac glycosides that
inhibits Na+/K+-ATPase and induce inotropic effect on the cardiomyocytes. Several
pre-clinical and clinical reports indicate acute toxicity due to intentional,
accidental and suicidal oleander consumption. Contrarily, oleander is used for
the treatment of diverse ailments in traditional medicinal practices around the
globe and several evidence-based pre-clinical studies indicated metabolic and
immunological health benefits of polyphenol-rich oleander extracts. Thus, the
current review aims to address this pharmaco-toxicological conundrum of oleander 
by addressing the possible role of gut microflora in the differential oleander
toxicity. Additionally, a comprehensive account of ethnopharmacological usage,
metabolic and immunological health benefits has been documented that supplement
the conflicting arguments of pharmaco-toxicological properties of oleander.
Finally, by addressing the gap of knowledge of ethnomedicinal, pharmacological
and toxicological reports of oleander, the current review is expected to pave the
way to address the differential pharmaco-toxicological effects of oleander.
