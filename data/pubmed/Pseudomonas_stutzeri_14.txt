Purpose: Selenium nanoparticles (SeNP) have several applications in the field of 
biotechnology, including their use as anti-cancer drugs. The purpose of the
present study is to analyze the efficacy of green synthesis on the preparation of
SeNP and its effect on their anti-cancer properties.
Methods: A bacterial strain isolated from a freshwater source was shown to
efficiently synthesize SeNP with potential therapeutic properties. The quality
and stability of the NP were studied by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray
diffraction, zeta-potential and FTIR analysis. A cost-effective medium
formulation from biowaste having 6% banana peel extract enriched with 0.25 mM
tryptophan was used to synthesize the NP. The NP after optimization was used to
analyze their anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic activity. For this purpose, first,
the cytotoxicity of the NP against cancer cells was analyzed by MTT assay and
then chorioallantoic membrane assay was performed to assess anti-angiogenic
activity. Further, cell migration assay and clonogenic inhibition assay were
performed to test the anti-tumor properties of SeNP. To assess the cytotoxicity
of SeNP on healthy RBC, hemolysis assay was performed.
Results: The strain identified as Pseudomonas stutzeri (MH191156) produced
phenazine carboxylic acid, which aids the conversion of Se oxyanions to reduced
NP state, resulting in particles in the size range of 75 nm to 200 nm with
improved stability and quality of SeNP, as observed by zeta (ξ) potential of the 
particles which was found to be -46.2 mV. Cytotoxicity of the SeNP was observed
even at low concentrations such as 5 µg/mL against cervical cancer cell line, ie,
HeLa cells. Further, neovascularization was inhibited by upto 30 % in CAMs of
eggs coinoculated with SeNp when compared with untreated controls, indicating
significant anti-angiogenic activity of SeNP. The NP also inhibited the
invasiveness of HeLa cells as observed by decreased cell migration and clonogenic
proliferation. These observations indicate significant anti-tumor and
anti-angiogenic activity of the SeNP in cervical cancer cells.
Conclusion: P. stutzeri (MH191156) is an efficient source of Se NP production
with potential anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor properties, particularly against
cervical cancer cells.
