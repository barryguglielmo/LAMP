Hafnia alvei H4 is a bacterium subject to regulation by a N-acyl-l-homoserine
lactone (AHL)-mediated quorum sensing system and is closely related to the
corruption of instant sea cucumber. Studying the effect of Hafnia alvei H4 quorum
sensing regulatory genes on AHLs is necessary for the quality and preservation of
instant sea cucumber. In this study, the draft genome of H. alvei H4, which
comprises a single chromosome of 4,687,151 bp, was sequenced and analyzed and the
types of AHLs were analyzed employing thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and high
resolution triple quadrupole liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS).
Then the wild-type strain of H. alvei H4 and the luxI/R double mutant (ΔluxIR)
were compared by transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq). The results indicate that
the incomplete genome sequence revealed the presence of one quorum-sensing (QS)
gene set, designated as lasI/expR. Three major AHLs, N-hexanoyl-L-homoserine
lactone (C6-HSL), N-butyryl-L-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL), and
N-(3-oxo-octanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C8-HSL) were found, with C6-HSL
being the most abundant. C6-HSL was not detected in the culture of the luxI
mutant (ΔluxI) and higher levels of C4-HSL was found in the culture of the luxR
mutant (ΔluxR), which suggested that the luxR gene may have a positive effect on 
C4-HSL production. It was also found that AHL and QS genes are closely related in
the absence of luxIR double deletion. The results of this study can further
elucidate at the genetic level that luxI and luxR genes are involved in the
regulation of AHL.
