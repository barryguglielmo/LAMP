OBJECTIVE: Multiple implantations of the implant healing abutment (IHA) could
adversely impact its surface properties in vivo. Furthermore, the effect of
sterilization and reuse of the IHA on soft tissue viability and bacterial
contamination has not been extensively studied. The goal of this study was to
perform an in vitro analysis of mammalian cell viability and bacterial adhesion
on the surfaces of retrieved IHA after single and multiple implantations and
repetitive cycles of sterilization.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: IHA surface morphology was studied using optical
microscopy. Cell viability of gingival fibroblasts (HGF-1) and oral keratinocytes
(HOKg) in indirect contact with IHAs was assessed for 3 and 7 days. Immersion in 
bacterial culture was performed with a polyculture of Streptococcus species for 3
days and Streptococcus species with Fusobacterium nucleatum for 7 days.
RESULTS: IHAs exhibited signs of surface damage even after a single exposure to
the oral cavity. Fibroblasts did not show a significant preference towards
control IHAs over used IHAs, whereas keratinocytes exhibited a significant
decrease in viability when exposed to IHAs after multiple implantation cycles as 
compared with controls. Adherent bacterial count increased with increasing number
of IHA implantations for both polycultures.
CONCLUSIONS: Reusing of IHAs in vivo promoted surface degradation in addition to 
adversely impacting host cell viability and oral bacterial attachment in vitro.
These findings show IHA reuse might potentially affect its clinical performance.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Careful consideration should be taken when reusing IHAs in
patients because this practice can result in permanent surface changes that might
affect soft tissue integration during the healing period and promote bacterial
colonization.
