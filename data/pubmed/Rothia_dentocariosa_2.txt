Recently, there have been several advances in the field of adult congenital heart
disease, such as the percutaneous pulmonic valve implantation (PPVI) to treat
right ventricular outflow obstruction. Complications from this technique are
seldom but essential to understand. We present a case of a 37-year-old Caucasian 
male with complicated congenital heart disease, including prior Melody valve
implantation, who presented to our hospital with recurrent episodes of pneumonia 
of two months duration. He was diagnosed with prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE)
from an unusual organism, Rothia dentocariosa. He eventually underwent surgical
replacement of the infected valve. Our report is the first case of Melody valve
endocarditis due to Rothia dentocariosa reported from the United States.
