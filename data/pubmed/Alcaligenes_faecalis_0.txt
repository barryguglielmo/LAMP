This study aims to screen bacterial isolates from Olabisi Onabanjo University
Farmland for antibacterial activity against pathogenic microorganisms. Agar well 
diffusion method was used. Isolates were identified molecularly. Chi-square test 
revealed significant association between isolates, antibacterial activity with
likelihood p-value = 0.000 and 5% significant level. Six among thirty-five
isolates exhibited antibacterial activity against the test pathogenic species. A 
greater antibacterial activity (50 % inhibition) was observed in Lysinibacillus
sphearicus strain PRE16. It inhibited the growth of Bacillus subtilis,
Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli by 23.00 ± 2.00, 18.00 ± 2.00 and
20.00 ± 4.00 respectively. DNA sequencing revealed antagonist isolates as
Bacillus sp. BCN2, Brochothrix thermosphacta strain P30C4, Bacillus aryabhattai
strain KNUC205, Alcaligenes faecalis strain KEM24, Bacillus arsenicus strain
CSD05 and Lysinibacillus sphaericus strain PRE16. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 
close relatedness of most isolates with Bacillus species strains. These strains
are suggested to be effective for the discovery of new antibacterial agents.
