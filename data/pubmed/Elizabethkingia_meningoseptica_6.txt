Insects host a highly diverse microbiome, which plays a crucial role in insect
life. However, the composition and diversity of microbiomes associated with
Neotropical freshwater insects is virtually unknown. In addition, the extent to
which diversification of this microbiome is associated with host phylogenetic
divergence remains to be determined. Here, we present the first comprehensive
analysis of bacterial communities associated with six closely related species of 
Neotropical water striders in Panama. We used comparative phylogenetic analyses
to assess associations between dominant bacterial linages and phylogenetic
divergence among species of water striders. We found a total of 806 16S rRNA
amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), with dominant bacterial taxa belonging to the 
phyla Proteobacteria (76.87%) and Tenericutes (19.51%). Members of the α- (e.g., 
Wolbachia) and γ- (e.g., Acinetobacter, Serratia) Proteobacteria, and Mollicutes 
(e.g., Spiroplasma) were predominantly shared across species, suggesting the
presence of a core microbiome in water striders. However, some bacterial lineages
(e.g., Fructobacillus, Fluviicola and Chryseobacterium) were uniquely associated 
with different water strider species, likely representing a distinctive feature
of each species' microbiome. These findings indicate that both host identity and 
environmental context are important drivers of microbiome diversity in water
striders. In addition, they suggest that diversification of the microbiome is
associated with diversification in water striders. Although more research is
needed to establish the evolutionary consequences of host-microbiome interaction 
in water striders, our findings support recent work highlighting the role of
bacterial community host-microbiome codiversification.
