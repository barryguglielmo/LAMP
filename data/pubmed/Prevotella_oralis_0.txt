OBJECTIVES: Patients with Crohn's disease often produce antibodies against
flagellated intestinal bacteria. There are mixed data as to whether such
antibodies are present in patients with spondyloarthritis. Our objectives were to
evaluate for the presence of antibodies against intestinal organisms in children 
with enthesitis related arthritis (ERA).
METHODS: Children with ERA and healthy controls were recruited at three sites.
Sera were plated on a nitrocellulose array and incubated with labelled antibodies
to human IgA and IgG.
RESULTS: At UAB, patients and controls had similar antibody levels against the
majority of the bacteria selected, with the exception of increased IgA antibodies
among ERA patients against Prevotella oralis (1231 [IQR 750, 2566] versus 706
[IQR 428, 1106], p = .007.) These findings were partially validated at a second
but not at a third site.
CONCLUSIONS: ERA patients may produce increased IgA antibodies against P. oralis.
The possible significance of this finding bears further exploration.
