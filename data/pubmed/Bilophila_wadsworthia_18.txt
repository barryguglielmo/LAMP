BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a systemic disease clinically defined by 
the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the brain. While alterations in the
gut microbiome composition have been reported in PD, their functional
consequences remain unclear. Herein, we addressed this question by an analysis of
stool samples from the Luxembourg Parkinson's Study (n = 147 typical PD cases,
n = 162 controls).
RESULTS: All individuals underwent detailed clinical assessment, including
neurological examinations and neuropsychological tests followed by self-reporting
questionnaires. Stool samples from these individuals were first analysed by 16S
rRNA gene sequencing. Second, we predicted the potential secretion for 129
microbial metabolites through personalised metabolic modelling using the
microbiome data and genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of human gut microbes.
Our key results include the following. Eight genera and seven species changed
significantly in their relative abundances between PD patients and healthy
controls. PD-associated microbial patterns statistically depended on sex, age,
BMI, and constipation. Particularly, the relative abundances of Bilophila and
Paraprevotella were significantly associated with the Hoehn and Yahr staging
after controlling for the disease duration. Furthermore, personalised metabolic
modelling of the gut microbiomes revealed PD-associated metabolic patterns in the
predicted secretion potential of nine microbial metabolites in PD, including
increased methionine and cysteinylglycine. The predicted microbial pantothenic
acid production potential was linked to the presence of specific non-motor
symptoms.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that PD-associated alterations of the gut
microbiome can translate into substantial functional differences affecting host
metabolism and disease phenotype.
