Heparinase I (Hep I) specifically degrades heparin to oligosaccharide or
unsaturated disaccharide and has been widely used in preparation of low molecular
weight heparin (LMWH). In this work, a novel Hep I from Bacteroides eggerthii VPI
T5-42B-1 was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The enzyme 
has specific activity of 480 IU·mg-1 at the optimal temperature and pH of 30 °C
and pH 7.5, and the Km and Vmax were 3.6 mg·mL-1 and 647.93 U·mg-1, respectively.
The Hep I has good stability with t1/2 values of 350 and 60 min at 30 and 37 °C, 
respectively. And it showed a residual relative activity of 70.8% after 21 days
incubation at 4 °C. Substrate docking study revealed that Lys99, Arg101, Gln241, 
Lys270, Asn275, and Lys292 were mainly involved in the substrate binding of Hep
I. The shorter hydrogen bonds formed between heparin and these residues suggested
the higher specific activity of BeHep I. And the minimum conformational entropy
value of 756 J·K-1 provides an evidence for the improved stability of this
enzyme. This Hep I could be of interest in the industrial preparation of LMWH for
its high specific activity and good stability.
