BACKGROUND: Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthritis and involvement is commonly
seen in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA). Therapy includes conservative
measures, but also includes intraarticular corticosteroid injections (IASI) and
systemic immunosuppressive therapy. Despite aggressive medical therapy, some
patients develop arthritic changes and frank TMJ ankylosis that can result in
persistent pain and limitation in range of motion (ROM). A surgical option is
prosthetic TMJ replacement with concurrent correction of dentofacial deformities,
which can be performed simultaneously. The objective of this study was to
evaluate the outcomes of prosthetic TMJ replacement in a cohort of adolescent
females with JIA and severe TMJ involvement.
METHODS: This is a retrospective case series that took place at one tertiary care
center. Patients with a diagnosis of JIA who also underwent alloplastic TMJ
replacement were identified through electronic medical record system (EMR) and
reviewed. Chart review included analysis of all documents in the EMR, including
demographic data, JIA history, surgical complications, ROM of TMJ measured by
maximal incisal opening in millimeters (mm) and TMJ pain scores (4-point Likert
scale: none, mild, moderate, severe) obtained pre- and postoperatively.
RESULTS: Five female patients, ages 15-17 year when TMJ replacement was
performed, had nine total joints replaced with a post-operative follow-up period 
of 12-30 months. All patients had polyarticular, seronegative JIA and were
treated with IASI and multiple immunosuppressive therapies without resolution of 
TMJ symptoms. One patient had bilateral TMJ ankylosis. Three of the five patients
demonstrated significant dentofacial deformities, and all underwent simultaneous 
or staged orthognathic surgery. All patients had improvement in TMJ pain with
most (80%) reporting no pain, and all had similar or improved ROM of their TMJ
postoperatively. There was one delayed postoperative infection with Cutibacterium
Acnes that presented 15 months after surgery and required removal and
reimplantation of prosthesis.
CONCLUSION: The sequelae of TMJ arthritis and involvement from JIA in the
adolescent population can be difficult to treat. Current medical therapy can be
successful, however, in select cases that develop chronic changes in the TMJ
despite extensive medical therapy, early results show that prosthetic joint
replacement maybe a reasonable surgical option. With prosthetic joint replacement
pain levels were reduced and range of motion was maintained or improved for all
patients.
