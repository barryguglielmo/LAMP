Context: Shigella is a common cause of bacillary dysentery. Although it is
reported worldwide, the majority of the infections are seen in developing
countries with Shigella flexneri being the most common isolate. Prevalence of
Shigella species and their antibiotic susceptibility profiles vary according to
geographic area and season.
Aims: In the present study, the epidemiology and antimicrobial profile of
Shigella from stool samples received at our hospital for a period of 12 years
(January 2006 to December 2017) was evaluated.
Subjects and Methods: A total of 4578 stool samples were collected from the cases
of acute gastroenteritis and diarrhoea. Samples were processed for culture and
sensitivity according to standard microbiological techniques. The presumptive
identification of Shigella species was done using standard conventional
biochemical tests and confirmed using antisera.
Results: A total of 189 (4.2%) samples yielded Shigella spp. Isolation of
Shigella spp. were more frequent from males (58.2%). S. flexneri was the
commonest species isolated (47.6%) followed by Shigella sonnei(11.6%), Shigella
dysenteriae (4.2%) and Shigella boydii (2.1%). Non-typeable Shigella was commonly
recovered. The isolates showed high resistance to ampicillin (76.7%) and
co-trimoxazole (75%) while highest susceptibility was observed to ceftriaxone
(79.2%).
Conclusions: S. flexneri was the most prevalent species isolated at this centre. 
Shigella isolates from the study showed alarming resistance to recommended
antibiotics. Non-typeable Shigella accounted for 34.4% isolates. Molecular
discrimination between Shigella and Escherichia coli is essential.
