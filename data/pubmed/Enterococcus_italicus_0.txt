Camel milk has significant economic value and is an important food in the region 
of Alxa Left Banner of Inner Mongolia. Fifteen fresh camel milk samples were
collected from domesticated camels in a pasture of Alxa Left Banner. The
physicochemical properties and bacterial diversity of camel milk samples were
analyzed. The average values of fat, total protein, nonfat milk solids, acidity, 
and density were 4.40%, 3.87%, 9.50%, 16.95°T, and 1.02 g/cm3, respectively. The 
bacterial microbiota of the collected fresh camel milk was investigated using
PacBio single-molecule real-time (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA)
sequencing. The camel milk microbiota was highly diverse and comprised 8,513
operational taxonomic units belonging to 32 phyla, 377 genera, and 652 species.
The major phyla included Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Deinococcus-Thermus,
Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria. A small number of lactic acid bacteria
sequences were detected, representing the species Streptococcus thermophilus,
Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus lactis, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides. A
total of 72 strains of lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified from 15 
samples, including Lactobacillus paracasei, Enterococcus italicus, Enterococcus
durans, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Weissella confusa, and Enterococcus
faecium. These results confirm that fresh camel milk has a high bacterial
diversity and is a valuable natural resource for isolation of novel lactic acid
bacteria.
