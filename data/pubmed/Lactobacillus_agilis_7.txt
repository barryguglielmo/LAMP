High dietary levels of molybdenum (MO) can negatively affect productive
performances and health status of laying hens, while tea polyphenol (TP) can
mitigate the negative impact of high MO exposure. However, our understanding of
the changes induced by TP on MO challenged layers performances and oxidative
status, and on the microbiota, remains limited. The aim of the present study was 
to better understand host (performances and redox balance) and microbiota
responses in MO-challenged layers with dietary TP. In this study, 200 Lohmann
laying hens (65-week-old) were randomly allocated in a 2 Ã— 2 factorial design to 
receive a diet with or without MO (0 or 100 mg/kg), and supplemented with either 
0 or 600 mg/kg TP. The results indicate that 100 mg/kg MO decreased egg
production (p = 0.03), while dietary TP increased egg production in MO challenged
layers (p < 0.01). Egg yolk color was decreased by high MO (p < 0.01), while
dietary TP had no effect on yolk color (p > 0.05). Serum alanine transaminase
(ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and malonaldehyde (MDA) concentration
were increased by high MO, while total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), xanthine
oxidase (XOD) activity, glutathione s-transferase (GSH-ST), and glutathione
concentration in serum were decreased (p < 0.05). Dietary TP was able to reverse 
the increasing effect of MO on ALT and AST (p < 0.05). High MO resulted in higher
MO levels in serum, liver, kidney, and egg, but it decreased Cu and Se content in
serum, liver, and egg (p < 0.05). The Fe concentration in liver, kidney, and eggs
was significantly lower in MO supplementation groups (p < 0.05). High MO levels
in the diet led to lower Firmicutes and higher Proteobacteria abundance, whereas 
dietary TP alone and/or in high MO treatment increased the Firmicutes abundance
and the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio at phylum level. High MO increased the
abundance of Proteobacteria (phylum), Deltaproteobacteria (class), Mytococcales
(order), and Nanocystaceae (family), whereas dietary TP promoted the enrichment
of Lactobacillus agilis (species). Dietary TP also enhanced the enrichment of
Bacilli (class), Lactobacillates (order), Lactobacillus (family), and
Lactobacillus gasseri (species). Microbiota analysis revealed differentially
enriched microbial compositions in the cecum caused by MO and TP, which might be 
responsible for the protective effect of dietary TP during a MO challenge.
