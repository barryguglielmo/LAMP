Gastrointestinal helminth infection likely affects the gut microbiome, in turn
affecting host health. To investigate the effect of intestinal parasite status on
the gut microbiome, parasitic infection surveys were conducted in communities in 
Nan Province, Thailand. In total, 1047 participants submitted stool samples for
intestinal parasite examination, and 391 parasite-positive cases were identified,
equating to an infection prevalence of 37.3%. Intestinal protozoan species were
less prevalent (4.6%) than helminth species. The most prevalent parasite was the 
minute intestinal fluke Haplorchis taichui (35.9%). Amplicon sequencing of 16S
rRNA was conducted to investigate the gut microbiome profiles of H.
taichui-infected participants compared with those of parasite-free participants. 
Prevotella copri was the dominant bacterial operational taxonomic unit (OTU) in
the study population. The relative abundance of three bacterial taxa,
Ruminococcus, Roseburia faecis and Veillonella parvula, was significantly
increased in the H. taichui-infected group. Parasite-negative group had higher
bacterial diversity (α diversity) than the H. taichui-positive group. In
addition, a significant difference in bacterial community composition (β
diversity) was found between the two groups. The results suggest that H. taichui 
infection impacts the gut microbiome profile by reducing bacterial diversity and 
altering bacterial community structure in the gastrointestinal tract.
