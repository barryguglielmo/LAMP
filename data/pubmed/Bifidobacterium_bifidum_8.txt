In inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), the therapeutic benefit and mucosal healing
from specific probiotics may relate to the modulation of dendritic cells (DCs).
Herein, we assessed the immunomodulatory effects of four probiotic strains
including Lactobacillus salivarius, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bacillus coagulans
and Bacillus subtilis natto on the expression of co-stimulatory molecules,
cytokine production and gene expression of signal-transducing receptors in DCs
from IBD patients. Human monocyte-derived DCs from IBD patients and healthy
controls were exposed to four probiotic strains. The expression of co-stimulatory
molecules was assessed and supernatants were analyzed for anti-inflammatory
cytokines. The gene expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs), IL-12p40 and
integrin αvβ8 were also analyzed. CD80 and CD86 were induced by most probiotic
strains in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients whereas only B. bifidum induced CD80 
and CD86 expression in Crohn's disease (CD) patients. IL-10 and TGF-β production 
was increased in a dose-independent manner while TLR expression was decreased by 
all probiotic bacteria except B. bifidum in DCs from UC patients. TLR-4 and TLR-9
expression was significantly downregulated while integrin ß8 was significantly
increased in the DCs from CD patients. IL-12p40 expression was only significantly
downregulated in DCs from CD patients. Our findings point to the general
beneficial effects of probiotics in DC immunomodulation and indicate that
probiotic bacteria favorably modulate the expression of co-stimulatory molecules,
proinflammatory cytokines and TLRs in DCs from IBD patients.
