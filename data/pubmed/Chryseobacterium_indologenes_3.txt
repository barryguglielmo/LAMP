Infections caused by metallo-β-lactamase (MBL)-producing bacteria are emerging
and carry a significant impact on patients' outcome. MBL producers are spread
worldwide, both in community and hospital setting, with increasingly reported
epidemic clusters and the search for MBL inhibitors is an important topic for
public health. MBLs are zinc-dependent enzymes whose functioning can be hampered 
by zinc chelators. We evaluated the potential of six zinc chelators (disulfiram, 
nitroxoline, 5-amino-8-hydroxyquinoline,
1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid [DOTA], cyclam, and
N,N,N',N'-tetrakis (2-pyridymethyl) ethylenediamine [TPEN]) in restoring
carbapenem activity against MBL producers. Zinc chelators alone or in combination
with meropenem against MBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, Chryseobacterium
indologenes, Elizabethkingia meningoseptica, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia
isolates were tested in vitro and in vivo (Galleria mellonella). In vitro
experiments showed a synergistic activity between TPEN and meropenem toward all
the strains. Nitroxoline alone retained activity against S. maltophilia, C.
indologenes, and E. meningoseptica. In vivo experiments showed that TPEN or
nitroxoline in combination with meropenem increased survival in larvae infected
with E. meningoseptica, S. maltophilia, and K. pneumoniae. Based on our data,
zinc chelators are potential carbapenem adjuvants molecules (restoring carbapenem
activity) against MBL-sustained infections and could represent an interesting
option for infections induced by these microorganisms.
