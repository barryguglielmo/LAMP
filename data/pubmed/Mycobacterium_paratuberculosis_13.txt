Paratuberculosis (pTB), also known as Johne's disease (JD), is a contagious,
chronic, and granulomatous inflammatory disease of the intestines of ruminants
which is caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) infection,
resulting in billions of dollars in economic losses worldwide. Since, currently, 
no effective cure is available for MAP infection, it is important to explore the 
genetic variants that affect the host MAP susceptibility. The aim of this study
was to analyze a potential association between EDN2 synonymous gene mutations
(rs110287192, rs109651404 and rs136707411), that modifies susceptibility to pTB. 
EDN2 rs110287192, rs109651404 and rs136707411 mutations were genotyped in 68
infected and 753 healthy animals from East Anatolian Red crossbred, Anatolian
Black crossbred and Holstein breed cattle by using Custom TaqMan SNP Genotyping
Assays. For pTB status, serum antibody levels S/P ≥ 1.0 were assessed in carriers
of the different EDN2 genotypes. EDN2 rs110287192 mutation showed a significant
association with bovine pTB (adj. p < 0.05). For rs110287192 locus, the odd
ratios for GG and TG genotypes versus TT genotypes were 1.73; (95% CI =
0.34-8.59) and 0.53 (95% CI = 0.12-2.37) respectively, which indicated that
proportion of TG heterozygotes were significantly higher in control animals as
compared to pTB animals. On the other hand, while rs136707411 mutation showed a
suggestive association with pTB status in the examined cattle population (nominal
p < 0.05); no association was detected between rs109651404 genotypes and pTB
status. Selecting animals against rs110287192-GG genotype may decrease the risk
of pTB in cattle of the Bos taurus taurus subspecies.
