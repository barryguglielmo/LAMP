Strains within the Rhodococcus genus have the ability to endure a range of
recalcitrant compounds and metabolise a variety of pollutants. As a result there 
is increasing interest in these robust prokaryotes for their applications in
bioremediation of contaminated environments and bioconversion of industrial
wastes. In this announcement we present the draft genome sequence of R.
qingshengii CS98, a soil isolate from Japan with the demonstrated ability to
accumulate both stable and radioactive caesium.
