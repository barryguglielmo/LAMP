Pineapple stem starch (PS) was evaluated for its suitability as a new starch
source in concentrate for fattening cattle, based on the growth performance,
blood profile, and rumen parameters of 36 steers in a 206-day feeding study. PS
was formulated as a 40% concentrate and fed with forage in comparison with ground
corn (GC) and ground cassava (CA) formulated at the same level. PS feeding
improved weight gain and feed conversion ratio without affecting feed intake. PS 
did not obviously influence blood lipid profiles throughout the experiment.
Ruminal concentration of total short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) increased with PS
without affecting SCFA composition throughout the feeding study. Rumen amylolytic
group, especially Ruminococcus bromii, was dominant in the rumen microbial
community, and showed increased abundance by PS feeding throughout the
experiment. These results clearly indicate the potential of PS as a useful starch
source for fattening cattle in terms of rumen fermentation and growth
performance.
