The rapid increase in the number of worldwide human infections caused by the
extremely antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogen Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is
cause for concern. An alternative treatment solution in the post-antibiotic era
is phage therapy, the use of bacteriophages to selectively kill bacterial
pathogens. In this study, the novel bacteriophage AXL3 (vB_SmaS-AXL_3) was
isolated from soil and characterized. Host range analysis using a panel of 29
clinical S. maltophilia isolates shows successful infection of five isolates and 
electron microscopy indicates that AXL3 is a member of the Siphoviridae family.
Complete genome sequencing and analysis reveals a 47.5 kb genome predicted to
encode 65 proteins. Functionality testing suggests AXL3 is a virulent phage and
results show that AXL3 uses the type IV pilus, a virulence factor on the cell
surface, as its receptor across its host range. This research identifies a novel 
virulent phage and characterization suggests that AXL3 is a promising phage
therapy candidate, with future research examining modification through genetic
engineering to broaden its host range.
