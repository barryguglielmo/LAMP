This study aimed to determine the impact of fermenting the cereal fraction of the
diet (Cferm) and enzyme supplementation (ENZ) on the bacterial composition of the
feed, nutrient digestibility, pig growth, feed efficiency (FE), intestinal
volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations and intestinal microbiota composition. A
total of 252 grow-finisher pigs (~ 40.4 kg; 7 pigs/pen) were randomly allocated
to 4 diets in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement for 55d. The diets were: (1) fresh
liquid feed (Fresh); (2) Cferm liquid feed (Ferm); (3) Fresh + ENZ and (4)
Ferm + ENZ. Cferm increased total tract nutrient digestibility, reduced caecal
butyrate and propionate concentrations, and increased average daily gain (ADG).
ENZ increased ileal and total tract nutrient digestibility, reduced caecal
isobutyrate and propionate concentrations, and improved FE. Bacterial taxa
positively correlated with pig growth (Lactobacillus kisonensis in the ileum and 
Roseburia faecis in the caecum) were more abundant in pigs fed ENZ diets, whereas
most of the ileal bacterial taxa negatively correlated with growth (Megasphaera, 
Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus) had lower abundance in pigs fed Cferm diets.
In conclusion, Cferm increased ADG and ENZ improved FE, with these improvements
possibly mediated by increased nutrient digestibility, and beneficial modulation 
of the intestinal microbiota.
