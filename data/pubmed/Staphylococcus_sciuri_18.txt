OBJECTIVES: MRSA is a known pathogen that affects horses. We investigated an
equine MRSA isolate for potential antimicrobial resistance genes, classified the 
staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) and identified the
strain-specific dissemination in the horse community based on WGS.
METHODS: WGS, using short-read sequencing, and subsequent long-read sequencing by
hybrid assembly, was conducted to obtain a complete genome sequence. Pairwise
sequence alignment of relative SCCmec sequences and core-genome phylogenetic
analysis were performed to highlight transmission routes of the SCCmec and MRSA
strain-specific lineages.
RESULTS: In 2018, we isolated the MRSA JRA307 strain from the pus of a wound on a
racehorse and the complete genome sequence suggests that it is a clinically
relevant pvl-negative ST1-t127 MRSA that harbours both mecA and mecC on
SCCmec-307. SCCmec-307 exhibited marked sequence identity to the previously
reported SCCmec-mecC in the Staphylococcus sciuri GVGS2 strain isolated from
cattle. The JRA307 mecC gene was classified as a mecC allotype of S. sciuri
rather than that of Staphylococcus aureus.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the complete genome sequence of equine isolate
JRA307, which is a clinically relevant MRSA harbouring mecA and mecC on
SCCmec-307. The finding of mecC MRSA suggests a possible SCCmec transmission
between distinct staphylococcal species. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first report of mecC detection in Japan.
