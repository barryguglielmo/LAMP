BACKGROUND: Isolated aortic infection is rare and is typically associated with an
underlying aortic aneurysm or a prosthetic aortic graft.
CASE SUMMARY: A 38-year-old woman was admitted with symptoms of left upper limb
ischaemia and had imaging findings suggestive of thrombus extending from the
ascending aorta into the subclavian and brachial arteries. She underwent
evacuation of the aortic masses and replacement of the ascending aorta.
Citrobacter koseri was isolated from the excised tissue and the patient received 
6 weeks of appropriate antibiotic therapy.
DISCUSSION: This is an unusual case of acute upper limb ischaemia due to a mass
infected with Citrobacter koseri in the ascending aorta without heart valve
involvement.
