The Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex (SBSEC) and possibly
Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius (Sii) are associated with human and 
animal diseases. Sii predominate in spontaneously fermented milk products with
unknown public health effects. Sii/SBSEC prevalence data from West Africa in
correlation with milk transformation practices are limited. Northern Côte
d'Ivoire served as study area due to its importance in milk production and
consumption and to link a wider Sudano-Sahelian pastoral zone of cross-border
trade. We aimed to describe the cow milk value chain and determine Sii/SBSEC
prevalence with a cross-sectional study. Dairy production practices were
described as non-compliant with basic hygiene standards. The system is influenced
by secular sociocultural practices and environmental conditions affecting product
properties. Phenotypic and molecular analyses identified SBSEC in 27/43 (62.8%)
fermented and 26/67 (38.8%) unfermented milk samples. Stratified by collection
stage, fermented milk at producer and vendor levels featured highest SBSEC
prevalence of 71.4% and 63.6%, respectively. Sii with 62.8% and 38.8% as well as 
Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus with 7.0% and 7.5% were the
predominant SBSEC species identified among fermented and unfermented milk
samples, respectively. The population structure of Sii/SBSEC isolates seems to
reflect evolving novel dairy-adapted, non-adapted and potentially pathogenic
lineages. Northern Côte d'Ivoire was confirmed as area with high Sii presence in 
dairy products. The observed production practices and the high diversity of
Sii/SBSEC supports in-depth investigations on Sii ecology niche, product safety
and related technology in the dairy value chain potentially affecting large
population groups across sub-Saharan Africa.
