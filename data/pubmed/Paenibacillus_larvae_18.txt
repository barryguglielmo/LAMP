Infectious (or Communicable) diseases are not only the past but also the present 
problem in developing as well as developed countries. It is caused by various
pathogenic microbes like fungi, bacteria, parasites and virus etc. The medicinal 
plants and nano-silver have been used against the pathogenic microbes. Herbal
medicines are generally used for healthcare because they have low price and
wealthy source of antimicrobial properties. Like medicinal plants, silver
nanoparticles also have emergent applications in biomedical fields due to their
immanent therapeutic performance. Here, we also explore the various plant parts
such as bark, stem, leaf, fruit and seed against Gram negative and Gram-positive 
bacteria, using different solvents for extraction i.e. methanol, ethyl acetate,
chloroform, acetone, n. hexane, butanol, petroleum ether and benzene. Since
ancient to date most of the countries have been used herbal medicines, but in
Asia, some medicinal plants are commonly used in rural and backward areas as a
treatment for infectious diseases. In this review, we provide simple information 
about medicinal plants and Silver nanoparticles with their potentialities such as
antiviral, bactericidal and fungicidal. Additionally, the present review to
highlights the versatile applications of medicinal plants against honey bee
pathogen such as fungi (Ascosphaera apis), mites (Varroa spp. and Tropilaelaps
sp.), bacteria (Melissococcus plutonius Paenibacillus larvae), and microsporidia 
(Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae). In conclusion, promising nonchemical (plant
extracts) are innocuous to adult bees. So, we strongly believed that this effort 
was made to evaluate the status of medicinal plants researches globally.
