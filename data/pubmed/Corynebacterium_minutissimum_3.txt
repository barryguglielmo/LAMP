Erythrasma is a common skin disorder caused by bacteria. It was first described
in 1859 by Burchardt, who thought the etiology was fungal. In 1862, Burchardt's
teacher, Von Barensprung coined the term erythrasma and named the bacteria
Microsporum minutissimum. Today, erythrasma is known to be caused by
Corynebacterium minutissimum, which is a gram-positive, catalase-positive,
non-spore-forming organism. Erythrasma usually causes infection of the
intertriginous parts of the body and causes itching, scaling, and erythema. It is
often asymptomatic. [1][2]
