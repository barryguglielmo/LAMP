Brevibacillus species are environmental organisms that are rarely implicated as
human pathogens. We present the case of postsurgical Brevibacillus brevis
bacterial meningitis and an associated bacteremia after debulking surgery for a
newly diagnosed pilocytic astrocytoma in a 19-year-old woman. The patient
experienced clinical cure with a 4-week course of vancomycin, but her
postinfectious course was complicated by the development of a pseudomeningocele
that required surgical repair. To our knowledge, this is the first described case
of a central nervous system infection caused by Brevibacillus brevis in the
literature.
