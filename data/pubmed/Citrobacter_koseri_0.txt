BACKGROUND: Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) are emerging as a
worldwide threat. Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are considered a reservoir
for CPE and play a central role in transmission to acute care hospitals. We
investigated the CPE positivity in patients exposed to CPE in LTCFs. Furthermore,
we analyzed the CPE positivity rates in the environment exposed to CPE.
METHODS: We collected rectal swab specimens from patients residing in LTCFs who
were exposed to CPE. Environmental sampling was performed by infection control
practitioners from sites classified as patient private space, common space in the
patient room, common space other than patient rooms, and nursing station. Each
sample was cultured on a Chrom Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) agar for
CPE screening. The positive isolates were subjected to a polymerase chain
reaction to identify the presence of blaKPC, blaVIM, blaIMP, blaOXA-48, and
blaNDM and determine CPE genotype.
RESULTS: From 65 index cases, a total of 24 hospitals and 481 patients were
enrolled; 414 patients who had resided in the same patient room as a patient with
confirmed CPE and 67 patients who were newly admitted to that patient room. A
total of 117 (24.3%) patients were positive for CPE among which 93 (22.5%,
93/414) were already admitted patients and 24 (35.8%, 24/67) were newly admitted 
patients. A total of 163 CPEs were detected and K. pneumoniae (n = 104, 63.8%)
was the most common bacteria followed by Escherichia coli (n = 43, 26.4%) and
Citrobacter koseri (n = 11, 6.7%). Environmental sampling was performed in 24
hospitals and 604 sites. A total of 12 sites (2.0%) were positive for CPE and
sink in the nursing station (n = 6, 4.2%) was the most contaminated space.
CONCLUSION: CPE colonization rates in patients exposed to CPE in LTCFs were
higher than those found in acute care hospitals. Proper infection control
measures for detecting and reducing CPE colonization in patients residing in
LTCFs are required. Newly admitted patients could also be carriers; therefore,
infection control for newly admitted patients also needs to be thorough.
