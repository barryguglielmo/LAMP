Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a mass-produced synthetic polyester
contributing remarkably to the accumulation of solid plastics waste and plastics 
pollution in the natural environments. Recently, bioremediation of plastics waste
using engineered enzymes has emerged as an eco-friendly alternative approach for 
the future plastic circular economy. Here we genetically engineered a
thermophilic anaerobic bacterium, Clostridium thermocellum, to enable the
secretory expression of a thermophilic cutinase (LCC), which was originally
isolated from a plant compost metagenome and can degrade PET at up to 70°C. This 
engineered whole-cell biocatalyst allowed a simultaneous high-level expression of
LCC and conspicuous degradation of commercial PET films at 60°C. After 14 days
incubation of a batch culture, more than 60% of the initial mass of a PET film
(approximately 50 mg) was converted into soluble monomer feedstocks, indicating a
markedly higher degradation performance than previously reported whole-cell-based
PET biodegradation systems using mesophilic bacteria or microalgae. Our findings 
provide clear evidence that, compared to mesophilic species, thermophilic
microbes are a more promising synthetic microbial chassis for developing future
biodegradation processes of PET waste.
