Hexagonal nanocrystalline powders of the non-doped Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 as well as
activated with Ag+ and Eu3+ ions were synthesized by using different wet
chemistry methods. Moreover, the obtained hydroxyapatite was loaded with Ag0, as 
well as nitroimidazole antimicrobials: metronidazole and tinidazole. The
structural properties of the products were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD),
scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) electron microscopy as well as infrared
(IR) and Raman spectroscopy. The photoluminescence properties of the Eu3+ and Ag+
co-doped Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 were characterized via the PL emission, excitation
spectra and the luminescence decay curve. The antimicrobial activity of the
obtained materials against Prevotella bivia and Parabacteroides distasonis was
studied. The cytotoxicity assessment was carried out on the human osteosarcoma
cell line (U2OS) as well as human red blood cells (RBC). The choice of the in
vitro model was based on the fact that U2OS is a cancer cell line derived from
bone tissue which is rich in apatites that play a pivotal role in the
extracellular matrix formation. RBCs are the most abundant blood cells and they
are used as a cell model in the study of biocompatibility of new prepared
biocompounds with potential medical applications. The obtained multifunctional
materials do not exhibit the haemolytic activity, therefore, they could be used
as a promising antimicrobial agent and for anaerobic bacteria.
