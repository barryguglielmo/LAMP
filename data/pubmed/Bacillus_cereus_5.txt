Antibiotic therapy and host cells frequently fail to eliminate invasive bacterial
pathogens due to the emergence of antibiotic resistance, resulting in the relapse
and recurrence of infections. Bacteria evolve various strategies to persist and
survive in epithelial cells, a front-line barrier of host tissues counteracting
invasion; however, it remains unclear how bacteria hijack cellular responses to
promote cytoplasmic survival under antibiotic therapy. Here, it is demonstrated
that extracellular bacteria show invasive behavior and survive in epithelial
cells in both in vivo and in vitro models, to increase antibiotic tolerance. In
turn, sublethal levels of antibiotics increase bacterial invasion through
promoting the production of bacterial virulence factors. Furthermore, antibiotic 
treatments interrupt lysosomal acidification in autophagy due to the internalized
bacteria, using Bacillus cereus and ciprofloxacin as a model. In addition, it is 
found that sublethal levels of ciprofloxacin cause mitochondrial dysfunction and 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation to impair lysosomal vascular tape
ATPase (V-ATPase) to further promote bacterial persistence. Collectively, these
results highlight the potential of host cells mediated antibiotic tolerance,
which markedly compromises antibiotic efficacy and worsens the outcomes of
infection.
