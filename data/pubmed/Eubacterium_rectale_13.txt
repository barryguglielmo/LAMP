acids differently affect microbiota composition in high-cardiometabolic-risk
individuals.

AIMS: Gut microbiota significantly impacts human health and is influenced by
dietary changes. We evaluated the effects of diets naturally rich in polyphenols 
(PP) and/or long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCn3) on microbiota
composition in an ancillary analysis of a randomized controlled trial in
individuals at high cardiometabolic risk.
METHODS: Seventy-eight individuals with high waist circumference and at least one
additional component of the metabolic syndrome were randomized to an isoenergetic
8-week diet: (a) low LCn3 and PP; (b) high LCn3; (c) high PP; or (d) high LCn3
and PP. Microbiota analysis was performed on feces collected before and after the
intervention. DGGE analysis of the predominant bacteria, Eubacterium rectale and 
Blautia coccoides group (Lachnospiraceae, EREC), Clostridium leptum
(Ruminococcaceae, CLEPT), Bacteroides spp., Bifidobacteria, and Lactobacillus
group was performed. A quantitative real-time PCR was performed for the same
group, additionally including Atopobium cluster (Coriobatteriaceae). Before and
after the intervention, participants underwent a 75 g OGTT and a high-fat test
meal to evaluate glucose and lipid response.
RESULTS: Adherence to the four diets was optimal. PP significantly increased
microbial diversity (p = 0.006) and CLEPT (p = 0.015), while it reduced EREC
(p = 0.044). LCn3 significantly increased the numbers of Bifidobacteria
(p = 0.041). Changes in CLEPT numbers correlated with changes in early insulin
secretion (r = 0.263, p = 0.030). Changes in Atopobium numbers correlated with
postprandial triglycerides in plasma (r = 0.266, p = 0.026) and large VLDL
(r = 0.313, p = 0.009), and cholesterol in large VLDL (r = 0.319, p = 0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: Diets naturally rich in PP or LCn3 influenced gut microbiota
composition in individuals at high cardiometabolic risk. These modifications were
associated with changes in glucose/lipid metabolism.
