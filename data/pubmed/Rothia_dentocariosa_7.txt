Rothia dentocariosa is part of the normal human oropharyngeal microflora and is
frequently associated with dental caries and periodontal disease. Invasive
disease has been described essentially in immunocompromised hosts and/or patients
with underlying conditions as predisposing factors. We present a case of an
otherwise healthy 46-years old male with spondylodiscitis caused by this
pathogen. Treatment with ceftriaxone and rifampin was successful. To our
knowledge, this is the first R. dentocariosa spondylodiscitis reported in an
immunocompetent patient, and the second one in the literature overall.
