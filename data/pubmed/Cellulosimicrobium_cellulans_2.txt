This work aims at functional studies of the multienzyme complexes produced by
Oerskovia turbata JCM 3160 and reveal of their subunit structures. The
multienzyme complexes were isolated, enzymatic assayed, the whole genome sequence
was determined in fine scale, and the subunit structure was identified by
Maldi-TOF mass spectrometry. The isolated multienzyme complexes here show similar
particle size with the xylanosomes produced by Cellulosimicrobium cellulans F16, 
have at least two conserved multi-domain proteins, while differ significantly in 
enzymatic activities and low molecular weight subunit compositions. This is the
first report of the enzymatic activities and subunit structures of xylanosome
produced by Oerskovia turbata, providing insights into its diverse capability as 
well as degrading bias on hemicelluloses.
