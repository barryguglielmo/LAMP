This study focused on sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar protein degradation and the
formation of peptides with antioxidant activity by mixed starters (Lactobacillus 
plantarum CD101 and Staphylococcus simulans NJ201). Gel electrophoresis indicated
that the mixed starters can hydrolyze both sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar
proteins, and the concentration of peptides increased (P < .05). Compared with
the control group, using mixed starters led to a significant increase (P < .05)
in the DPPH radical scavenging activity, Fe2+ chelating activity, and ABTS
radical scavenging activity of sarcoplasmic proteins, but demonstrated no
significant difference in myofibrillar proteins. Two hydrophobic fractions (C2,
C5) separated by RP-HPLC in the inoculation groups with sarcoplasmic proteins
showed high DPPH radical scavenging activity (66.60%, 60.50%). Eighteen peptides 
were identified by LC-MS/MS, which mainly arose from triosephosphate isomerase,
creatine kinase M-type, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Hydrophobic
amino acids accounted for a large proportion. Our results indicate that mixed
starters affect proteolytic characterization and contribute to the formation of
peptides with antioxidant capacity in sarcoplasmic proteins.
