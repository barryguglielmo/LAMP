OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine novel alleles and their prevalence in
Streptococcus canis M-like protein (SCM) and to elucidate association of their
alleles with sequence types (STs)/clonal complexes (CCs) and antimicrobial
resistance (AMR) phenotypes/genotypes.
METHODS: We amplified and sequenced scm, by using primers reported by Pinho
recently, for 40 isolates in 2015 and 2017, in which the sequences could not be
determined with conventional primers. Isolates, for which SCM alleles, STs, and
AMR phenotypes/genotypes were previously determined, were included as controls. A
phylogenetic tree of SCM amino acid sequences was constructed. Alleles, based on 
the tree positions with their prevalence, as well as STs/CCs and AMR
phenotypes/genotypes were characterized.
RESULTS: Although one isolate possessed SCM allele type 1, 39 isolates had novel 
allele types 10-15, based on cluster analysis. The 11 and 12 allele types were
firstly found in this study. We designated novel allele types as group II and
non-novel allele types as group I. Prevalence of group II alleles was 29.9% and
16.2% in 2015 and 2017. Prevalent group II types were allele 10 (10.3%), allele
11 (2.7%), and allele 15 (3.3%) through both periods. There was a significant
difference in distribution of STs/CCs between groups I/II SCM populations. We
found significant differences in distribution of macrolide/lincosamide AMR
genotype (7.7% vs. 26.8%) and AMR rates of fluoroquinolone (0% vs. 12.5%) between
the two populations.
CONCLUSION: Our study presents group II scm sequences and their prevalence among 
diseased companion animals in Japan, with association of their alleles with STs.
