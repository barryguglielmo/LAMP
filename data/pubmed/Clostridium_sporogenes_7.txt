Gluten is a cereal protein that is incompletely digested by human proteolytic
enzymes that create immunogenic peptides that accumulate in the gastrointestinal 
tract (GIT). Although both environmental and human bacteria have been shown to
expedite gluten hydrolysis, gluten intolerance is a growing concern. Here we
hypothesize that together with food, we acquire environmental bacteria that could
impact our GIT with gluten-degrading bacteria. Using in vitro gastrointestinal
simulation conditions, we evaluated the capacity of endophytic bacteria that
inhabit root vegetables, potato (Solanum tuberosum), carrot (Daucus sativus),
beet (Beta vulgaris), and topinambur (Jerusalem artichoke) (Helianthus
tuberosus), to resist these conditions and degrade gluten. By 16S rDNA
sequencing, we discovered that bacteria from the families Enterobacteriaceae,
Bacillaceae, and Clostridiaceae most effectively multiply in conditions similar
to the human GIT (microoxic conditions, 37 °C) while utilizing vegetable material
and gluten as nutrients. Additionally, we used stomach simulation (1 h, pH 3) and
intestinal simulation (1 h, bile salts 0.4%) treatments. The bacteria that
survived this treatment retained the ability to degrade gluten epitopes but at
lower levels. Four bacterial strains belonging to species Bacillus pumilus,
Clostridium subterminale, and Clostridium sporogenes isolated from vegetable
roots produced proteases with postproline cleaving activity that successfully
neutralized the toxic immunogenic epitopes. KEY POINTS: • Bacteria from root
vegetables can degrade gluten. • Some of these bacteria can resist conditions
mimicking gastrointestinal tract.
