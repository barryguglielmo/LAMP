Background: Oral commensals contribute to microbe-host symbiosis in periodontal
homeostasis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) as the keystone
pathogen critically accounts for the shift of symbiosis to dysbiosis and
periodontal destruction. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like
receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-mediated
interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is significantly involved in periodontal diseases, and
notably P. gingivalis enables to modulate the induction and expression of NLRP3. 
Whereas, the exact mechanism by which NLRP3 inflammasome is regulated in response
to commensal and pathogenic bacteria remains unclear. Methods: To examine the
expression of IL-1β and NLRPs inflammasome in tissues with severe chronic
periodontitis, and further investigate how Caspase-4-dependent non-canonical
NLRP3 inflammasome pathways functioned during the interactions of Streptococcus
mitis (S. mitis) and P. gingivalis with human THP-1 cells. Results: IL-1β and
NLRP3, NLRP6, NLRP12, and absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasomes are highly
expressed in gingival tissues with severe chronic periodontitis. In human THP-1
cells, P. gingivalis activates the synthesis and secretion of IL-1β to higher
levels than S. mitis. Importantly, NLRP3-, Caspase-1-, and Caspase-4-siRNA
knockdown THP-1 cells treated with P. gingivalis exhibited a lower expression
level of IL-1β as compared to the control cells. In addition, silencing of either
CASP4 or CASP1 can lead to a concurrent or reciprocal decrease in the expression 
of the other. Of note, the IL-1β induction is not affected in the S.
mitis-treated THP-1 cells with the silence of NLRP3, Caspase-1, and Caspase-4
genes. Conclusion: NLRP3/Caspase-4 and NLRP3/Caspase-1 dependent IL-1β production
may crucially contribute to the dysregulated immuno-inflammatory response in
periodontal pathogenesis.
