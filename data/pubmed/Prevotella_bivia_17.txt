Infectious process even at the initial stage after aerosol infection with
Mycobacterium tuberculosis induced rapid changes in vaginal microbiota in mice.
Rapid decrease in both the quantity and diversity of microbiota was noted, and
then, partial recovery of normal flora was observed. Changes in vaginal
microbiota was detected as soon as in 3-7 days after lung infection, while
inflammatory changes appeared by day 35. At the early stage of infection, no
signs of inflammation were observed, neither M. tuberculosis nor its DNA were
detected in mouse genital organs.
