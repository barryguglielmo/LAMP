OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify Acinetobacter spp. strains from
paediatric patients, to determine their genetic relationship, to detect
antibiotic resistance genes and to evaluate the role of efflux pumps in
antibiotic resistance.
METHODS: A total of 54 non-duplicate, non-consecutive Acinetobacter spp. isolates
were collected from paediatric patients. Their genetic relationship, antibiotic
resistance profile, efflux pump activity, antibiotic resistance genes and plasmid
profile were determined.
RESULTS: The isolates were identified as 24 Acinetobacter haemolyticus, 24
Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii (Acb) complex and 1 strain each of
Acinetobacter junii, Acinetobacter radioresistens, Acinetobacter indicus,
Acinetobacter lwoffii, Acinetobacter ursingii and Acinetobacter venetianus. The
24 A. haemolyticus were considered genetically unrelated. One strain was
resistant to carbapenems, two to cephalosporins, two to ciprofloxacin and sixteen
to aminoglycosides. The antibiotic resistance genes blaOXA-214 (29%), blaOXA-215 
(4%), blaOXA-264 (8%), blaOXA-265 (29%), blaNDM-1 (4%), aac(6')-Ig (38%) and the 
novel variants blaOXA-575 (13%), blaTEM-229 (75%), aac(6')-Iga (4%), aac(6')-Igb 
(13%) and aac(6')-Igc (42%) were detected. Among 24 Acb complex, 5 were
multidrug-resistant, carbapenem-resistant strains carrying blaOXA-51 and
blaOXA-23; they were genetically related and had the same plasmid profile. Other 
species were susceptible. In some strains of A. haemolyticus and Acb complex, the
role of RND efflux pumps was evidenced by a decrease in the MICs for cefotaxime, 
amikacin and ciprofloxacin in the presence of an efflux pump inhibitor.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified isolates of A. haemolyticus carrying new
β-lactamase variants and shows for the first time the contribution of efflux
pumps to antibiotic resistance in this species.
