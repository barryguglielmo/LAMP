A Gram-stain-negative, facultative anaerobic, spore-forming, motile, and
rod-shaped bacterium, strain ChDC PVNT-B20T, was isolated from the human
subgingival dental plaque of a gingivitis lesion. Phylogenetic analysis based on 
the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (16S rDNA) showed that the strain belonged to the
genus Paenibacillus. BLAST analysis of 16S rDNA sequence of the strain displayed 
high identity to those of Paenibacillus faecis DSM 23593T (97.7% similarity) and 
Paenibacillus macerans ATCC 8244T (97.6% similarity). Draft genome of strain ChDC
PVNT-B20T was composed of 8,112,407 bp. The DNA G+C content of the strain was
51.3 mol%. Average nucleotide identity values between strain ChDC PVNT-B20T and
P. faecis DSM 23593T or P. macerans ATCC 8244T were 75.71% and 91.5%,
respectively. Genome-to-genome distance values between strain ChDC PVNT-B20T and 
P. faecis DSM 23593T or P. macerans ATCC 8244T were 21.6% (19.3-24.0%) and 44.9% 
(42.3-47.4%), respectively. Major cellular fatty acids of strain ChDC PVNT-B20T
were anteiso-C15:0 (43.4%), C16:0 (16.6%), iso-C16:0 (14.4%), and anteiso-C17:0
(12.4%). The sole respiratory quinone of the strain was menaqinone-7. Major polar
lipids of the strain were phosphatidylglycerol (PG), diphosphatidylglycerol
(DPG), and one unidentified glycolipid (GL). Minor polar lipids were one
unidentified aminolipid (AL), one unidentified phospholipid (PL), and three
unidentified lipids (L1-L3). Based on these results, strain ChDC PVNT-B20T is
considered to represent a novel species of the genus Paenibacillus, for which the
name Paenibacillus oralis sp. nov. is proposed. Type strain is ChDC PVNT-B20T
(= KCOM 3021T = JCM 33462 T).
