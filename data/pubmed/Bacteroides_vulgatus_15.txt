Initial microbial colonization and later succession in the gut of human infants
are linked to health and disease later in life. The timing of the appearance of
the first gut microbiome, and the consequences for the early life metabolome, are
just starting to be defined. Here, we evaluated the gut microbiome, proteome and 
metabolome in 88 African-American newborns using faecal samples collected in the 
first few days of life. Gut bacteria became detectable using molecular methods by
16â€‰h after birth. Detailed analysis of the three most common species, Escherichia
coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacteroides vulgatus, did not suggest a genomic
signature for neonatal gut colonization. The appearance of bacteria was
associated with reduced abundance of approximately 50 human proteins, decreased
levels of free amino acids and an increase in products of bacterial fermentation,
including acetate and succinate. Using flux balance modelling and in vitro
experiments, we provide evidence that fermentation of amino acids provides a
mechanism for the initial growth of E. coli, the most common early colonizer,
under anaerobic conditions. These results provide a deep characterization of the 
first microbes in the human gut and show how the biochemical environment is
altered by their appearance.
