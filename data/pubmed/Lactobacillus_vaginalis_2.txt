The natural antioxidant agent is urgently needed to prevent the negative effects 
of newly generated free radicals and chronic disorders. Recently, the microbial
exopolysaccharide (EPS) is currently used as a potential biopolymer due to its
unique biological characteristics. In this study, the biological potential was
carried out on the EPSs produced by Lactobacillus reuteri SHA101 (EPS-lr) and
Lactobacillus vaginalis SHA110 (EPS-lvg) isolated from gut cecum samples of
healthy poultry birds (hen). As results, the EPS-lr and EPS-lvg showed the
emulsifying activity of 37.8 ± 1.6% and 27.8 ± 0.5% after the 360 h,
respectively. The scanning electron microscopy analysis of EPS-lr and EPS-lvg
demonstrated a smooth surface with a compact structure. The both EPSs exhibited
strong antibacterial activity against E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium in
vitro. In additions, at 4 mg/mL concentration, the EPS-lr and EPS-lvg samples
showed potent antioxidant activity regarding hydroxyl radical DPPH
(2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radical, superoxide anion radical and reducing
power at OD700 nm. Furthermore, the EPS-lr and EPS-lvg (600 μg/mL) possessed
antitumor activity against colon cancer (Caco-2) cell after 72 h. The results
suggested that these EPSs would have great potential in the application of
antitumor and antioxidant foods, biomedicine, and pharmaceutics.
