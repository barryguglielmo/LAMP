Nitrates are chemicals found naturally in some foods such as fruit and vegetables
or added to others, especially meats, as a preservative. Their use as additives
is regulated by European Commission to avoid any risk for human health. In order 
to reduce or replace the use of these compounds, we investigated the
bacteriostatic/bactericidal activity of the essential oil of Thymus vulgaris L.
against Listeria innocua, a nonpathogenic microorganism with the same
morpho-cultural traits of L. monocytogenes. The study was carried out in vitro
and in vivo on processed meat products, i.e. mature salami, by using thyme
essential oil. Although the results are preliminary, the antilisterial activity
of the thyme essential oil was shown to be similar to that of nitrates.
