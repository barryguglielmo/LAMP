BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the prevalence of spreading pathways in
nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) pulmonary infections according to nodular
distribution patterns seen on chest computed tomography (CT).
METHODS: This study included 63 patients diagnosed with NTM lung infections who
underwent CT at our institution. A retrospective analysis of CT images focused on
the presence and distribution of nodules, presence of intrathoracic
lymphadenopathy and the predominant side of infection in the lungs. The findings 
were classified into five groups; centrilobular (bronchogenic spread),
perilymphatic (lymphangitic spread), random (hematogenous spread), combined
pattern and no nodules present. The groups were then compared according to other 
CT findings.
RESULTS: Among 51 (81%) patients identified with a nodular pattern on chest CT,
25 (39.8%) presented with centrilobular, 7 (11.1%) with perilymphatic, 6 (9.5%)
with random and 13 (20.6%) with combined nodular patterns but located in
different areas of the lungs. The right side of the lungs was predominant in
38 cases (60.3%). Intrathoracic lymphadenopathy was evident in 20 patients
(31.7%). Significant differences in distributions of nodular patterns were seen
in patients infected with Mycoplasma avium complex (MAC) associated with
centrilobular pattern (p = 0.0019) and M. fortuitum associated with random
pattern (p = 0.0004). Some of the findings were related to perilymphatic nodules 
between other isolated species of NTM (p = 0.0379).
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed a high proportion of perilymphatic
nodules and right-sided predominance in the upper lobe, which, combined with
intrathoracic lymphadenopathy is highly suggestive of the lymphangitic spread of 
lung NTM infections.
