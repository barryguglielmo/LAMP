Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of pneumonia, wherein infection of
respiratory mucosa drives a robust influx of neutrophils. We have previously
shown that S. pneumoniae infection of the respiratory epithelium induces the
production of the 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX)-dependent lipid inflammatory mediator 
hepoxilin A3, which promotes recruitment of neutrophils into the airways, tissue 
damage, and lethal septicemia. Pneumolysin (PLY), a member of the
cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC) family, is a major S. pneumoniae virulence 
factor that generates ∼25-nm diameter pores in eukaryotic membranes and promotes 
acute inflammation, tissue damage, and bacteremia. We show that a PLY-deficient
S. pneumoniae mutant was impaired in triggering human neutrophil transepithelial 
migration in vitro. Ectopic production of PLY endowed the nonpathogenic Bacillus 
subtilis with the ability to trigger neutrophil recruitment across human-cultured
monolayers. Purified PLY, several other CDC family members, and the α-toxin of
Clostridium septicum, which generates pores with cross-sectional areas nearly 300
times smaller than CDCs, reproduced this robust neutrophil transmigration. PLY
non-pore-forming point mutants that are trapped at various stages of pore
assembly did not recruit neutrophils. PLY triggered neutrophil recruitment in a
12-LOX-dependent manner in vitro. Instillation of wild-type PLY but not inactive 
derivatives into the lungs of mice induced robust 12-LOX-dependent neutrophil
migration into the airways, although residual inflammation induced by PLY in
12-LOX-deficient mice indicates that 12-LOX-independent pathways also contribute 
to PLY-triggered pulmonary inflammation. These data indicate that PLY is an
important factor in promoting hepoxilin A3-dependent neutrophil recruitment
across pulmonary epithelium in a pore-dependent fashion.
