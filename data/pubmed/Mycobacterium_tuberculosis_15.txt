Apoptotic and inflammatory pathways play important roles in Mycobacterium
tuberculosis-infected macrophages. Sirt1 is a member of the deacetylase family
that is known to promote apoptosis resistance in mammalian cells and was recently
reported to regulate mycobacterial immunopathogenesis via inflammatory responses.
However, the apoptotic role of Sirt1 in the process of M. tuberculosis infection 
remains unclear. With the help of mouse peritoneal macrophage samples, we have
shown that resveratrol, a Sirt1 activator, inhibited M. tuberculosis-induced
apoptosis in peritoneal macrophages. Further, we found that Sirt1 activation
prompted M. tuberculosis induced GSK3β phosphorylation. Further investigation
into the possible mechanisms of action showed that Sirt1 directly interacted with
GSK3β and enhanced GSK3β phosphorylation by promoting its deacetylation. Sirt1
activation inhibited M. tuberculosis growth. Thus, it seemed that Sirt1 acted as 
a novel regulator of apoptosis signaling in M. tuberculosis infection via its
direct effects on GSK3β. Sirt1 may therefore be a new candidate for the
prevention and treatment of tuberculosis.
