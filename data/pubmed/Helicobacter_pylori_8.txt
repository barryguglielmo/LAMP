BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) immunoglobulin G (IgG) seropositivity 
is prevalent but its relation with leukocyte telomere length (LTL), a cellular
aging biomarker, is unclear.
METHODS: Among 3,472 participants from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) cycle 1999-2000, LTL was measured with the
quantitative polymerase chain reaction. H pylori IgG was measured by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and defined as seropositivity with an immune
status ratio score > 0.9. We used linear regression models to examine the
relation of H pylori IgG seropositivity with continuous LTL and logistic
regression for the relation with short LTL (<10th percentile of the population
distribution) adjusting for potential confounders. We stratified the analyses by 
a priori selected variables.
RESULTS: Population prevalence of H pylori IgG seropositivity was 31.5% in the
overall population with higher prevalence found in those with older age, other
races than non-Hispanic whites, lower education, and being born out of the United
States. Continuous LTL was non-significantly shorter in those with H Pylori IgG
seropositivity versus seronegativity (mean difference = -40.3 bp, 95% CI: -112.4,
31.9). This difference was not significant after adjusting for potential
confounders nor stratifying by potential effect modifiers. H Pylori IgG
seropositivity was significantly associated with short LTL among the elderly
(55-75 years, adjusted OR: 3.06, 95% CI: 1.17, 7.99), but not in the overall
population (OR: 1.28, 95% CI: 0.81-2.02).
CONCLUSION: H Pylori IgG seropositivity was not associated with continuous LTL in
the general population but may be associated with an excessively short LTL in the
elderly.
