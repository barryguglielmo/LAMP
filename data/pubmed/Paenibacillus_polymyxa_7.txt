Paenibacillus polymyxa is a well-known Gram-positive biocontrol bacterium. It has
been reported that many P. polymyxa strains can inhibit bacteria, fungi and other
plant pathogens. Paenibacillus polymyxa employs a variety of mechanisms to
promote plant growth, so it is necessary to understand the biocontrol ability of 
bacteria at the genome level. In the present study, thanks to the widespread
availability of Paenibacillus genome data and the development of bioinformatics
tools, we were able to analyze and mine the genomes of 43 P. polymyxa strains.
The strain NCTC4744 was determined not to be P. polymyxa according to digital
DNA-DNA hybridization and average nucleotide identity. By analysis of the
pan-genome and the core genome, we found that the pan-genome of P. polymyxa was
open and that there were 3,192 core genes. In a gene cluster analysis of
secondary metabolites, 797 secondary metabolite gene clusters were found, of
which 343 are not similar to known clusters and are expected to reveal a large
number of new secondary metabolites. We also analyzed the plant growth-promoting 
genes that were mined and found, surpisingly, that these genes are highly
conserved. The results of the present study not only reveal a large number of
unknown potential secondary metabolite gene clusters in P. polymyxa, but also
suggest that plant growth promotion characteristics are evolutionary adaptations 
of P. polymyxa to plant-related habitats.
