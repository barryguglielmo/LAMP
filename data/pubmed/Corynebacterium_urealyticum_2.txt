Corynebacterium urealyticum is a non-diphtherial urease-producing clinically
relevant corynebacterial, most frequently involved in urinary tract infections.
Most of the C. urealyticum clinical isolates are frequently resistant to several 
antibiotics. We investigated the susceptibility of 40 C. urealyticum isolated in 
our institution during the period 2005-2017 to eight compounds representative of 
the main clinically relevant classes of antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial
susceptibility was determined by the Epsilometer test. Resistance genes were
searched by PCR. All strains were susceptible to vancomycin whereas linezolid and
rifampicin also showed good activity (MICs90 = 1 and 0.4 mg/L, respectively).
Almost all isolates (39/40, 97.5%) were multidrug resistant. The highest
resistance rate was observed for ampicillin (100%), followed by erythromycin
(95%) and levofloxacin (95%). Ampicillin resistance was associated with the
presence of the blaA gene, encoding a class A β-lactamase. The two
rifampicin-resistant strains showed point mutations driving amino acid
replacements in conserved residues of RNA polymerase subunit β (RpoB).
Tetracycline resistance was due to an efflux-mediated mechanism. Thirty-nine PFGE
patterns were identified among the 40 C. urealyticum, indicating that they were
not clonally related, but producing sporadic infections. These findings raise the
need of maintaining surveillance strategies among this multidrug resistant
pathogen.
