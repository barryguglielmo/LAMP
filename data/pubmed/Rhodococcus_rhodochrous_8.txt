BACKGROUND: Rhodococci are industrially important soil-dwelling Gram-positive
bacteria that are well known for both nitrile hydrolysis and oxidative metabolism
of aromatics. Rhodococcus rhodochrous ATCC BAA-870 is capable of metabolising a
wide range of aliphatic and aromatic nitriles and amides. The genome of the
organism was sequenced and analysed in order to better understand this whole cell
biocatalyst.
RESULTS: The genome of R. rhodochrous ATCC BAA-870 is the first Rhodococcus
genome fully sequenced using Nanopore sequencing. The circular genome contains
5.9 megabase pairs (Mbp) and includes a 0.53 Mbp linear plasmid, that together
encode 7548 predicted protein sequences according to BASys annotation, and 5535
predicted protein sequences according to RAST annotation. The genome contains
numerous oxidoreductases, 15 identified antibiotic and secondary metabolite gene 
clusters, several terpene and nonribosomal peptide synthetase clusters, as well
as 6 putative clusters of unknown type. The 0.53 Mbp plasmid encodes 677
predicted genes and contains the nitrile converting gene cluster, including a
nitrilase, a low molecular weight nitrile hydratase, and an enantioselective
amidase. Although there are fewer biotechnologically relevant enzymes compared to
those found in rhodococci with larger genomes, such as the well-known Rhodococcus
jostii RHA1, the abundance of transporters in combination with the myriad of
enzymes found in strain BAA-870 might make it more suitable for use in
industrially relevant processes than other rhodococci.
CONCLUSIONS: The sequence and comprehensive description of the R. rhodochrous
ATCC BAA-870 genome will facilitate the additional exploitation of rhodococci for
biotechnological applications, as well as enable further characterisation of this
model organism. The genome encodes a wide range of enzymes, many with unknown
substrate specificities supporting potential applications in biotechnology,
including nitrilases, nitrile hydratase, monooxygenases, cytochrome P450s,
reductases, proteases, lipases, and transaminases.
