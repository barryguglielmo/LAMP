Glycerol is a by-product of biodiesel, and it has a great application prospect to
be transformed to synthesize high value-added compounds. Pseudomonas chlororaphis
GP72 isolated from the green pepper rhizosphere is a plant growth promoting
rhizobacteria that can utilize amount of glycerol to synthesize
phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA). PCA has been commercially registered as
"Shenqinmycin" in China due to its characteristics of preventing pepper blight
and rice sheath blight. The aim of this study was to engineer glycerol
utilization pathway in P. chlororaphis GP72. First, the two genes glpF and glpK
from the glycerol metabolism pathway were overexpressed in GP72ANO separately.
Then, the two genes were co-expressed in GP72ANO, improving PCA production from
729.4 mg/L to 993.4 mg/L at 36 h. Moreover, the shunt pathway was blocked to
enhance glycerol utilization, resulting in 1493.3 mg/L PCA production.
Additionally, we confirmed the inhibition of glpR on glycerol metabolism pathway 
in P. chlororaphis GP72. This study provides a good example for improving the
utilization of glycerol to synthesize high value-added compounds in Pseudomonas.
