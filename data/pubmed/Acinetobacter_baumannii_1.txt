PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Carbapenem-resistant organisms (CROs), including Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacterales, are a threat worldwide.
This review will cover mechanisms of resistance within CROs and challenges with
identification and treatment of these organisms while pointing out unresolved
issues and ongoing challenges.
RECENT FINDINGS: The treatment of CROs has expanded through newer therapeutic
options. Guided utilization through genotypic and phenotypic testing is necessary
in order for these drugs to target the appropriate mechanisms of resistance and
select optimal antibiotic therapy.
SUMMARY: Identification methods and treatment options need to be precisely
understood in order to limit the spread and maximize outcomes of CRO infections.
