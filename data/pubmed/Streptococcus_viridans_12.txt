OBJECTIVES: The existing literature on the microbiota of the ileum is
inconsistent. To further characterize the microbiota, we analysed samples
obtained directly from resected ileums used for urinary diversion after radical
cystectomy.
METHODS: We included 150 patients with bladder cancer operated on from March 2016
to March 2019. Samples obtained by rubbing a swab against the ileal mucosa 25 cm 
from the ileocecal valve were cultivated at the local laboratory. Microbial
colonies were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of
flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF).
RESULTS: The microbial density of the distal ileum was low. Among our samples,
79% (95% confidence interval (CI) 71%, 84%) harboured less than 1.6 × 104 cfu/mL,
whereas 36% (95% CI 28%, 44%) harboured less than 1.6 cfu/mL. The flora was
dominated by viridans streptococci, Candida, Actinomyces, Rothia and
Lactobacillus species. Colon-related bacteria i.e. strict anaerobic bacteria,
Enterobacteriales and enterococci, were recovered from 14% of the samples.
Constipation was associated with increased recovery of colon-related bacteria.
Antibiotic treatment prior to surgical procedures did not affect culture results.
Increased age was significantly associated with more substantial fungal growth
and use of proton pump inhibitors seemed to increase both bacterial and fungal
growth.
CONCLUSIONS: The microbiota of the human distal ileum is sparse and differs
significantly from the colonic microbiota both quantitatively and by composition.
These findings contradict recent metagenomics studies based on samples collected 
by retrograde colonoscopy and emphasize the crucial importance of adequate
sampling techniques.
