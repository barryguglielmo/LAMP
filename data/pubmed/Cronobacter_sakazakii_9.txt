Phages are generally considered species- or even strain-specific, yet polyvalent 
phages are able to infect bacteria from different genera. Here, we characterize
the novel polyvalent phage S144, a member of the Loughboroughvirus genus. By
screening 211 Enterobacteriaceae strains, we found that phage S144 forms plaques 
on specific serovars of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica and on Cronobacter
sakazakii. Analysis of phage resistant mutants suggests that the O-antigen of
lipopolysaccharide is the phage receptor in both bacterial genera. The S144
genome consists of 53,628 bp and encodes 80 open reading frames (ORFs), but no
tRNA genes. In total, 32 ORFs coding for structural proteins were confirmed by
ESI-MS/MS analysis, whereas 45 gene products were functionally annotated within
DNA metabolism, packaging, nucleotide biosynthesis and phage morphogenesis.
Transmission electron microscopy showed that phage S144 is a myovirus, with a
prolate head and short tail fibers. The putative S144 tail fiber structure is,
overall, similar to the tail fiber of phage Mu and the C-terminus shows amino
acid similarity to tail fibers of otherwise unrelated phages infecting
Cronobacter. Since all phages in the Loughboroughvirus genus encode tail fibers
similar to S144, we suggest that phages in this genus infect Cronobacter
sakazakii and are polyvalent.
