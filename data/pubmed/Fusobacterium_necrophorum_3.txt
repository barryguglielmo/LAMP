Systemic infections due to Fusobacterium may originate in the tonsillar/internal 
jugular veins or from the abdomen. We encountered a patient who presented with
bacteremia, fulminant septic shock, and extensive soft tissue pyogenic infection 
due to Fusobacterium necrophorum. In addition, there was widespread metastatic
colon cancer with the unique finding of pre-mortem co-localization of F.
necrophorum and cancer cells at a site distant from the colon. We reviewed the
literature of the association of F. necrophorum and colon cancer, and discuss the
evidence of how each of these 2 distinct entities may mutually augment the
development or progression of the other.
