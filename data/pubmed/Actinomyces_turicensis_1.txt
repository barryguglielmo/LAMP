A 50-year-old woman presented with right back pain, low fever, leukocytosis, a
high level of C-reactive protein and a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate.
Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a hypodense lesion in the
right suprarenal region, while PET/CT showed mildly increased metabolic activity.
A CT-guided percutaneous puncture was performed, and foul-smelling thick pus was 
removed, which indicated an anaerobic infection. A smear of the pus showed both
gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. Traditional culture only detected
Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Actinomyces turicensis. While
surprisingly, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of both the pus and
blood showed high reads of multiple pathogens, including anaerobes and the three 
culture-positive pathogens. Thus, adrenal gland abscess was confirmed, and a
combination therapy of catheter drainage and effective antimicrobial treatment
was started. Six days later, the patient had clinically improved and mNGS showed 
dramatically decreased reads of all pathogens. A follow-up lab examination of
inflammatory biomarkers was normal, and the adrenal mass was reduced
radiographically.
