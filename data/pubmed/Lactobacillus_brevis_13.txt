Fermentative lactic acid production is currently impeded by low pH tolerance of
the production organisms, the successive substrate consumption of the strains
and/or the requirement to apply purified substrate streams. We identified
Lactobacillus brevis IGB 1.29 in compost, which is capable of producing lactic
acid at low pH values from lignocellulose hydrolysates, simultaneously consuming 
glucose and xylose. In this study, we compared Lactobacillus brevis IGB 1.29 with
the reference strains Lactobacillus brevis ATCC 367, Lactobacillus plantarum
NCIMB 8826 and Lactococcus lactis JCM 7638 with regard to the consumption of C5- 
and C6-sugars. Simultaneous conversion of C5- and C6-monosaccharides was
confirmed for L. brevis IGB 1.29 with consumption rates of 1.6 g/(L h) for
glucose and 1.0 g/(L h) for xylose. Consumption rates were lower for L. brevis
ATCC 367 with 0.6 g/(L h) for glucose and 0.2 g/(L h) for xylose. Further trials 
were carried out to determine the sensitivity towards common toxic degradation
products in lignocellulose hydrolysates: acetate, hydroxymethylfurfural,
furfural, formate, levulinic acid and phenolic compounds from hemicellulose
fraction. L. lactis was the least tolerant strain towards the inhibitors, whereas
L. brevis IGB 1.29 showed the highest tolerance. L. brevis IGB 1.29 exhibited
only 10% growth reduction at concentrations of 26.0 g/L acetate, 1.2 g/L
furfural, 5.0 g/L formate, 6.6 g/L hydroxymethylfurfural, 9.2 g/L levulinic acid 
or 2.2 g/L phenolic compounds. This study describes a new strain L. brevis IGB
1.29, that enables efficient lactic acid production with a lignocellulose-derived
C5- and C6-sugar fraction.
