Akkermansia muciniphila is a mucin-degrading bacterium commonly found in the
human gut that promotes a beneficial effect on health, likely based on the
regulation of mucus thickness and gut barrier integrity, but also on the
modulation of the immune system. In this work, we focus in OgpA from A.
muciniphila, an O-glycopeptidase that exclusively hydrolyzes the peptide bond
N-terminal to serine or threonine residues substituted with an O-glycan. We
determine the high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of the unliganded form of 
OgpA, the complex with the glycodrosocin O-glycopeptide substrate and its
product, providing a comprehensive set of snapshots of the enzyme along the
catalytic cycle. In combination with O-glycopeptide chemistry, enzyme kinetics,
and computational methods we unveil the molecular mechanism of O-glycan
recognition and specificity for OgpA. The data also contribute to understanding
how A. muciniphila processes mucins in the gut, as well as analysis of
post-translational O-glycosylation events in proteins.
