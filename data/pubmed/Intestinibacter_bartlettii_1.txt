Robust Microbial Markers for Non-Invasive Inflammatory Bowel Disease
Identification.

Wingfield B, Coleman S, McGinnity TM, Bjourson AJ.

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is an umbrella term for a group of inflammatory 
diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, including Crohn's Disease and ulcerative 
colitis. Changes to the intestinal microbiome, the community of micro-organisms
that resides in the human gut, have been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis 
of IBD. IBD diagnosis is often delayed due to its non-specific symptoms and
because an invasive colonoscopy is required for confirmation, which leads to poor
growth in children and worse treatment outcomes. Feature selection algorithms are
often applied to microbial communities to identify bacterial groups that drive
disease. It has been shown that aggregating Ensemble Feature Selection (EFS) can 
improve the robustness of feature selection algorithms, which is defined as the
variation of feature selector output caused by small changes to the dataset. In
this work, we apply a two-step filter and an EFS process to generate robust
feature subsets that can non-invasively predict IBD subtypes from high-resolution
microbiome data. The predictive power of the robust feature subsets is the
highest reported in literature to date. Furthermore, we identify five
biologically plausible bacterial species that have not previously been implicated
in IBD aetiology.
