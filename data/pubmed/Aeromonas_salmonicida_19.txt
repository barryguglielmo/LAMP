Aeromonas salmonicida is one of the most important pathogens in salmonids and
non-salmonids species. Nevertheless, very little was reported in cyprinids about 
A. salmonicida infection. Hence, a pathogenic A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, 
namely isolate GCA-518, was isolated from diseased crucian carp Carassius
auratus. Its optimal growth conditions were at 28 °C, pH 7.0 and 1.5% NaCl.
Furthermore, the quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) targeting serine protease
(aspA) gene was established for rapid detection of the lowest limit of 5.6 × 102 
copies per reaction. The pathogenicity was confirmed in crucian carp by
intraperitoneal infection. Histopathologic examination displayed multifocal
necrosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells in gill, liver, kidney and
intestine. This is the first report on typical A. salmonicida infection in
cultured crucian carp.
