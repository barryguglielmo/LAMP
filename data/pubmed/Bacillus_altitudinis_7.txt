Microbial gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) is a key enzyme in production of
several γ-glutamyl compounds with food and pharmaceutical applications. Bacterial
GGTs are not commercially available in the market owing to their low production
from various sources. Thus, the study was focused on achieving the higher GGT
production from B. altitudinis IHB B1644 by optimizing the culture conditions
using one-variable-at-a-time (OVAT) strategy. A mesophillic temperature of 28 °C,
agitation 200 rpm and neutral pH 7 were found to be optimal for higher GGT titre.
Among the medium components, the monosaccharide glucose served as the best carbon
source over disaccharides, and yeast extract was the preferred organic nitrogen
source over inorganic nitrogen sources. The statistical approaches
(Plakett-Burman and response surface methodology) were further employed for the
optimization of medium components. Medium composition: 0.1% w/v glucose, 0.3% w/v
yeast extract, 0.03% w/v magnesium sulphate, 0.20% w/v potassium dihydrogen
phosphate and 2.5% w/v sodium chloride with inoculum size (1% v/v) was suitable
for higher GGT titres (449 U ml-1). Time kinetics showed the stability of enzyme 
up to 96 h of incubation suggesting its application in the industrial use. The
proposed strategy resulted in 2.6-fold increase in the GGT production compared to
that obtained in the unoptimized medium. The results demonstrated that RSM was
fitting to identify the optimum production conditions and this finding should be 
of great importance for commercial GGT production.
