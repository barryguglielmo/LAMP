Lactobacillus acidophilus is one of the most commonly used industrial products
worldwide. Since its probiotic efficacy is strain-specific, the identification of
probiotics at both the species and strain levels is necessary. However, neither
phenotypic nor conventional genotypic methods have enabled the effective
differentiation of L. acidophilus strains. In this study, a whole-genome
sequence-based analysis was carried out to establish high-resolution strain
typing of 41 L. acidophilus strains (including commercial isolates and reference 
strains) using the cano-wgMLST_BacCompare analytics platform; consequently, a
strain-specific discrimination method for the probiotic strain LA1063 was
developed. Using a core-genome multilocus sequence-typing (cgMLST) scheme based
on 1390 highly conserved genes, 41 strains could be assigned to 34 sequence
types. Subsequently, we screened a set of 92 loci with a discriminatory power
equal to that of the 1390 loci cgMLST scheme. A strain-specific polymerase chain 
reaction combined with a multiplex minisequencing method was developed based on
four (phoU, secY, tilS, and uvrA_1) out of 21 loci, which could be discriminated 
between LA1063 and other L. acidophilus strains using the cgMLST data. We
confirmed that the strain-specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms method could
be used to quickly and accurately identify the L. acidophilus probiotic strain
LA1063 in commercial products.
