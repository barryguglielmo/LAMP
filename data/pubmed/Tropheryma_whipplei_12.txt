We report a case of culture-negative aortic valve endocarditis secondary to
Tropheryma whipplei infection. Our patient underwent aortic valve replacement
after 4 weeks of antibiotic therapy with persistently negative blood culture
results. Despite a technically uneventful operation, the patient showed continued
sepsis and was unresponsive to a broad-spectrum of antibiotic therapy with
subsequent multiorgan failure. He died on the 5th postoperative day, and
diagnosis was established at postmortem examination. In this case report, we
discuss the diagnosis and treatment of a rare type of endocarditis caused by T.
whipplei.
