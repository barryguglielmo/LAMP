BACKGROUND: Glyphosate-based herbicides are one of the most commonly used
compounds to control perennial weeds around the world. This compound is very
persistent in the environment and tends to filter into aquatic ecosystems,
affecting non-target species such as mosquito larvae. Aedes aegypti mosquitoes
are vectors of multiple arboviruses such as dengue and Zika. Glyphosate can be
degraded into non-harmful environmental compounds by Lysinibacillus sphaericus, a
spore forming bacterium which can also kill Ae. aegypti larvae. In this study, we
assessed the effect of glyphosate concentrations, typically used in Colombia, on 
the entomopathogenic activity of L. sphaericus against Ae. aegypti larvae.
METHODS: Bioassays and toxicity curves were performed to compare the larval
mortality between different treatments with and without bacteria and glyphosate
(Roundup 747®). Larvae were exposed to both bacteria and glyphosate by adding the
compound on chloride-free water. Comparisons were made using both probit
regression and ANOVA analysis.
RESULTS: ANOVA showed a significant difference in larval mortality when adding
glyphosate and L. sphaericus at the same time. Thus, a positive synergic effect
on larval mortality was found when L. sphaericus and glyphosate were mixed.
According to probit analysis, median lethal dose (LD50) for bacterial mixture was
of 106.23 UFC/ml and for glyphosate was 2.34 g/l.
CONCLUSIONS: A positive synergic effect on the mortality of larval Ae. aegypti
when exposed to L. sphaericus mixture and glyphosate was found. Molecular studies
focusing on the toxin production of L. sphaericus are required to understand more
about this synergistic effect.
