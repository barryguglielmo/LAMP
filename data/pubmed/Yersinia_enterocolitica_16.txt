Yersinia entercolitica is a bacterial species within the genus Yersinia, mostly
known as a human enteric pathogen, but also recognized as a zoonotic agent
widespread in domestic pigs. Findings of this bacterium in wild animals are very 
limited. The current report presents results of the identification of cultures of
Y. entercolitica from dead bats after a massive bat die-off in a cave in western 
Georgia. The growth of bacterial colonies morphologically suspected as Yersinia
was observed from three intestine tissues of 11 bats belonging to the Miniopterus
schreibersii species. These three isolates were identified as Y. enterocolitica
based on the API29 assay. No growth of Brucella or Francisella bacteria was
observed from tissues of dead bats. Full genomes (a size between 4.6-4.7 Mbp) of 
the Yersinia strains isolated from bats were analyzed. The phylogenetic sequence 
analyses of the genomes demonstrated that all strains were nearly identical and
formed a distinct cluster with the closest similarity to the environmental
isolate O:36/1A. The bat isolates represent low-pathogenicity Biotype 1A strains 
lacking the genes for the Ail, Yst-a, Ysa, and virulence plasmid pYV, while
containing the genes for Inv, YstB, and MyfA. Further characterization of the
novel strains cultured from bats can provide a clue for the determination of the 
pathogenic properties of those strains.
