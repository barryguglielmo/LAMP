BACKGROUND: Endophthalmitis caused by Enterococci is rare, and cases involving
vancomycin-resistant enterococci are even rarer. We report the first case of
Enterococcus casseliflavus endophthalmitis associated with injury caused by a
pig. We also review reported cases of exogenous endophthalmitis caused by
Enterococcus casseliflavus and discuss the clinical management and prognosis of
this disease.
CASE SUMMARY: A 43-year-old man with no previous visual problems complained of
endophthalmitis in his left eye following injury caused by a pig. Visual acuity
was light perception and B-ultrasonography revealed vitreous opacities with
retinal detachment. He was treated with intravitreal vancomycin and ceftazidime
after refusing vitrectomy. However, the vitreous opacities and retinal detachment
deteriorated and he underwent vitrectomy 5 d post-injury. Intraoperatively,
advanced rhegmatogenous and tractional retinal detachment with proliferative
vitreoretinopathy were observed. On postoperative day 5, vitreous cultures grew
Gram-positive cocci identified as Enterococcus casseliflavus. A 2-wk course of
intravenous ampicillin and dexamethasone was commenced. On postoperative day 14, 
visual acuity improved to hand movement. At 6 mo post-injury, visual acuity
improved to 20/667, but optic atrophy was present.
CONCLUSION: Systemic administration of linezolid in the treatment of Enterococcus
casseliflavus endophthalmitis can improve visual acuity. However, intravitreal
amikacin should be considered despite concerns of toxicity when oral linezolid
fails to prompt improvement.
