Rice is an important food crop in the world, and rice blast is one of the major
fungal diseases that cause large-scale rice yield reduction. This study aimed to 
investigate the antagonistic activity and its molecular mechanism of bacterial
strain JK isolated from seeds of super hybrid rice 'Shenliangyou 5814' (Oryza
sativa L.) against rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae ACCC 36020. Through
plate confrontation experiment, strain JK showed obvious and highly effective
antagonistic activity against M. oryzae. And strain JK was identified as Bacillus
velezensis by molecular biological identification basing on 16S rRNA gene and
gyrA gene phylogenetic analysis. The draft genome of strain JK was sequenced by
Illumina NextSeq500, and 1 CDS for beta-1,4-glucanase (cellulase), 1 CDS for
endo-beta-1,3-1,4 glucanase (licheninase), 2 CDS for 3-hydroxybutyrate
dehydrogenase, 4 CDS for surfactin synthase, 28 CDS for polyketide biosynthesis
were annotated and correlated to antagonistic activity. The present study
provides a theoretical basis and microbial strain resources for further study on 
the biological control of rice blast.
