Aztreonam-avibactam was tested against 1,839 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia
collected worldwide and demonstrated potent activity against isolates from all
geographic regions and infection types (overall MIC50/90, 4/4 mg/L; 97.8%
inhibited at ≤8 mg/L). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX; MIC50/90, ≤0.5/1
mg/L; 95.4% susceptible) and minocycline (MIC50/90, 0.5/2 mg/L; 99.5%
susceptible) also were very active. Aztreonam-avibactam inhibited 84.7% of
TMP-SMX-nonsusceptible isolates at ≤8 mg/L. Aztreonam-avibactam may represent a
valuable option to treat S. maltophilia infections, addressing a major unmet
medical need.
