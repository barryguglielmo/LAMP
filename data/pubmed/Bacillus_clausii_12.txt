PURPOSE: This prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
parallel-group study aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of a multistrain 
(Bacillus coagulans [SNZ 1969], Bacillus clausii [SNZ 1971], and Bacillus
subtilis [SNZ 1972]) probiotic blend (SNZ TriBac) in managing symptoms of
gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort in the absence of specific pathologies.
METHODS: Sixty adults with symptoms of GI discomfort were enrolled (mean age,
34.89 Â± 9.95 years) and randomized to receive either SNZ TriBac or placebo.
Changes from baseline in Severity of Dyspepsia Assessment (SODA),
Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), and Quality of Life (QoL) scales
over the course of product use were determined at baseline and on days 30 and 37 
as study outcomes.
RESULTS: On day 30, significant improvement with SNZ TriBac was noted in SODA
burping/belching (P = 0.025), bloating (P = 0.048), sour taste (P = 0.025), and
total (P = 0.007) scores as well as pain (P = 0.003), non-pain (P = 0.04), and
satisfaction (P = 0.03) subscores. Significant improvement with SNZ TriBac was
also observed in SODA burping/belching (P = 0.011), sour taste (P = 0.011), and
total SODA scores (P < 0.001), and in SODA pain (P = 0.005), non-pain (P = 0.06),
and satisfaction (P = 0.004) subscores on day 37. No adverse events were
reported.
CONCLUSION: Significant improvement in final SODA scores and subscores with SNZ
TriBac versus placebo indicates improvement in several symptoms of
gastrointestinal discomfort. This multistrain probiotic blend was well tolerated 
and could be an effective option for treatment of GI discomfort.
