The arsC gene-encoded arsenate reductase is a vital catalytic enzyme for
remediation of environmental arsenic (As). Microorganisms containing the arsC
gene can convert pentavalent arsenate (As[V]) to trivalent arsenite (As[III]) to 
be either retained in the bacterial cell or released into the air. The molecular 
mechanism governing this process is unknown. Here we present an in silico model
of the enzyme to describe their probable active site cavities using SCFBio
servers. We retrieved the amino acid sequence of bacterial arsenate reductase
enzymes in FASTA format from the NCBI database. Enzyme structure was predicted
using the I-TASSER server and visualized using PyMOL tools. The ProSA and the
PROCHECK servers were used to evaluate the overall significance of the predicted 
model. Accordingly, arsenate reductase from Streptococcus pyogenes, Oligotropha
carboxidovorans OM5, Rhodopirellula baltica SH 1, and Serratia ureilytica had the
highest quality scores with statistical significance. The plausible cavities of
the active site were identified in our examined arsenate reductase enzymes which 
were abundant in glutamate and lysine residues with 6 to 16 amino acids. This in 
silico experiment may contribute greatly to the remediation of arsenic pollution 
through the utilization of microbial species.
