In this study, the optimization of distinctive environmental factors such as pH, 
temperature, agitation-speed and atrazine-concentration on atrazine degradation
by utilizing Bacillus badius ABP6 strain, has been done through
response-surface-methodology (RSM). The optimum-conditions after analysis for the
maximum atrazine degradation were: pH 7.05, temperature 30.4 °C, agitation-speed 
145.7 rpm, and atrazine-concentration 200.9 ppm. The prescribed model was
approved for high F-value (95.92), very low P-value (<0.01) and non- significant 
lack of fit (0.1627). It was observed that under the optimized-conditions, the R2
value of regression models for all the response variables was 0.9897 and the
maximum atrazine degradation i.e. 89.7 % was found. Finally for graphical
representation, the validated optimum-conditions of variables and responses were 
simulated using three dimensional plots (3D). The confirmation of the model is
successful to suggest the optimization parameters of atrazine degradation under
in-situ condition by bacterial isolate employing response-surface-methodology
optimization tool of Design expert software (new version 10.0.1).
