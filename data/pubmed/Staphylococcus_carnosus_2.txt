The quality of fermented sausage is strongly influenced by its fatty acid (FA).
However, the role of a defined starter culture in modifying sausage FA
composition, and especially in the production of hydroxy FAs (HFAs), has not been
determined. In this study, the FA compositions of sausages fermented with
Latilactobacillus sakei, with L. sakei plus Staphylococcus carnosus, and with an 
aseptic control were characterized by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
(MS)/MS and gas chromatography-MS. The sausages fermented with L. sakei, and with
L. sakei plus S. carnosus, showed a reduced accumulation of poly and/or
diunsaturated FAs and distinct composition of HFAs compared to the aseptic
control. 2-HFAs were enriched via high-speed counter-current chromatography and
identified uniquely in the L. sakei plus S. carnosus fermented sausage. Through
lipid analyses, this study illustrated how the choice of a defined starter
culture affected the observed FA metabolism in fermented sausages, facilitating
the development of starter cultures or additives that impart desirable
characteristics to sausage.
