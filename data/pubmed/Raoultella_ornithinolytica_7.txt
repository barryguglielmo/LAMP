The aim of the present study was to characterize Enterobacterales resistant to
3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins, carbapenems and/or fluoroquinolones,
isolated from dogs and cats with urogenital infections. In total, 36 strains
(Escherichia coli (n = 28), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 3), Serratia marcescens,
Raoultella ornithinolytica, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter portucalensis and
Enterobacter cloacae (each n = 1)) were included in the present study, 28 from
Austria and 8 from Serbia. Isolates were characterized by a polyphasic approach
including susceptibility pheno- and genotyping and microarray-based assays.
Escherichia (E.) coli isolates were additionally characterized by two-locus (fumC
and fimH) sequence phylotyping and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) of selected
isolates. MLST of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacter cloacae isolates was also
performed. Among E. coli, the most dominant phylogenetic group was B1 (27.8%),
followed by C, (16.6%), A and Clade II (5.5% each), B2 and F (2.77% each). The
most predominant β-lactam resistance genes were blaTEM (70%) and blaCTX-M
(38.8%), blaCMY (25%). blaNDM was detected in one carbapenem-resistant
Enterobacter cloacae ST114. The most common ST among selected E. coli was 744
(10.7% isolates). The pandemic clones ST131 and ST648 carrying CTX-M-15 were also
detected. Remaining STs belonged to 469, 1287, 1463 and 1642. E. coli clonotyping
revealed 20 CH types. Based on the presence of certain virulence genes, three
isolates were categorized as ExPEC/UPEC. The most prevalent virulence factors
were fimH detected in 61%, iucD and iss both in 55%, iroN in 27.8%, papC in 13.8%
and sat in 8.3% isolates.
