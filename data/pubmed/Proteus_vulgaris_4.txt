Hairy root induction in Plantago lanceolata was optimized to take advantage of
transformed root cultures. The highest frequency of transformation was achieved
using leaf explant, A4 strain, pre-cultivation of explant, 150 µM Acetosyringone,
5 min inoculation, half-strength Murashige and Skoog basal medium as
co-cultivation, and half-strength Gamborg's basal medium as a selective medium
with 3% sucrose. Among the studied compound encompassing gallic acid, catalpol
and apigenin, only the production of gallic acid in hairy roots was affected by
20 mg L-1 AgNO3 and 100 mg L-1 chitosan at 24 hr which yielded 7.63, 4.76-fold
increase in its content, respectively. The methanolic extracts of hairy roots
elicited by 20 mg L-1 AgNO3 exhibited anti-bacterial activity (MIC and MBC =
25 mg mL-1) against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris and Salmonella typhi 
and anti-bacterial potential of non-elicited hairy roots of P. lanceolata (MIC = 
25 mg mL-1 and MBC = 35 mg mL-1) were more active against Klebsiella pneumoniae
and P. vulgaris than other bacteria. The methanolic extracts of the P. lanceolata
hairy roots demonstrated significant cytotoxic activity on colorectal carcinoma
cell line (SW-480) with IC50 = 250.65 ± 6.8 µg mL-1 in comparison to human
embryonic kidney (HEK-293) with IC50 = 5263.65 ± 4.6 µg mL-1. Plantago lanceolata
hairy roots showed important biological activity explaining its role in
traditional medicine.
