A 76-year-old man presented with neck swelling associated with pain and fever. On
examination, there was a submental neck swelling. His initial CT scan showed
multiloculated abscess centred in the left submandibular gland. He remained
febrile despite on intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole. A repeat CT scan
revealed significant worsening with multiple pockets of fluids with gas locules
in the deep neck spaces. He subsequently underwent neck exploration and drainage 
of neck abscess. Extensive necrotic tissue was found intraoperatively and thick
pus was drained from the bilateral parapharyngeal, submental spaces and anterior 
mediastium. Pus culture profusely grew of Eggerthella species. Patient recovered 
well following further intravenous antibiotic therapy. Diabetes mellitus and
odontogenic infections are the common risk factors in deep neck infections. Our
patient is however non-diabetic and edentulous. Current case is presented to
serve as a rare case of neck abscess with unusual cause in a non-diabetic
patient.
