Lactic acid is an intermediate-volume specialty chemical, used in the production 
of biodegradable polymers and other chemicals. Although lactic acid production
process is well established, however, the cost of production is very high.
Therefore, in this study; starchy biomass (cassava) was hydrolyzed with in-house 
enzyme cocktail prepared from Aspergillus foetidus MTCC508 and Bacillus subtilis 
RA10. Process optimization using Taguchi experimental design helped to optimize
the most effective ratio of fungal and bacterial amylase for effective
saccharification of cassava. A higher sugar yield of 379.63 mg/gds was obtained
under optimized conditions, using 30 U/gds of bacterial enzyme and 90 U/gds of
the fungal enzyme at pH 4 within 48 h of saccharification. Among 11 lactic acid
bacteria isolated, Lactobacillus fermentum S1A and Lactobacillus farraginis SS3A 
produced the highest amount of lactic acid 0.81 g/g and 0.77 g/g, respectively,
from the cassava hydrolysate. The study proved the potential renewable source of 
cassava biomass as a source for fermentable sugars that can be fermented to
lactic acid with high yield. In future, this cost-effective and
environmental-friendly bioprocess can be upscaled for industrial lactic acid
production.
