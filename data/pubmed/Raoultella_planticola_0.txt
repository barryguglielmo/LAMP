BACKGROUND: Raoultella planticola(R.planticola) is a very rare opportunistic
pathogen and sometimes even associated with fatal infection in pediatric cases.
Recently,the emergence of carbapenem resistance strains are constantly being
reported and a growing source of concern for pediatricians.
CASE PRESENTATION: We reported 4 cases of neonatal septicemia caused by
Raoultella planticola. Their gestational age was 211 to 269 days, and their birth
weight was 1490 to 3000 g.The R. planticola infections were detected on the 9th
to 27th day after hospitalization and occured between May and June. They
clinically manifested as poor mental response, recurrent cyanosis, apnea,
decreased heart rate and blood oxygen, recurrent jaundice, fever or nonelevation 
of body temperature. The C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were elevated at
significantly in the initial phase of the infection,and they had leukocytosis or 
leukopenia. Prior to R.planticola infection,all of them recevied at least one
broad-spectrum antibiotic for 7-27d.All the R.planticola strains detected were
only sensitive to amikacin, but resistant to other groups of drugs:
cephalosporins (such as cefazolin, ceftetan,etc) and penicillins (such as
ampicillin-sulbactam,piperacillin,etc),and even developed resistance to
carbapenem. All the infants were clinically cured and discharged with overall
good prognosis.
CONCLUSION: Neonatal septicemia caused by Raoultella planticola mostly occured in
hot and humid summer, which lack specific clinical manifestations. Pediatricians 
should keep in mind that R. planticola can be a potential source of neonatal
sepsis and even has the potential to acquire carbapenem-resistance. Preventing
outbreaks of epidemics requires early detection, timely diagnosis and treatment, 
and active isolation.
