Objective: To investigate the molecular characteristics of carbapenem-resistant
Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) from county hospitals in China.
Materials and Methods: Forty-three sequential non-duplicate CRE strains
(including 33 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 4 Enterobacter cloacae isolates, 3 
Escherichia coli isolates, 1 Serratia marcescens, 1 Morganella morganii and 1
Citrobacter freundii) were collected from 4 county hospitals and 2 municipal
hospitals. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted by broth
microdilution method, using 3-aminophenylboronic acid and EDTA and the modified
carbapenem inactivation method (mCIM) to screen phenotype of carbapenemase.
β-Lactamases were characterized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA
sequencing. The transferability of bla NDM-5 was investigated by transformation
experiment. Clonal relatedness was evaluated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis 
and multilocus sequence typing .
Results: The results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing indicated that 43
CRE strains were resistant to most of the antimicrobial agents, except
tigecycline and colistin. Overall, 93%, 93%, and 97.7% of these strains were
resistant to imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem, respectively. PCR and DNA
sequencing indicated that 67.4% (29/43) were bla KPC-2 positive isolates, in
which 3.4% (1/29) was coproduced with bla NDM-1. In addition, 7.0% (3/43), 4.7%
(2/43), 4.7% (2/43), 2.3% (1/43), 2.3% (1/43) were bla NDM-1, bla NDM-16, bla
NDM-4, bla NDM-5, bla IMP-4 positive isolates, respectively. The 29 bla
KPC-2-positive isolates belonged to 12 different PFGE type and designated as ST11
(n=20) and ST15, ST39, ST116, ST667, ST2245, ST2338. The plasmid bearing bla
NDM-5 could be transferred into recipient E. coli J53 through transformation.
Conclusion: Our study indicated the dissemination of CRE between the tertiary
hospitals and secondary hospitals.
