We delineate the excellent bactericidal efficacy of stable heterojunction
nanocomposites composed of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and copper(II)
oxide (CuO) synthesized via facile recrystallization and calcination. The
bactericidal effectiveness of the fabricated nanocomposites was examined using
the standard broth-dilution method and the growth-inhibition-zone analysis
method, in which bacteria cultured in an incubator in tryptic soy broth medium
were subjected to the prepared samples. The bactericidal activity of all of the
as-synthesized samples is evident in both methods, displaying a substantial
decrease in bacterial colonies and resulting in clear inhibition zones,
respectively. Among the CuO-SWCNT nanocomposites, the sample subjected to
calcination at 500°C for 5 h was found to exhibit the best performance against
Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, forming inhibition zones 182% and
162% larger than those formed by pure CuO, respectively.
