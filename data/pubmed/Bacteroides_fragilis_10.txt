Mechanistic studies of anaerobic gut bacteria have been hindered by the lack of a
fluorescent protein system to track and visualize proteins and dynamic cellular
processes in actively growing bacteria. Although underappreciated, many gut
"anaerobes" are able to respire using oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor.
The oxygen continually released from gut epithelial cells creates an oxygen
gradient from the mucus layer to the anaerobic lumen [L. Albenberg et al.,
Gastroenterology 147, 1055-1063.e8 (2014)], with oxygen available to bacteria
growing at the mucus layer. Here, we show that Bacteroides species are
metabolically and energetically robust and do not mount stress responses in the
presence of 0.10 to 0.14% oxygen, defined as nanaerobic conditions [A. D. Baughn,
M. H. Malamy, Nature 427, 441-444 (2004)]. Taking advantage of this metabolic
capability, we show that nanaerobic growth provides sufficient oxygen for the
maturation of oxygen-requiring fluorescent proteins in Bacteroides species. Type 
strains of four different Bacteroides species show bright GFP fluorescence when
grown nanaerobically versus anaerobically. We compared four different red
fluorescent proteins and found that mKate2 yields the highest red fluorescence
intensity in our assay. We show that GFP-tagged proteins can be localized in
nanaerobically growing bacteria. In addition, we used time-lapse fluorescence
microscopy to image dynamic type VI secretion system processes in metabolically
active Bacteroides fragilis The ability to visualize fluorescently labeled
Bacteroides and fluorescently linked proteins in actively growing nanaerobic gut 
symbionts ushers in an age of imaging analyses not previously possible in these
bacteria.
