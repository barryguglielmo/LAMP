OBJECTIVES: A standard treatment regimen against Mycobacteroides abscessus
complex (MABC) infections has not yet been established, making MABC difficult to 
treat successfully. In this study, we sought to develop an active ingredient for 
the clinical treatment of MABC infections.
METHODS: We screened 102 MABC strains isolated from clinical specimens using DNA 
sequence analysis with the housekeeping genes hsp65 and rpoB. Drug susceptibility
testing was performed against two subspecies-Mycobacteroides abscessus subsp.
abscessus (M. abscessus) and Mycobacteroides abscessus subsp. massiliense (M.
massiliense)-using eight antimicrobial agents (clarithromycin, amikacin,
doxycycline, imipenem, linezolid, moxifloxacin, faropenem, and rifampicin). The
combined efficacy of the antimicrobial agents was investigated using a
checkerboard method.
RESULTS: We identified 51 isolates as M. abscessus, 46 as M. massiliense, and
five as others. Most of the M. abscessus isolates (83.0 %) exhibited inducible
resistance to clarithromycin via the expression of the erm(41) gene. Combinations
of imipenem with linezolid, moxifloxacin, and rifampicin exhibited additive
effects against 81.0 %, 40.7 %, and 26.9 % of M. abscessus, respectively, and
against 54.5 %, 69.2 %, and 30.8 % of M. massiliense, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated the potential efficacy of a regimen
containing imipenem against M. abscessus and M. massiliense infections.
