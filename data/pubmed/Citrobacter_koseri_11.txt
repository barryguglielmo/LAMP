The biocatalyzed synthesis of purine nucleosides and their analogs is a case
widely studied due to the high pharmaceutical interest of these compounds,
providing the whole-cell biocatalysts, a useful tool for this purpose. Vidarabine
and fludarabine are commercial examples of expensive bioactive nucleosides that
can be prepared using a microbial transglycosylation approach. Citrobacter koseri
whole-cells immobilized on agarose beads proved to be an interesting option to
transform this biotransformation in a preparative process. The entrapment matrix 
provided a useful and resistant multipurpose biocatalyst regarding its stability,
mechanical strength, microbial viability and reuse. Immobilized biocatalyst
retained the initial activity for up to 1 year storage and after 10 years, the
biocatalyst did not show cell leaking and still exhibited residual activity. In
addition, the biocatalyst could be reused in batch 68 times keeping up to 50% of 
the initial biocatalytic activity and for at least 124 h in a continuous process.
