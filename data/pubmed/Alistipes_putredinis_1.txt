PURPOSE: Distinct anatomical rearrangements of the gastrointestinal tract
achieved by various types of bariatric surgery cause changes in nutrient intake
and gut microbiota. The contribution of such gut microbiota changes to remission 
of type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains unclear.
AIM: We examined gut microbiota changes following banded Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
(RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) in a randomised study, in relation to T2D
remission.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing was carried out on
paired stool samples at pre- and 1-year post-surgery collected from 44
participants with T2D randomised to banded Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or
sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Taxonomic composition and predicted functional potential
of the gut bacteria were identified using HUMANn2, and annotated using MetaCyc.
Five-day dietary records (analysed using FoodWorks v8.0), body weight and
diabetes status were recorded at both time points.
RESULTS: RYGB participants had higher percentage excess weight loss than SG
(p = 0.01), even though dietary intake was similar at 1-year post-surgery.
Similar proportions achieved diabetes remission (HbA1c < 48 mmol/mol without
medications) after either RYGB (68%) or SG (59%). RYGB resulted in increased
abundances of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, while SG resulted in increased
Bacteroidetes. Pre-surgery, an increased abundance of Eubacteriaceae (p = 0.01)
and Alistipes putredinis (p = 0.01) was observed in those who went on to remit
from T2D post-surgery. Following surgery, Lachnospiraceae (p = 0.04) and
Roseburia (p = 0.01) species were more abundant in those who had achieved T2D
remission.
CONCLUSIONS: Specific stool bacterial taxa may signal likelihood of T2D remission
after bariatric surgery which is potentially mediated by increases in
Lachnospiraceae and Roseburia.
