AIMS: To evaluate four DNA extraction methods to elucidate the most effective
method for bacterial DNA recovery from human milk (HM).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Human milk DNA was extracted using the following methods:
(i) Qiagen MagAttract Microbial DNA Isolation Kit (kit QM), (ii) Norgen Milk
Bacterial DNA Isolation Kit (kit NM), (iii) Qiagen MagAttract Microbiome DNA/RNA 
Isolation Kit (kit MM) and (iv) TRIzol LS Reagent (method LS). The full-length
16S rRNA gene was sequenced. Kits MM and method LS were unable to extract
detectable levels of DNA in 9/11 samples. Detectable levels of DNA were recovered
from all samples using kits NM (mean = 0·68 ng μl-1 ) and QM (mean = 0·55 ng μl-1
). For kits NM and QM, the greatest number of reads were associated with
Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus vestibularis, Propionibacterium acnes, 
Veillonella dispar and Rothia mucilaginosa. Contamination profiles varied
substantially between kits, with one bacterial species detected in negative
extraction controls generated with kit QM and six with kit NM.
CONCLUSIONS: Kit QM is the most suitable of the kits tested for the extraction of
bacterial DNA from human milk.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Choice of extraction method impacts the
efficiency of bacterial DNA extraction from human milk and the resultant
bacterial community profiles generated from these samples.
