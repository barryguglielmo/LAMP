Two Pseudomonas isolates derived independently from raw refrigerated processing
meat of bovine origin intended for the manufacture of Bologna-type cooked sausage
could be distinguished from other known species in subsequent phylogenetic
analyses. Comparison of the complete rpoB gene sequences in combination with
nearly complete 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed a separate branch within the
Pseudomonas fragi group. In further analyses, comprising phenotypic and
chemotaxonomic characterization as well as average nucleotide identity (ANI)
values obtained from the draft genome assemblies, the two isolates could be
distinguished from all so far published closely related species. The closest
relative was P. fragi DSM 3456T with ANI values of about 90.2 %. Other close
Pseudomonas neighbours were P. psychrophila DSM 17535T (86.5 %), P.
deceptionensis DSM 26521T (86.4 %), P. versuta DSM 101070T (83.8 %), P.
taetrolens DSM 21104T (83.2 %), P. weihenstephanensis DSM 29166T (82.3 %), P.
helleri DSM 29165T (82.7 %) and P. lundensis DSM 6252T (81.9 %). The G+C contents
of isolates TH39T and TH26 were both 58.2 mol%. The major cellular lipids of
strain TH39T were phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and
diphosphatidylglycerol; the major quinone was Q9 with small amounts of Q8. Based 
on these data, the isolates TH39T and TH26 (=DSM 107389=LMG 30831) represent a
novel species within the genus Pseudomonas , for which the name Pseudomonas
bubulae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is TH39T (=DSM 107390T=LMG 30830T).
