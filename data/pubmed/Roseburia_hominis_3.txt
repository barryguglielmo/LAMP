BACKGROUND & AIMS: Fatigue is frequent and disabling in patients with
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) but its mechanisms are poorly understood. We
investigated alterations in fecal microbiomes and serum metabolomes and proteomes
in patients with quiescent IBD, with vs without fatigue.
METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study of patients (44% women;
mean age, 39.8 y) with clinically and endoscopically quiescent Crohn's disease
(n = 106) or ulcerative colitis (n = 60) at a tertiary hospital, from March 2016 
through December 2018. Fatigue was assessed using the functional assessment of
chronic illness therapy-fatigue scoring system and defined as a score of 43 or
less. We performed metabolomic analysis of serum samples using liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry methods and proteomic analysis using multiplex
proximity extension assay (PEA) technology. Stool samples were obtained from 50
patients and analyzed by shotgun metagenomic sequencing on Illumina HiSeq
platform.
RESULTS: Of the 166 study participants, 91 (55%) were fatigued. Serum samples
from patients with fatigue (n = 59) did not have significant increases in levels 
of inflammatory cytokines compared with serum samples from nonfatigued patients
(n = 72). We found a statistically significant difference in a cluster of 18
serum metabolites between patients with fatigue (n = 84) vs without fatigue (n = 
72) (P = .033); serum samples from patients with fatigue had significant
reductions in levels of methionine (P = .020), tryptophan (P = .042), proline (P 
= .017), and sarcosine (P = .047). Fecal samples from patients with fatigue had a
less diverse gut microbiome, with significant reductions in butyrate-producing
bacteria, including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (P = .0002, q =.007)
and Roseburia hominis (P = .0079, q = 0.105). This fatigue-like microbiome was
associated with fatigue scales and correlated with progressive depletion of
metabolites from serum samples.
CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of fecal and serum samples from 166 patients with
IBD, we found alterations in serum metabolites and fecal microbes that were
associated with fatigue.
