Bloodstream Infection Caused by Bacteroides caccae in a Diabetic Patient: a Case 
Report and Review of the Literature.

BACKGROUND: Bacteroides caccae is a ubiquitous, anaerobic bacteria, but it is not
a common cause of pathologic bloodstream infection. Diabetic patients are at
increased risk of developing anaerobic bacteria infection. Here, we report a
repeated fever case caused by Bacteroides caccae in a diabetic patient. The aim
of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics and manifestations of 
Bacteroides caccae.
METHODS: The pathogenic bacteria isolated from patient blood was identified as
Bacteroides caccae. Identification of the Bacteroides caccae was done by 16s rDNA
sequencing and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of light
spectrometry. The infection was cured by one-week combined therapy of intravenous
Piperacillin tazobactam and oral Ornidazole tablet.
RESULTS: After treatment had been completed, no episodes of fever occurred during
the follow-up to date.
CONCLUSIONS: Bacteroides caccae is regarded as an intestinal, opportunistic
pathogenic bacteria. It can invade the mucosa of the intestine and cause various 
abdominal suppurative infections. Sequencing and matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization-time of flight spectrometry could have a role for
Bacteroides caccae diagnosis. The curative effect of using first generation
cephalosporines therapy was unsatisfactory. Using intravenous Piperacillin
tazobactam and ornidazole tablet might obtain certain curative effect. Early
diagnosis and appropriate anti-infection therapy were necessary to improve the
outcome of patients with Bacteroides caccae bloodstream infection.
