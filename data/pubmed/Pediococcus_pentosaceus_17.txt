This study investigated the impact of NaCl concentrations on the growth
performance, antioxidant activity, and cell surface physiological characteristics
of Pediococcus pentosaceus R1 and Lactobacillus fermentum R6. The growth of the
two strains was significantly inhibited by 4 and 6% NaCl and stagnated at 8% NaCl
(P < 0.05). Compared with the control, both strains showed higher acid-producing 
activity, antioxidant activity and autoaggregation ability at 2 or 4% NaCl. A
lower cell surface hydrophobicity of the two strains was observed with increased 
NaCl concentrations. High NaCl concentrations resulted in cell surface damage and
deformation and even slowed the proliferation of the strains, and led to
significant shifts in amide A and amide III groups in proteins and the C-H
stretching of >CH2 in fatty acids (P < 0.05). In summary, appropriate NaCl
concentrations (2 and 4%) improved the antioxidant activity of the two strains,
while the higher NaCl concentrations (6%) decreased their antioxidant activity,
which may be due to the associated changes in the cell surface structural
properties of the two strains.
