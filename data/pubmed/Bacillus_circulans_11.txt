N-Acetyllactosamine (LacNAc; Galβ4GlcNAc) is a typical disaccharide ligand of
galectins. The most abundant members of these human lectins, galectin-1 (Gal-1)
and galectin-3 (Gal-3), participate in a number of pathologies including
cancerogenesis and metastatic formation. In this study, we synthesized a series
of fifteen N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA)-based glycopolymers with
varying LacNAc amounts and presentations and evaluated the impact of their
architecture on the binding affinity to Gal-1 and Gal-3. The controlled radical
reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer copolymerization technique
afforded linear polymer precursors with comparable molecular weight (Mn ≈ 22,000 
g mol-1) and narrow dispersity (D̵ ≈ 1.1). The precursors were conjugated with
the functionalized LacNAc disaccharide (4-22 mol % content in glycopolymer)
prepared by enzymatic synthesis under catalysis by β-galactosidase from Bacillus 
circulans. The structure-affinity relationship study based on the enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay revealed that the type of LacNAc presentation, individual or 
clustered on bi- or trivalent linkers, brings a clear discrimination (almost
300-fold) between Gal-1 and Gal-3, reaching avidity to Gal-1 in the nanomolar
range. Whereas Gal-1 strongly preferred a dense presentation of individually
distributed LacNAc epitopes, Gal-3 preferred a clustered LacNAc presentation.
Such a strong galectin preference based just on the structure of a multivalent
glycopolymer type is exceptional. The prepared nontoxic, nonimmunogenic, and
biocompatible glycopolymers are prospective for therapeutic applications
requiring selectivity for one particular galectin.
