Arabinoxylan (AX), an important dietary fiber from cereal grains, is mainly
metabolised in the large intestine by gut bacteria, especially bifidobacteria.
This study investigated the uptake and metabolism of wheat AX by a
Bifidobacterium longum strain that could grow well with AX as the sole carbon
source. The bacterial growth rate showed a significant correlation to the
molecular weight (MW) of AX and its acid hydrolysates. Assessment of the key AX
degrading enzymes suggested that the uptake and consumption of AX involved
extracellular cleavage of xylan backbone and intracellular degradation of both
the backbone and the arabinose substitution. The preference for native or
partially hydrolysed AX with single substitutions and a sufficiently high MW
suggested the structure-dependant uptake by the bacterial cells. Genetic analysis
of B. longum showed the lack of β-xylosidase, suggesting the existence of unknown
enzymes or dual/multiple-specific enzymes for hydrolysis of the non-reducing end 
of xylan backbone.
