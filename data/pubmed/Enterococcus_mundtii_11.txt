In the present work, the production of bioemulsifier (BE) by a lactic acid
bacterium (LAB) grown at 25 °C in lactic whey-based media for 24 h was evaluated.
Maximum production was detected in a medium containing yeast extract, peptone and
lactic whey (LAPLW medium), with a yield of 270 mg L-1. The BE proved to be more 
innocuous for Caco-2 cells, used as a toxicological indicator, than the non-ionic
surfactant Triton X-100. In addition, the microbial product presented higher
stability to changes in temperature (37 °C to 100 °C), pH (2-10), and salt
concentration (5% and 20%, w/v) than the synthetic surfactant. Regarding
emulsifying capacity tested against different hydrophobic substrates (kerosene,
motor oil, diesel, sunflower oil, and grape oil), the BE displayed E24 values
similar to or even better than those of Triton X-100. Finally, Triton X-100
caused irreversible modifications on the giant unilamellar vesicles (used as
model membrane system), promoting the solubilization of the lipid bilayers.
Nevertheless, BE induced temporary modifications of the membrane, which is
associated with incorporation of the bioproduct in the outer layer. These results
demonstrate the role of BE in biological processes, including reversible changes 
in microbial membranes to enhance the access to hydrophobic substrates.
