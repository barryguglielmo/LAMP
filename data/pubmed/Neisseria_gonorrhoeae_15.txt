We identified and characterized the first two Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains with 
high-level azithromycin resistance isolated in Japan. These were in the clade of 
ceftriaxone- and azithromycin-resistant strains isolated in Australia and the UK.
The MLST, NG-MAST and NG-STAR types of these strains were found in gonococci from
eastern Asia.
