This study focused on investigating reactor performance, simultaneous
methanogeneis and denitrifiction (SMD) process for treatment of a sulfate plus
organic sulfur - rich 3,4,5-Triethoxybenzaldehyde (TMBA) manufacturing wastewater
with variable COD/TSO42- (total sulfate) ratio by micro-electric field-
zero-valent-iron (ZVI) UASB for 390 days. The initial COD/TSO42- was set as 1.42,
0.9 and 0.5, respectively by manually introducing sulfate. The experimental
results indicated that micro-electric field- zero-valent-iron UASB was an
attractive integrated option for satisfactory COD removal, nitrate reduction and 
a reasonable methane yield rate even at COD/TSO42- as low as 0.9. Further
declining the COD/TSO42- to 0.5 can result in a moderate inhibition of SMD
process. The behavior of organic S release was not inhibited over the entire
experimental period. Thus, surprisingly, sulfate concentration in the effluent
was always higher than that in the influent. In comparison with sludge sample at 
Day-1, sludge at Day-390 was characterized with high abundant Tissierella
Soehngenia, Anaerolinaceae and Brevundimonas diminuta, which played critical role
in promising performance in COD abatement. The relatively low abundance of
sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) such as Desulfobulbus and Desulfomicrobium can
explain the lower sulfate reduction efficiency in term of high concentration of
sulfate plus released from organic S-rich compounds.
