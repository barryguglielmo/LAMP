BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic C. difficile colonization is believed to predispose to
subsequent C. difficile infection (CDI). While emerging insights into the role of
the commensal microbiota in mediating colonization resistance against C.
difficile have associated CDI with specific microbial components, corresponding
prospectively collected data on colonization with C. difficile are largely
unavailable.
METHODS: C. difficile status was assessed by GDH EIA and real-time PCR targeting 
the toxin A (tcdA) and B (tcdB) genes. 16S V3 and V4 gene sequencing results from
fecal samples of patients tested positive for C. difficile were analyzed by
assessing alpha and beta diversity, LefSe, and the Piphillin functional inference
approach to estimate functional capacity.
RESULTS: 1506 patients were recruited into a prospective observational study
(DRKS00005335) upon admission into one of five academic hospitals. 936 of them
provided fecal samples on admission and at discharge and were thus available for 
longitudinal analysis. Upon hospital admission, 5.5% (83/1506) and 3.7% (56/1506)
of patients were colonized with toxigenic (TCD) and non-toxigenic C. difficile
(NTCD), respectively. During hospitalization, 1.7% (16/936) acquired TCD. Risk
factors for acquisition of TCD included pre-existing lung diseases, lower GI
endoscopy and antibiotics. Species protecting against hospital-related C.
difficile acquisition included Gemmiger spp., Odoribacter splanchnicus,
Ruminococcus bromii and other Ruminococcus spp.. Metagenomic pathway analysis
identified steroid biosynthesis as the most underrepresented metabolic pathway in
patients who later acquire C. difficile colonization.
CONCLUSIONS: Gemmiger spp., Odoribacter splanchnicus, Ruminococcus bromii and
other Ruminococci were associated with a decreased risk of C. difficile
acquisition.
