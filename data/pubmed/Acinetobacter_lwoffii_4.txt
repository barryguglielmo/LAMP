A new petroleum-degrading bacterium, designated strain GC2T, was isolated from
Bozkuş 1 petroleum station in Diyarbakir, located in the southeast of Turkey.
Cells were Gram-negative staining, aerobic, coccoid-rods, non-motile,
non-spore-forming. The bacterium was found to degrade 100% of n-alkanes ranging
from C11 to C34 presented in the 1% crude oil after incubation of 7 days. The
membrane phospholipids were 1,2 diacylglycero-3-phosphorylethanolamine (PEA),
phosphatidylglycerol (PG), dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerol 1- phosphocholine (PC1), 1,2
dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine monohydrate (PC3), cardiolipin also
called diphosphatidylglycerol (CL) and l-α- phosphatidic acid, dipalmitoyl (AP); 
predominant respiratory ubiquinone was Q-8 and C16:0, C18:1ω9c and C16:1 were the
major cellular fatty acids. The 16S rRNA sequence analysis revealed that the
strain GC2T was a member of genus Acinetobacter and was most closely related to
Acinetobacter lwoffii DSM 2403 T (99.79%), Acinetobacter pseudolwoffii ANC 5318 T
(98.83%) and Acinetobacter harbinensis HITLi 7 T (98.14%). The rpoB and gyrB gene
sequence analysis confirmed that the strain GC2T was a member of genus
Acinetobacter and that the closest relative was Acinetobacter lwoffii DSM 2403 T 
(99.08% and 100% similarity, respectively). DNA-DNA hybridization values between 
GC2T and its closest relatives ranged from 65.6% (with A. lwoffii) to 5.1% (with 
A. venetianus). The whole genome sequence of strain GC2T was obtained. The DNA
G + C content of this strain was determined to be 42.9 mol %. ANI indexes, in
silico estimations of DDH values and wet lab DDH values demonstrated that strain 
GC2T represents an independent genomospecies. On the basis of phenotypic
characteristics, chemotaxonomic, phylogenetic data and DNA-DNA hybridization and 
whole genome analysis, we propose to assign strain GC2T as a new species of the
genus Acinetobacter, for which the name Acinetobacter mesopotamicus sp. nov. is
proposed. The type strain of this species is GC2T (DSM 26953 T = JCM 31073 T).
The whole genome of strain GC2T has been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the 
accession JAALFF010000000.
