Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is the cause of
paratuberculosis mainly in domestic and wild ruminants; paratuberculosis is also 
known as Johne's disease. This disease is endemic all over the world generating
significant economic losses, especially in dairy herds, although, MAP is the
cause of infection in many other species including primates. Currently, MAP
mycobacteria are recognized as pathogens transmitted by food. They are a
potential threat to animal and human health. Infected animals excreting
mycobacteria with faeces are the main source of MAP. The development of control
strategies and disease control are based on determination of the genetic
diversity of the MAP strains causing Johne's disease. This study describes 43
strains isolated from a herd of dairy cows located in northern Poland. The types 
of MAP were determinted based on the polymorphism analysis of two insertion
fragments: IS900 and IS1311. The polymorphism of IS900 was analyzed with the use 
of a PCR multiplex according to Collins' method and the IS1311 polymorphism with 
the use of the PCR-REA method. Based on the differences observed, the strains
isolated were classified into two MAP types, cattle (C-type) and sheep (S-type), 
with the predominance of the cattle type.
