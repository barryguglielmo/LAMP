INTRODUCTION: Non-Tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) are opportunistic environmental 
pathogens that can produce a wide range of diseases, including infection of the
skin and soft tissues. Mycobacterium fortuitum is a predominant causative agent
of postsurgical wound infection, especially in breast surgery. Peri-prosthetic
infection due to Mycobacterium fortuitum are uncommon, but increasingly reported.
This report summarizes the case of a young healthy female who underwent bilateral
breast mastopexy with insertion of silicone implants. Shortly after the procedure
she presented with clinical signs of wound infection that failed to heal
completely in spite of repeated drainage and empiric antibiotic therapy.
Additional microbiological investigation allowed for a diagnosis of Mycobacterium
fortuitum. A prolonged course of anti-mycobacterial therapy, combined with
removal of the implants initiated eradication of the infection and enabled
re-implantation of the prosthesis. This case report underscores the importance of
awareness to this type of pathogen especially in cases of exudative infection
with sterile cultures. Timely identification can lead to prompt therapy of
patients preventing further complications, costs and remaining aesthetic damage.
