Peritonitis is a severe complication encountered in patients undergoing
peritoneal dialysis, often causing high morbidity and mortality. High vigilance
is required from healthcare providers involved in the management of these
patients to prevent this complication. There has been recognition of peritonitis 
caused by unusual organisms because of improved microbiological detection
techniques. Gram-positive organisms are the frequent cause of peritonitis
compared to Gram-negative organisms. We report a rare case of peritonitis caused 
by Enterococcus avium. A 60-year-old male on peritoneal dialysis presented with
palpitations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and cloudy effluent. The peritoneal fluid
analysis was consistent with peritonitis, and peritoneal fluid culture grew E.
avium. The patient was treated with linezolid after failing to respond to
vancomycin. The peritoneal dialysis catheter was removed, and the dialysis
modality has been switched to hemodialysis because of refractory peritonitis.
