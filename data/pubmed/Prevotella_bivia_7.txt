The aetiology of bacterial vaginosis (BV) is not well-understood, and prevalence 
appears to be higher among women living in sub-Saharan Africa. A recent
conceptual model implicates three main bacteria (Gardnerella vaginalis; Atopobium
vaginae; and Prevotella bivia), sexual activity, sialidase activity, and biofilm 
formation in the pathogenesis of BV. We describe the vaginal microbiota, presence
of the putative sialidase A gene of G. vaginalis, and biofilm among 386
adolescent girls aged 17 and 18 years in a cross-sectional study in Mwanza,
Tanzania around the time of expected sexual debut. Vaginal swabs were collected
and tested by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for five
Lactobacillus species, G. vaginalis, A. vaginae, P. bivia, the sialidase A gene
of G. vaginalis, and by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) for evidence of
G. vaginalis and A. vaginae biofilm. We conducted a risk factor analysis of G.
vaginalis, A. vaginae and P. bivia, and explored the associations between
biofilm, the presence of the sialidase A gene, and non-optimal vaginal microbiota
(Nugent 4-7). L. crispatus and L. iners were detected in 69 and 82% of girls,
respectively. The prevalence of L. crispatus was higher than previously reported 
in earlier studies among East and Southern African women. G. vaginalis, A.
vaginae, P. bivia were independently associated with reported penile-vaginal sex.
Samples with all three BV-associated bacteria made up the highest proportion of
samples with Nugent-BV compared to samples with each bacterium alone or together 
in pairs. Of the 238 girls with G. vaginalis, 63% had the sialidase A gene
detected, though there was no difference by reported sexual activity (p = 0.197).
Of the 191 girls with results for sialidase A gene and FISH, there was strong
evidence for an increased presence of sialidase A gene among those with evidence 
of a biofilm (p < 0.001). There was a strong association between biofilm and
non-optimal microbiota (aOR67.00; 95% CI 26.72-190.53). These results support
several of the steps outlined in the conceptual model, although the role of
sexual activity is less clear. We recommend longitudinal studies to better
understand changes in vaginal microbiota and biofilm formation around the time of
sexual debut.
