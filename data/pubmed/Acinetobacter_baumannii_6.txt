We report the case of a 53-year-old male that presented to our hospital with a
history of a brain tumour. He was hospitalized 10 days prior in another hospital.
Before surgery, he complained of mild cough. Routine chest radiography
demonstrated right upper lobe consolidation which was diagnosed as
hospital-acquired pneumonia. Broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobial was
initiated. After surgery, his clinical condition deteriorated and he felt
breathlessness. Chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) scan without
contrast revealed necrotizing and cavitating pneumonia complicated by
bronchopleural fistula (BPF) and hydropneumothorax. Sputum culture revealed
infection of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB). Despite optimal
antibiotic therapy, BPF and hydropneumothorax failed to resolve and surgical
approach was performed to debride the necrotic area and seal the fistula. After a
month in the hospital, he was discharged and the serial chest X-ray showed good
recovery of the lung.
