We describe here the complete genome sequence of an Enterobacter hormaechei ST279
coharbouring blaVIM-1 and mcr-9 recovered from uncooked beef patty in June 2017, 
Egypt. The tested isolate was resistant to carbapenem but susceptible to colistin
(minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), 0.5 μg/mL). The antimicrobial
susceptibility profile and conjugation experiments were performed. The entire
genome was sequenced by the Illumina MiniSeq and Oxford Nanopore methods. The
blaVIM-1 and mcr-9 genes are carried on the same IncHI2/pMLST1 plasmid, pMS37a
(Size of 270.9 kb). The mcr-9 gene was located within the physical boundaries
demarcated by two insertion elements IS903 (upstream) and IS1 (downstream) but
did not possess the downstream regulatory genes (qseC/qseB) which regulate the
expression of mcr-9. Therefore, the mcr-9 might be silently disseminated among
carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales. In addition to blaVIM-1 and mcr-9, plasmid
pMS37a harbored various antibiotic resistance genes including aac(6')-Il,
ΔaadA22, aac(6')-Ib-cr, sul1, dfrA1 and tetA. To the best of our knowledge, this 
is the first report of a blaVIM-1 and mcr-9-coharbouring E. hormaechei isolate of
food origin worldwide. The identification of a multidrug-resistant VIM-1 and
mcr-9 positive Enterobacter hormaechei isolate from food is worrisome as retail
meat and meat products could serve as a vehicle for these MDR bacteria, which
could be transferred between animals and humans through the food chain. It
further highlights that Enterobacterales co-producing MCR and carbapenemases
being found in the food chain indeed correspond to a One-Health issue,
highlighting the need for serious steps to prevent their further dissemination.
