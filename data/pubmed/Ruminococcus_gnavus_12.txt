BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota participates in the metabolism of substances and
energy, promotes the development and maturation of the immune system, forms the
mucosal barrier, and protects the host from pathogen attacks. Although the
pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstones is still not clear, studies have suggested
that gut microbiota dysbiosis plays an important role in their formation.
METHODS: Microbial DNA from faeces of normal control patients and those of
patients with calculi was subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing to detect gene
expression changes in intestinal microbes. ELISA kits were used to measure free
bile acids, secondary bile acids and coprostanol according to the manufacturer's 
instructions. The relationship between flora and their metabolites was then
analysed.
RESULTS: In the gallstone group, the diversity of intestinal bacteria and the
abundances of certain phylogroups were significantly decreased (p < 0.05),
especially Firmicutes (p < 0.05), the largest phylum represented by the gut
microbiota. This study found an increase in free bile acids (p < 0.001) and
secondary bile acids (p < 0.01) in the enterohepatic circulation. Bile salt
hydrolase activity was not related to the abundances of BSH-active bacteria.
7a-dehydroxylating gut bacteria were significantly increased (p < 0.01), whereas 
cholesterol-lowering bacteria were significantly reduced (p < 0.05). The
Ruminococcus gnavus group could be used as a biomarker to distinguish the
gallstone group from the control group.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that intestinal flora imbalance affects bile acid and
cholesterol metabolism and is associated with gallstone formation.
