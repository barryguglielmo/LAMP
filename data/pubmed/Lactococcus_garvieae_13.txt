Lactococcus garvieae is a fish pathogen, rarely causing opportunistic infections 
in humans. There are only a few cases reported in the literature, mainly
endocarditis, suggesting an association with raw fish consumption. We report a
case of a periprosthetic hip infection successfully treated with a two-stage
revision surgery.
