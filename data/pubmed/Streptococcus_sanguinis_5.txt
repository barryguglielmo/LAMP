In order to investigate the effects of mouthwashes on oral biofilms with
probiotics, we compared in biofilms the susceptibility to mouthwashes of
probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and oral pathogens Streptococcus
mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Candida albicans. We also evaluated these
pathogens' susceptibility to the mouthwashes and their recovery after
mouthwash-rinsing in biofilms with/without LGG. First, 1-day-/3-day-old
LGG-integrated multi-species biofilms were exposed for 1 min to mouthwashes
containing chlorhexidine, essential oils, or amine fluoride/stannous fluoride.
Cells were plate-counted and relative survival rates (RSRs) of LGG and pathogens 
calculated. Second, 1-day-/3-day-old multispecies biofilms with and without LGG
were exposed for 1 min to mouthwashes; cells were plate-counted and the
pathogens' RSRs were calculated. Third, 1-day-old biofilms were treated for 1 min
with mouthwashes. Cells were plate-counted immediately and after 2-day
cultivation. Recovery rates of pathogens were calculated and compared between
biofilms with/without LGG. Live/DeadÂ® staining served for structural analyses.
Our results showed that RSRs of LGG were insignificantly smaller than those of
pathogens in both 1-day and 3-day biofilms. No significant differences appeared
in pathogens' RSRs and recovery rates after treatment between biofilms
with/without LGG. To conclude, biofilm LGG was susceptible to the mouthwashes;
but biofilm LGG altered neither the mouthwash effects on oral pathogens nor
affected their recovery.
