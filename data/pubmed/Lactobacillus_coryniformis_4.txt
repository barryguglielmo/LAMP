AIMS: To investigate the changes in fermentation quality of whole-plant corn
silage ensiled with varying dosages of mixed organic acid salts (MS), and link
these dosage changes to shifts in bacterial composition.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Fermentation quality and bacterial community of corn silage 
ensiled with MS at four application rates (0, 0·67 g kg-1 , 1·33 g kg-1 , and
2·00 g kg-1 ) were investigated. The MS consisted of 40% potassium sorbate and
60% sodium benzoate. The corn silages were conserved for 42 days. Dry matter
losses and ammonia nitrogen concentration were linearly declined by up to 19·10
and 33·3% with increasing dosages of MS. MS treatments significantly reduced the 
pH of silage vs the control group. Further analysis indicated that the
improvement of fermentation quality was the result of shifts in bacterial
composition, the relative abundance of Lactobacillus paralimentarius and
Pediococcus spp. increased while Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus
coryniformis and Klebsiella declined with increasing dosages of MS.
CONCLUSIONS: MS effectively improved the fermentation quality of whole-plant corn
silage with an optimum dosage of 2·00 g kg-1 .
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The correlation between bacterial taxa and 
fermentation quality provides a potential for the development of novel silage
inoculants and for the application of MS on controlling Klebsiella mastitis of
livestock farms.
