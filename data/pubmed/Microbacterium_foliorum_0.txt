Seven EA cluster microbacteriophages were isolated from soil collected around
Philadelphia, PA, using the bacterial host Microbacterium foliorum All of these
phages have a highly conserved genome with regions of diversity localized to the 
3' end. In phage Phriends (EA1 cluster), this region contains an orpham gene with
no known function.
