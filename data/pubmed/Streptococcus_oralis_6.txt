Oral microbiomes vary in cariogenic potential; these differences may be
established early in life. A major concern is whether mothers transmit cariogenic
bacteria to their children. Here we characterize early salivary microbiome
development and the potential associations of that development with route of
delivery, breastfeeding, and mother's oral health, and we evaluate transmission
of microbes between mother and child. We analyzed saliva and metadata from the
Center for Oral Health Research in Appalachia. For this cohort study, we
sequenced the V6 region of the 16S rRNA gene and used quantitative polymerase
chain reaction to detect Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sobrinus,
Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, and Candida albicans in the saliva
from mothers and their infants, collected at 2, 9, and 12 mo (Pennsylvania site) 
and 2, 12, and 24 mo (West Virginia site). Breastfed children had lower relative 
abundances of Prevotella and Veillonella. If mothers had decayed, missing, or
filled teeth, children had greater abundances of Veillonella and Actinomyces.
There was little evidence of maternal transmission of selected microbes. At
12 mo, children's microbiomes were more similar to other children's than to their
mothers'. Infants' salivary microbiomes became more adult-like with age but still
differed with mothers' microbiomes at 12 mo. There was little evidence supporting
transmission of selected microbes from mothers to children, but risk of
colonization was associated with tooth emergence. Children are likely to acquire 
cariogenic bacteria from a variety of sources, including foods and contact with
other children and adults.
