BACKGROUND: Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguinis are Gram-positive
bacteria that cause dental caries. The MurA enzyme is a catalyst in the formation
of peptidoglycan in the bacterial cell wall making it ideal as an antibacterial
target. Basil (Ocimum americanum) is an edible plant medicine that diverse, very 
widely spreading, used as herbal for a long time, and it was reported to have
pharmacology effect as antibacterial activity. The purpose of this study is to
identify antibacterial compounds from O. americanum and analyze their inhibition 
activity to the MurA enzyme.
METHODS: Fresh leaves from O. americanum extracted with n-hexane and purified by 
a combination of column chromatography on normal and reverse phase together with 
guided by in vitro bioactivity assay against S. mutans ATCC 25175 and S.
sanguinis ATCC 10556, respectively, while in silico molecular docking simulation 
of lauric acid (1) using PyRx 0.8.
RESULTS: The structure determination of antibacterial compound by spectroscopic
methods resulted in an active compound 1 as lauric acid. The in vitro evaluation 
of antibacterial activity compound 1 showed the MIC and MBC of 78.13 & 156.3 ppm 
and 1250 & 2500 ppm against S. sanguinis and in S. mutans, respectively. Further 
analysis in silico evaluation as MurA Enzyme inhibitor, lauric acid (1) has a
binding affinity of -5.2 Kcal/mol those higher than fosfomycin.
CONCLUSION: The lauric acid has potency as a new natural antibacterial agent
through the MurA inhibition in bacterial cell wall biosynthesis.
