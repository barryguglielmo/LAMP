BACKGROUND: Treatment of gonorrhea is complicated by the development of
antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) to the antibiotics
recommended for treatment. Knowledge on types of plasmids and the antibiotic
resistance genes they harbor is useful in monitoring the emergence and spread of 
bacterial antibiotic resistance. In Kenya, studies on gonococcal antimicrobial
resistance are few and data on plasmid mediated drug resistance is limited. The
present study characterizes plasmid mediated resistance in N. gonorrhoeae
isolates recovered from Kenya between 2013 and 2018.
METHODS: DNA was extracted from 36 sub-cultured GC isolates exhibiting varying
drug resistance profiles. Whole genome sequencing was done on Illumina MiSeq
platform and reads assembled de-novo using CLC Genomics Workbench. Genome
annotation was performed using Rapid Annotation Subsystem Technology. Comparisons
in identified antimicrobial resistance determinants were done using Bioedit
sequence alignment editor.
RESULTS: Twenty-four (66.7%) isolates had both β-lactamase (TEM) and TetM
encoding plasmids. 8.3% of the isolates lacked both TEM and TetM plasmids and had
intermediate to susceptible penicillin and tetracycline MICs. Twenty-six (72%)
isolates harbored TEM encoding plasmids. 25 of the TEM plasmids were of African
type while one was an Asian type. Of the 36 isolates, 31 (86.1%) had TetM
encoding plasmids, 30 of which harbored American TetM, whereas 1 carried a Dutch 
TetM. All analyzed isolates had non-mosaic penA alleles. All the isolates
expressing TetM were tetracycline resistant (MIC> 1 mg/L) and had increased
doxycycline MICs (up to 96 mg/L). All the isolates had S10 ribosomal protein V57M
amino acid substitution associated with tetracycline resistance. No relation was 
observed between PenB and MtrR alterations and penicillin and tetracycline MICs.
CONCLUSION: High-level gonococcal penicillin and tetracycline resistance in the
sampled Kenyan regions was found to be mediated by plasmid borne blaTEM and tetM 
genes. While the African TEM plasmid, TEM1 and American TetM are the dominant
genotypes, Asian TEM plasmid, a new TEM239 and Dutch TetM have emerged in the
regions.
