The effects of teeth-blackening bacteria Enterobacter ludwigii on the
physiological system were investigated using the model organism Drosophila
melanogaster. The bacteria were mixed with the fly food, and its effect was
checked on the growth, development and behaviour of Drosophila. Microbes generate
reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the haemolymph of the larvae once it enters 
into the body. The increased amount of ROS was evidenced by the NBT assay and
using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate dye, which indicates the mitochondrial
ROS. The increased amount of ROS resulted in a number of abnormal nuclei within
the gut. Besides that larvae walking became sluggish in comparison with wild type
although the larvae crawling path did not change much. Flies hatched from the
infectious larvae have the posterior scutellar bristle absent from the thorax and
abnormal mechanosensory hairs in the eye, and they undergo time-dependent
neurodegeneration as evidenced by the geotrophic and phototrophic assays. To
decipher the mechanism of neurodegeneration, flies were checked for the presence 
of four important bioamines: tyramine, cadaverine, putrescine and histamine. Out 
of these four, histamine was found to be absent in infected flies. Histamine is a
key molecule required for the functioning of the photoreceptor as well as
mechanoreceptors. The mechanism via which mouth infectious bacteria E. ludwigii
can affect the development and cause age-dependent neurodegeneration is explained
in this paper.
