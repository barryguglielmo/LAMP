Ranthipeptides, defined as radical non-α thioether-containing peptides, are a
newly emerging class of natural products belonging to the ribosomally synthesized
and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) superfamily. Ranthipeptides are 
shown to be widespread in the bacterial kingdom, whereas heretofore their
biological functions remain completely elusive. In this work, putative
ranthipeptides are investigated from two solventogenic clostridia, Clostridium
beijerinckii and Clostridium ljungdahlii, which are derived from the so-called
six Cys in forty-five residues (SCIFF) family of precursor peptides. A series of 
analysis show that these two ranthipeptides participate in quorum sensing and
controlling cellular metabolism. These results highlight the diverse biological
functions of the ever-increasing family of RiPP natural products and showcase the
potential to engineer industrially interesting organisms by manipulating their
RiPP biosynthetic pathways.
