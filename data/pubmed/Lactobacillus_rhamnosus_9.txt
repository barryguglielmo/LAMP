BACKGROUND: The origin of most of the Lactobacillus rhamnosus genome sequences
lodged in NCBI can be traced to food and faecal isolates followed by blood and
tissue sites but with minimal representation from oral and vaginal isolates.
However, on the L. rhamnosus phylogenetic tree no apparent clade is linked to the
origin of isolation or to the relevant clinical source, except for a distinct
clade exclusively shared by L. rhamnosus isolates from early stages of dental
pulp infection (LRHMDP2 and LRHMDP3) and from bronchoalveolar lavage (699_LRHA
and 708_LRHA) from a critical care patient. These L. rhamnosus strains, LRHMDP2, 
LRHMDP3, 699_LRHA and 708_LRHA isolated from different continents, display
closest genome neighbour gapped identity of 99.95%. The aim of this study was to 
define a potentially unique complement of genes of clinical relevance shared
between these L. rhamnosus clinical isolates in comparison to probiotic L.
rhamnosus strains.
RESULTS: In this analysis we used orthologous protein identification tools such
as ProteinOrtho followed by tblastn alignments to identify a novel tyrosine
protein phosphatase (wzb)-tyrosine-protein kinase modulator EpsC (wzd)- synteny
exopolysaccharide (EPS) cluster. This EPS cluster was specifically conserved in a
clade of 5 clinical isolates containing the four L. rhamnosus clinical isolates
noted above and Lactobacillus spp. HMSC077C11, a clinical isolate from a neck
abscess. The EPS cluster was shared with only two other strains, L. rhamnosus
BPL5 and BPL15, which formed a distant clade on the L. rhamnosus phylogenetic
tree, with a closest genome neighbour gapped identity of 97.51% with L. rhamnosus
LRHMDP2 and LRHMDP3. Exclusivity of this EPS cluster (from those identified
before) was defined by five EPS genes, which were specifically conserved between 
the clade of 5 clinical isolates and L. rhamnosus BPL5 and BPL15 when compared to
the remaining L. rhamnosus strains. Comparative genome analysis between the clade
of 5 clinical isolates and L. rhamnosus BPL5 and BPL15 showed a set of 58
potentially unique genes characteristic of the clade of 5.
CONCLUSION: The potentially unique functional protein orthologs associated with
the clade of 5 clinical isolates may provide understanding of fitness under
selective pressure.
