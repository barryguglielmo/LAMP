Staphylococcus hyicus, considered as a leading pathogen of exudative epidermitis,
is a serious threat to humans and animals. The emergency of bacterial resistance 
to antibiotics, especially in human and animal health fields, leads to an urgent 
need of exploration of new antimicrobial agents. In this study, NZX, a
plectasin-derived peptide, was firstly expressed in Pichia pastoris X-33 and was 
purified by cation exchange chromatography, followed by detection of its
antibacterial activity in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that the total
secreted protein concentration in fermentation supernatant was up to 2820 mg/L
(29 °C) after 120-h induction in a 5-L fermentor. The yield of NZX reached up to 
965 mg/L with a purity of 92.6%. The recombinant expressed NZX had a strong
antimicrobial activity, high stability, and low toxicity. The minimal inhibitory 
concentrations (MICs) of NZX and ceftriaxone (CRO) against Gram-positive bacteria
were 0.46 to 0.91 μM and 6.04 to 12.09 μM, respectively. The time-killing curves 
showed that S. hyicus NCTC10350 was killed completely by 2× and 4 × MIC of NZX
within 24 h. NZX also exhibited the intracellular activity against S. hyicus in
Hacat cells. After treatment with NZX (10 mg/kg) and CRO (60 mg/kg), the survival
rates of mice were 100% and 83.3%, respectively. NZX inhibited the bacterial
translocation, downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α/IL-1β/IL-6),
upregulated the anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10), and ameliorated
multiple-organ injuries (the liver, spleen, lung, and kidney). This study
provides evidence that the expressed NZX has the potential to become a powerful
candidate as novel antimicrobial agents against S. hyicus infections.
