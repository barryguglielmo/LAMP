Azo dyes pose hazards to ecosystems and human health and the cosubstrate strategy
has become the focus for the bioremediation of azo dyes. Herein, Brilliant
Crocein (BC), a model pollutant, was biodegraded by Providencia rettgeri
domesticated from activated sludge. Additional ethanol, as a cosubstrate, could
accelerate P. rettgeri growth and BC biodegradation, as reflected by the Gompertz
models. This phenomenon was attributed to the smaller metabolites and greater
number of potential pathways observed under the synergistic effect of ethanol.
Genomic analysis of P. rettgeri showed that functional genes related to azo bond 
cleavage, redox reactions, ring opening and hydrolysis played crucial roles in
azo dye biodegradation. Furthermore, the mechanism proposed was that ethanol
might stimulate the production of additional reducing power via the expression of
related genes, leading to the cleavage of azo bonds and aromatic rings. However, 
biodegradation without ethanol could only partly cleave the azo bonds.
