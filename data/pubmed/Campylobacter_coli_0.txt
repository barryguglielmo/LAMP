OBJECTIVES: This report describes the first identification of twoCampylobacter
isolates harbouring erm(B) in Australia.
METHODS: Twoerm(B)+ isolates, C. coli 18V1065H1 and C. jejuni 19W1001H1, were
isolated from diarrheal fecal samples from two travellers who had recently
returned from Southeast Asia. Isolates were whole genome sequenced using an
Illumina NextSeq and analysed with the Nullarbor pipeline. Antimicrobial
resistance genes were identified using NCBI's AMRFinderPlus and sequence types
were determined using multilocus sequence typing and the PubMLST Campylobacter
jejuni/coli typing scheme.
RESULTS: In addition toerm(B), C. jejuni 19W1001H1 possessed six other resistance
genes, aad9, aadE, aph(3')-Illa, blaOXA-185, CatA13 and tet(O), the T86I mutation
(gyrA) and the RE-CmeABC multidrug efflux pump variant. C. coli 18V1065H1 also
possessed six resistance genes, aad9, aadE, aph(3')-IIIa, blaOXA-61, sat4 and
tet(O), in addition to erm(B). However, this isolate lacked genetic evidence for 
resistance to fluoroquinolones (no gyrA mutation) and the erm(B) locus differed
between isolates and neither was identical to previously identified erm(B)
multidrug resistance genomic island (MDRGI) types. Both erm(B) bearing isolates
belonged to novel sequence types ST9967 (C. jejuni 19W1001H1) and ST10161 (C.
coli 18V1065H1).
CONCLUSION: This study detected the presence oferm(B) in Campylobacter for the
first time in Australia. This novel mechanism of macrolide resistance is a major 
concern for both human and animal health and warrants close surveillance as
macrolides are often the drug of choice for treating campylobacteriosis. The
erm(B) gene is associated with several MDRGIs and dissemination of this
resistance mechanism will likely limit treatment options for Campylobacter
infections.
