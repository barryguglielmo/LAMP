PURPOSE: To evaluate bacterial agents as cancer biomarkers.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Various bacterial species have been demonstrated to involve 
in human cancers. However, the data is not enough for better understanding of
predominant specific species. Application of a rapid and early-diagnostic,
cost-effective, non-invasive, and inclusive method is a crucial approach for
obtaining valid results. The role of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in gastric
and duodenal cancer has been confirmed. From investigation among previous
publications, we attempted to make it clear which bacterial species significantly
and specifically increase in various cancer types. It was unraveled that there is
significant change in Granulicatella adiacens (G. adiacens) in lung cancer (LC), 
Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) in colorectal cancer (CRC), H. pylori and 
Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) in pancreatic cancer, and Streptococcus 
spp. in oral cancer.
CONCLUSION: Alteration in the cell cycle by means of different mechanisms such as
inflammation, alteration in cell signaling, invasion and immune evasion, specific
niche colonization, induction of DNA damage and mutation, expression of some
microRNAs, and enhancing epigenetic effects are the most common mechanisms
employed by bacterial species.
