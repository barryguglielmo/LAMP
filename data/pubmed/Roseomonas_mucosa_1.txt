Ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) is an adequate treatment for congenital
hydrocephalus or chronic hydrocephalus in adults. Yet, it is a surgery associated
with a significant rate of complications amongst neurosurgical procedures, with
frequent shunt obstructions and infections. We report the first-ever case of
peritonitis caused by Roseomonas mucosa, shortly after the revision of a VPS
ventricular catheter. Hardware removal and proper antibiotic therapy led to the
patient's recovery. Roseomonas mucosa is an opportunistic skin pathogen with an
antibiotic resistance profile to many beta-lactamines and a tropism for
indwelling catheters and post-operative period. Nowadays, it should be taken into
account in case of infection of indwelling catheters and for some implantable
medical devices.
