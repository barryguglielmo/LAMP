A 21-year-old boy underwent deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) for
advanced keratoconus. Postoperatively, slit lamp examination revealed multiple
foci of interface infiltrates. Medical therapy was non-responsive, and therefore,
a repeat lamellar transplantation was done. Scrapings were taken from host stroma
and under the surface of the initial graft. Microbiological examination, aided by
VITEK-2, revealed the causative organism as Kocuria kristinae. The postoperative 
course was uneventful and at a 1-year follow-up, the graft was clear with no
recurrence of infection. This case highlights the pathogenic potential of Kocuria
species, which has previously been disregarded as a commensal or contaminant.
