Psychrotolerant species of the Bacillus cereus group, Bacillus mycoides and
Bacillus weihenstephanensis, can grow at ≥ 7 °C and are significant concerns for 
the food industry due to their ability to cause spoilage of refrigerated food. In
addition to that, some strains of B. weihenstephanensis can produce emetic toxin,
namely cereulide, which is known to cause vomiting. Therefore, rapid and simple
methods to discriminate psychrotolerant B. cereus group species are crucial.
Here, matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass
spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and the S10-spc-alpha operon gene encoded ribosomal
protein mass spectrum (S10-GERMS) method were used to discriminate
psychrotolerant species of the B. cereus group based on a set of four ribosomal
subunit proteins (S10, S16, S20 and L30). A total of 36 strains of B. cereus
group were cultured on LB agar, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. The four biomarkers
successfully discriminated 12 strains of psychrotolerant species from mesophilic 
species of the B. cereus group. Furthermore, the four biomarkers also classified 
some Bacillus thuringiensis strains. MALDI-TOF MS analysis using the S10-GERMS
method allowed simple and rapid discrimination of psychrotolerant species of the 
B. cereus group from other mesophilic species. This method has a possibility to
enable manufacturers and distributors of refrigerated foods to control
psychrotolerant species of the B. cereus group effectively.
