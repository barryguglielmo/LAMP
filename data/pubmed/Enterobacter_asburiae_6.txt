The rapidly increasing prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae
(CRE) over the past decade has increased concern in healthcare facilities and the
impact on public health. The prevalence of blaKPC (KPC) in Thailand remains very 
low; only blaKPC-13 has been described previously. This study is the first to
describe the characteristics of blaKPC-2-carrying Klebsiella pneumoniae,
Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter asburiae in Thailand. The prevalence rate of
blaKPC-2-carrying isolates was 0.13% among CRE isolates in our study. Based on
carbapenem susceptibility testing, K. pneumoniae C1985 was resistant to meropenem
and ertapenem, E. coli C1992 was resistant to meropenem, imipenem, and ertapenem,
and E. asburiae C2135 was only resistant to imipenem. K. pneumoniae C1985 carried
blaKPC-2, blaSHV-11, fosA, oqxA, and oqxB, while E. coli C1992 contained blaKPC-2
and mdf(A) and E. asburiae C2135 harbored blaKPC-2, blaACT-2, and qnrE1. The
genetic features of blaKPC-2 in the 3 isolates revealed identical rearrangement
and flanking regions. Analysis of genomic sequences from these 3 isolates
revealed that the sequence types of K. pneumoniae C1985, E. coli C1992, and E.
asburiae C2135 were ST4008, ST7297, and ST1249, respectively. The 3 blaKPC-2
isolates were from individual living cases. Two cases were colonization for K.
pneumoniae C1985 and E. asburiae C2135 and the third case was hospital-acquired
infection of E. coli C1992. Although the prevalence of blaKPC-2-carrying CRE is
relatively low in this study, continued surveillance and close monitoring are
warranted. In addition, prompt or early detection of CRE and strict
implementation of infection control are essential to prevent outbreaks or rapid
spread in hospitals.
