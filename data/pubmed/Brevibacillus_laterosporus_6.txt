Myzus persicae, a destructive aphid of tomato usually managed by chemical
pesticides, is responsible for huge annual losses in agriculture. In the current 
work, a protein elicitor, PeBL1, was investigated for its capacity to induce a
defense response against M. persicae in tomato. Population growth rates of M.
persicae (second and third generation) decreased with PeBL1 treatments as
compared with controls. In a host selection assay, M. persicae showed preference 
for colonizing control plants as compared to tomato seedlings treated with PeBL1.
Tomato leaves treated with PeBL1 gave rise to a hazardous surface environment for
M. persicae due to formation of trichomes and wax. Jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic 
acid (SA), and ethylene (ET) showed significant accumulation in tomato seedlings 
treated by PeBL1. The following results showed that PeBL1 significantly modified 
the tomato leaf surface structure to reduce reproduction and deter colonization
by M. persicae. Defense processes also included activation of JA, SA, and ET
pathways. The study provides evidence for use of PeBL1 in the protection of
tomato from M. persicae.
