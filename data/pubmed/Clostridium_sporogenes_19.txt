The Clostridium sp. is a large group of spore-forming, facultative or strictly
anaerobic, Gram-positive bacteria that can produce food poisoning. The table
olive industry is demanding alternative formulations to respond to market demand 
for the reduction of acidity and salt contents in final products. while
maintaining the appearance of freshness of fruits. In this work, logistic
regression models for non-adapted and acid-adapted Clostridium sp. strains were
developed in laboratory medium to study the influence of pH, NaCl (%) and time on
the probability of germination of their spores. A Clostridium sporogenes cocktail
was not able to germinate at pH < 5.0, although the adaptation of the strains
produced an increase in the probability of germination at 5.0-5.5 pH levels and
6% NaCl concentration. At acidic pH values (5.0), the adapted strains germinated 
after 10 days of incubation, while those which were non-adapted required 15 days.
At pH 5.75 and with 4% NaCl, germination of the adapted strains took place before
7 days, while several replicates of the non-adapted strains did not germinate
after 42 days of storage. The model was validated in natural green olive brines
with good results (>81.7% correct prediction cases). The information will be
useful for the industry and administration to assess the safety risk in the
formulation of new processing conditions in table olives and other fermented
vegetables.
