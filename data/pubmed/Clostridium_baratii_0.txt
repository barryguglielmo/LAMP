OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the descriptive epidemiology of infant botulism
(IB),flaccid paralysis that results when neurotoxigenic Clostridium species
produce botulinum toxin (BoNT) in the infant colon, in its first 40 years
following initial recognition in California in 1976.
STUDY DESIGN: Cases were defined by laboratory identification of BoNT and/or
neurotoxigenic Clostridium species in patients' feces. Parents were interviewed
using a structured questionnaire. Descriptive epidemiological characteristics
were compared between 1976-1996 and 1997-2016.
RESULTS: From 1976-2016, 1345 cases of IB occurred in 45 of 58 California
counties (6.5 cases/100,000 live-births/year) caused by BoNT types A, B, Ba, Bf
and F; 88% of cases were ≤6 months of age and 51% were female. Cases were White
(84.2%), Asian (8.9%), Other Races (3.8%), and African-American (2.8%); 29.4% of 
cases were Hispanic. More than 99% of cases were hospitalized. Case occurrence
peaked in summer-fall. Of eight designated geographic regions, the Central Coast 
counties had three times the statewide incidence in both 20-year time periods.
Breast-fed patients (83%) were more than twice as old at onset as formula-fed
patients (median, 4.4 vs. 1.7 months, respectively; P < .001). BoNT/A cases were 
older at onset than BoNT/B cases (median, 3.8 vs 2.9 months, respectively;
P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive continuous surveillance of IB for 40 years in a large,
diversely-populated state identified fundamental epidemiological characteristics 
of this uncommon illness. Unusual features included greater than 99% case
hospitalization, absence of male preponderance, and a distinctive age
distribution.
