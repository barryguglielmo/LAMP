We herein report a case of osteomyelitis of the distal phalanx of the thumb of a 
55-year-old man caused by Parvimonas micra and Fusobacterium nucleatum.
Osteomyelitis often occurs in long bones and rarely occurs in the bones of the
fingers. In addition, osteomyelitis of the finger frequently occurs after trauma 
or surgery, and blood-borne infection is very rare. P. micra and F. nucleatum,
normal flora of the oral cavity, are very rare pathogenic bacteria of
osteomyelitis except in periodontal disease, and there are no previous reports
regarding the occurrence of osteomyelitis due to P. micra and F. nucleatum in the
finger bones.
