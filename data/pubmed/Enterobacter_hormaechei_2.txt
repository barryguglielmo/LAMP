We report the case of a 67-year old man with a right knee prosthetic joint
infection due to extensively drug-resistant Enterobacter hormaechei. The
resistance phenotype was due to the overproduction of the intrinsic
cephalosporinase (ACT-5) associated with the production of three acquired
β-lactamases (CTX-M-15, TEM-1B and OXA-1), and a putative membrane decreased
permeability. He was first treated with colistin-tigecyclin due to adverse drug
reactions; treatment was switched to cefiderocol for a 12-week antibiotic
duration, with a favorable outcome.
