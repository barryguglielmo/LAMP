Two cases of acute postoperative Granulicatella adiacens endophthalmitis
following uneventful phacoemulsification surgery are reported. The cases had
intracameral cefuroxime as antibiotic prophylaxis, visual acuity (VA) was
perception of light and hand movements, respectively, and there was severe
anterior chamber inflammation and dense vitritis with no fundal view. Vitreous
biopsy identified G. adiacens using genome sequencing. Intraoperative findings
included extensive retinal hemorrhages, abscesses, occluded retinal vessels, and 
retinal necrosis. Due to the ischemic retinal appearance, pan-retinal
photocoagulation endolaser was performed. Postoperatively both cases developed
rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) anterior to the laser marks and were
successfully treated. VA improved to 6/18 and 6/60, respectively. Hyperreflective
dots and Henle fibre layer hemorrhage are reported for the first time, to the
authors' knowledge, in association with endophthalmitis. The successful outcome
suggested that intraoperative pan-retinal photocoagulation could be considered in
such ischaemic cases to prevent rubeosis and to reduce the risk of postoperative 
RRD or limit its extent if it recurs.
