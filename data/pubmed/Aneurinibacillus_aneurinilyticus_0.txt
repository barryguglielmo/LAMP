Due to their vast industrial potential, cellulases have been regarded as the
potential biocatalysts by both the academicians and the industrial research
groups. In the present study, culturable bacterial strains of Himalayan Urban
freshwater lake were investigated for cellulose degrading activities. Initially, 
a total of 140 bacterial strains were isolated and only 45 isolates were found to
possess cellulose degrading property. On the basis of preliminary screening
involving cellulase activity assay on CMC agar (with clear zone of hydrolysis)
and biosafety assessment testing, only single isolate named as BKT-9 was selected
for the cellulase production studies. Strain BKT-9 was characterized at the
molecular level using rRNA gene sequencing and its sequence homology analysis
revealed its identity as Aneurinibacillus aneurinilyticus. Further, various
physico-chemical parameters and culture conditions were optimized using one
factor approach to enhance cellulase production levels in the strain BKT-9.
Subsequently, RSM based statistical optimization led to formulation of cellulase 
production medium, wherein the bacterial strain exhibited ~60 folds increase in
enzyme activity as compared to un-optimized culture medium. Further studies are
being suggested to scale up cellulase production in A. aneurinilyticus strain
BKT-9 so that it can be utilized for biomass saccharification at an industrial
level.
