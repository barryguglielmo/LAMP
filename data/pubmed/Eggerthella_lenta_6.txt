Higher probability of the development of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative
colitis (UC) as a possible consequence of the north-south gradient has been
recently suggested. Living far north or south of the equator is manifested in
fluctuation of vitamin D (vitD) levels depending on the season in both healthy
and affected individuals. In the present study we investigate the possible link
between the seasonal serum vitD level to the microbial composition of the lower
gut of Inflammatory Bowel disease (IBD) patients using 16S rRNA sequencing.
Decrease of serum vitD level in winter/spring season in a cohort of 35 UC
patients and 39 CD patients was confirmed. Low gut microbiota composition of
patients with IBD correlated with the serum level of 25(OH)D that directly
coupled to seasonal variability of the sunshine in the central European
countries. It is supposed to be related to increased abundance of Actinobacteria 
and Proteobacteria in UC and Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria, Firmicutes and
Bacteroidetes in CD. In summer/autumn period, we observed a reduction in
abundance of bacterial genera typical for inflammation like Eggerthella lenta,
Fusobacterium spp., Bacteroides spp., Collinsella aerofaciens, Helicobacter spp.,
Rhodococcus spp., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii; and increased abundance of
Pediococcus spp. and Clostridium spp. and of Escherichia/Shigella spp.
