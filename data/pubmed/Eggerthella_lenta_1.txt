We report a case of Eggerthella lenta bacteraemia. An elderly lady with
metastasised endometrial adenocarcinoma presented with complaints of fever nausea
vomiting and abdominal pain. CT scan of the abdomen showed enlarged liver with
multiple metastatic lesions raising suspicion of small-bowel obstruction. Due to 
multiple comorbid conditions, surgery was contraindicated and she was treated
empirically with meropenem and vancomycin. Blood culture received on admission
grew Eggerthela lenta.
