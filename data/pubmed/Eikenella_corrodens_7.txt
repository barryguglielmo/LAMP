BACKGROUND: Eikenella corrodens and Streptococcus anginosus, which are primary
colonization bacteria of the normal flora of the oropharynx, are infrequent
bacteria, especially the former. Here, we report a case of lung abscess with a
coinfection of Eikenella corrodens and Streptococcus anginosus in a lung cancer
patient.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 66-year-old Chinese man with lung cancer was admitted to the
hospital, complaining of a cough and expectoration for five months and fever for 
two months. After a series of inspections to differentiate a cancer-related fever
from an infectious fever, he was diagnosed with lung abscess. Draining pus
culture demonstrated Eikenella corrodens and Streptococcus anginosus. After more 
than 1â€‰month of antibiotic therapy and draining in total, he gradually recovered 
to fight against lung cancer.
CONCLUSION: This report highlights the increased pathogenicity of Eikenella
corrodens and Streptococcus anginosus in an immunocompromised cancer patient,
especially after a few invasive operations. Additionally, even though a patient
has been diagnosed with cancerous fever, strong vigilance is needed in case an
infection arises.
