Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MABC) is a taxonomic group of rapidly growing,
nontuberculous mycobacteria that are found as etiologic agents of various types
of infections. They are considered as emerging human pathogens. MABC consists of 
3 subspecies-M. abscessus subsp. bolletti, M. abscessus subsp. massiliense and M.
abscessus subsp. abscessus. Here we present a novel method for subspecies
differentiation of M. abscessus named Subspecies-Specific Sequence Detection
(SSSD). This method is based on the presence of signature sequences present
within the genomes of each subspecies of MABC. We tested this method against a
virtual database of 1505 genome sequences of MABC. Further, we detected signature
sequences of MABC in 45 microbiological samples through DNA hybridization. SSSD
showed high levels of sensitivity and specificity for differentiation of
subspecies of MABC, comparable to those obtained by rpoB sequence typing.
