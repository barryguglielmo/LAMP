INTRODUCTION: Respiratory diseases account for the highest number of clinical
problems in horses compared with other body systems. While microbiological
culture and sensitivity testing is essential for certain cases, knowledge of the 
most likely bacterial agents and their susceptibilities is necessary to inform
empirical antibiotic choices.
METHODS: A retrospective study of microbiological and cytological results from
upper and lower respiratory samples (n=615) processed in a commercial laboratory 
between 2002 and 2012 was carried out. A further study of lower respiratory
samples from horses with clinical signs of lower respiratory disease from May to 
June 2012 was undertaken.
RESULTS: Both studies revealed Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pasteurella species, Escherichia coli and Bordetella
bronchiseptica as the most frequently isolated species. S equi subspecies
zooepidemicus and subspecies equi were susceptible to ceftiofur (100 per cent)
and erythromycin (99 per cent). Resistance to penicillin (12.5 per cent of S equi
subspecies equi from upper respiratory tract samples) and tetracycline (62.7 per 
cent) was also detected. Gram-negative isolates showed resistance to gentamicin, 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline but susceptibility to enrofloxacin
(except Pseudomonas species, where 46.2 per cent were resistant). Multiple drug
resistance was detected in 1 per cent of isolates.
CONCLUSION: Resistance to first-choice antibiotics in common equine respiratory
tract bacteria was noted and warrants continued monitoring of their
susceptibility profiles. This can provide information to clinicians about the
best empirical antimicrobial choices against certain pathogenic bacteria and help
guide antibiotic stewardship efforts to converse their efficacy.
