We compared pneumococcal isolation rates and evaluated the benefit of using
oropharyngeal (OP) specimens in addition to nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens
collected from adults in rural Kenya. Of 846 adults, 52.1% were colonized;
pneumococci were detected from both NP and OP specimens in 23.5%, NP only in
22.9%, and OP only in 5.7%. Ten-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine strains
were detected from both NP and OP in 3.4%, NP only in 4.1%, and OP only in 0.7%. 
Inclusion of OP swabs increased carriage detection by 5.7%; however, the added
cost of collecting and processing OP specimens may justify exclusion from future 
carriage studies among adults.
