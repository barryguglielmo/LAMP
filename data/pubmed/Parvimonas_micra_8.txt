BACKGROUND: Gram-positive anaerobic (GPA) bacteria inhabit different parts of the
human body as commensals but can also cause bacteremia. In this retrospective
observational study, we analyzed GPA bacteremia pathogens before (2013-2015) and 
after (2016-2018) the introduction of the matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS).
METHOD: We conducted a retrospective observational study by searching the
microbiology database to identify all positive GPA blood cultures of patients
with GPA bacteremia diagnosed using the new technique, MALDI-TOF MS, between
January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2018; and using a conventional phenotypic method
between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2015 at a single tertiary center in
Japan. Parvimonas micra (P. micra) (17.5%) was the second most frequently
identified GPA (MALDI-TOF MS); we then retrospectively reviewed electronic
medical records for 25 P. micra bacteremia cases at our hospital. We also
conducted a literature review of published cases in PubMed from January 1, 1980, 
until December 31, 2019; 27 cases were retrieved.
RESULTS: Most cases of P. micra bacteremia were identified after 2015, both, at
our institute and from the literature review. They were of mostly elderly
patients and had comorbid conditions (malignancies and diabetes). In our cases,
laryngeal pharynx (7/25, 28%) and gastrointestinal tract (GIT; 6/25, 24%) were
identified as the most likely sources of bacteremia; however, the infection
source was not identified in 9 cases (36%). P. micra bacteremia were frequently
associated with spondylodiscitis (29.6%), oropharyngeal infection (25.9%),
intra-abdominal abscess (14.8%), infective endocarditis (11.1%), septic pulmonary
emboli (11.1%), and GIT infection (11.1%) in the literature review. Almost all
cases were treated successfully with antibiotics and by abscess drainage. The
30-day mortalities were 4 and 3.7% for our cases and the literature cases,
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Infection sites of P. micra are predominantly associated with GIT,
oropharyngeal, vertebral spine, intra-abdominal region, pulmonary, and heart
valves. Patients with P. micra bacteremia could have good prognosis following
appropriate treatment.
