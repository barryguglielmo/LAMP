The rearing of less established fish species in recirculating aquaculture systems
(RASs) is increasing, but may require adaptations of the rearing facilities if
health impairments occur. We observed several health issues in burbot Lota lota
reared for up to 2 yr in a RAS and used microbiological, histological and
molecular-biological methods to identify the causative agents. Minor skin trauma 
led to the development of ulcers. In addition, several fillets of burbot showed
pronounced granulomatous inflammation and calcification with signs of muscle
fiber degeneration which resembled a condition called 'sandy flesh disease' in
North American walleye. Several infectious agents were able to be excluded as a
cause for the disease. Carnobacterium maltaromaticum was isolated in high numbers
in some of the affected muscle tissue. However, the role of this bacterium or
other causative agents or husbandry conditions remains to be elucidated.
