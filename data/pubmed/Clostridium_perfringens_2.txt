Two new oligostilbenes, caragasinins D (1) and E (2), along with four known
compounds, kobophenol A (3), α-viniferin (4), wistin (5), and
5-hydroxy-2-[2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetyl]-3-methoxylbenzoic acid (6) were isolated 
from Caragana sinica roots. These compounds were spectroscopically analyzed for
their structure and stereochemistry and compared with existing data. The
configurations of 1 and 2 were elucidated by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and time-dependent
density-functional theory simulated electronic circular dichroism spectral data. 
All six compounds were evaluated for their inhibitory activity against
neuraminidase (NA) from Clostridium perfringens. Among the tested compounds,
5-hydroxy-2-[2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetyl]-3-methoxylbenzoic acid (6) demonstrated
statistically significant NA inhibitory activity, which was comparable to the
positive control, mangiferin.
