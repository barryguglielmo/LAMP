Diagnosis and treatment of culture negative endocarditis remains a challenge.
This report describes a rare cause of endocarditis in humans, Bartonella
vinsonii, identified through next generation sequencing of plasma microbial
cell-free DNA with confirmation of cardiac valve tissue infection through
immunohistochemical staining and polymerase chain reaction.
