Bacteria colonizing the mouth induce an adaptive immune response with the
systemic and local presence of species or strain-specific immunoglobulins. Few
studies have addressed global antibody patterns for oral bacteria or potential
population time trends. We assessed these aspects in relation to a panel of oral 
bacteria. Using multiplex immunoblotting, IgG levels for 26 oral bacterial
species (54 strains) were determined in 888 plasma samples from 30-year-old early
pregnant women (n = 516) and 50-year-old men and women (n = 372) collected
between 1976 and 2018. Inter-species correlations were found and age-dependent
profiles and levels of immune responses to oral bacteria confirmed. We found
temporal trends in the global and single-species antibody responses, but this was
age-specific with both inclining and declining shifts. Prominent shifts in the
younger group increased IgG towards health-associated Streptococcus salivarius
and Streptococcus sanguinis, and in the older group towards disease-associated
Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Filifactor alocis, and Streptococcus
mutans, among others. We concluded that temporal shifts occurred from 1976 to
2018, which may reflect improved oral health (more remaining teeth) and altered
lifestyle habits, but this needs to be evaluated in observational studies
considering more aspects.
