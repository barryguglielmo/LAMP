Cutaneous tuberculosis (TB) is an uncommon form of extrapulmonary TB that can be 
difficult to diagnose. The following case is about a 14-year-old female who was
experiencing delayed wound healing after an incision and drainage of a chest wall
abscess. A computed tomography scan of her chest obtained 2 months after the
procedure revealed pulmonary findings consistent with TB. An acid-fast bacilli
culture was obtained from the wound after the computed tomography scan was
performed and was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis 8 weeks later. Although
TB is relatively uncommon in the United States, it is more prevalent in the
Republic of Korea where the patient lives and was evaluated. This case serves to 
illustrate the long history of challenges the military medical community has
faced with TB and to remind providers to be cognizant about local common diseases
when serving overseas and include these diagnoses in their differentials.
