Parabacteroides massiliensis sp. nov., strain Marseille-P2231T (= CSURP2231 = DSM
101860) is a new species within the family Tannerellaceae. It was isolated from a
stool specimen of a 25-year-old healthy woman. Its genome was 5 013 798 bp long
with a 45.7 mol% G+C content. The closest species based on 16S rRNA sequence was 
Parabacteroides merdae strain JCM 9497T with 98.19% sequence similarity.
Considering phenotypic features and comparative genome studies, we proposed the
strain Marseille-P2231T as the type strain of Parabacteroides massiliensis sp.
nov., a new species within the genus Parabacteroides.
