Reptiles appear to be an important vector for Gram-negative pathogens, therefore,
they are epidemiologically relevant. However, the composition of reptilian
microbiota has been poorly recognized so far. The majority of studies concern
exotic reptiles as asymptomatic carriers of Salmonella serovars. Studies of other
intestinal bacteria of reptiles are rare. Only recently, the microbiota of
free-living European reptiles have been investigated, however, on the basis of
small samples, mainly in protected areas. Here, we aim to investigate cloacal
Gram-negative microbiota of free-living Natrix natrix. Snakes (N = 45) used in
the study were collected in Kraków (Poland) and its vicinity. Nineteen species of
Gram-negative bacteria were isolated. The most common species were: Aeromonas
hydrophila, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella spp. The bacteria
prevalent in N. natrix cloacal swabs are likely to represent the natural
intestinal Gram-negative microbiota of the examined snakes. Importantly, the
identified bacteria are pathogenic to humans, which clearly highlights the
epidemiological potential of free-living N. natrix. The risk of infection is high
for immunocompromised humans, children (under 5 years old), elderly persons, and 
pregnant women. Our study provides the largest dataset on intestinal
Gram-negative microbiota of wild snakes. The presence of multiple human pathogens
determined by us calls for the necessity of further studies on
reptile-transmitted bacteria in anthropogenic environments.
