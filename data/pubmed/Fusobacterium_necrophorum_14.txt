Lemierre's syndrome is a rare but life-threatening condition characterized by an 
oropharyngeal infection typically secondary to Fusobacterium necrophorum
resulting in septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein. Streptococcus 
intermedius is a particularly rare cause of Lemierre's syndrome with only a few
cases reported in the literature. Here we describe a rare case of Lemierre's
syndrome, caused by Streptococcus intermedius, likely secondary to an odontogenic
infection, found to have a cervical epidural abscess with concomitant large
retropharyngeal and prevertebral abscesses on presentation, in whom the clinical 
course was further complicated by an extensive cerebral venous sinus
thrombosis. However, despite grave complications, early diagnosis and appropriate
emergency management including intravenous antibiotics and surgical
intervention led to a successful recovery, thus demonstrating that aggressive
measures can potentially lead to a favorable outcome.
