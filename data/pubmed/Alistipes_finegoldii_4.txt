Enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) catalyzes a rate-controlling step in 
bacterial fatty-acid synthesis and is a target for antibacterial drug
development. A phylogenetic analysis shows that FabIs fall into four divergent
clades. Members of clades 1-3 have been structurally and biochemically
characterized, but the fourth clade, found in members of phylum Bacteroidetes, is
uncharacterized. Here, we identified the unique structure and conformational
changes that distinguish clade 4 FabIs. Alistipes finegoldii is a prototypical
Bacteroidetes inhabitant of the gut microbiome. We found that A. finegoldii FabI 
(AfFabI) displays cooperative kinetics and uses NADH as a cofactor, and its
crystal structure at 1.72 Å resolution showed that it adopts a Rossmann fold as
do other characterized FabIs. It also disclosed a carboxyl-terminal extension
that forms a helix-helix interaction that links the protomers as a unique feature
of AfFabI. An AfFabI·NADH crystal structure at 1.86 Å resolution revealed that
this feature undergoes a large conformational change to participate in covering
the NADH-binding pocket and establishing the water channels that connect the
active site to the central water well. Progressive deletion of these interactions
led to catalytically compromised proteins that fail to bind NADH. This unique
conformational change imparted a distinct shape to the AfFabI active site that
renders it refractory to a FabI drug that targets clade 1 and 3 pathogens. We
conclude that the clade 4 FabI, found in the Bacteroidetes inhabitants of the
gut, have several structural features and conformational transitions that
distinguish them from other bacterial FabIs.
