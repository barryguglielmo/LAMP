Alcaligenes faecalis is a gram-negative bacterium that is commonly found in the
environment. This pathogen is usually transmitted in the form of droplets through
ventilation equipment and nebulizers, but transmission through direct contact has
also been documented in few case reports. This pathogen can cause rare but fatal 
infections including appendicitis, abscesses, meningitis, bloodstream infection, 
endocarditis, and post-operative endophthalmitis. Pan drug resistance to all
commercially available antibiotics has been emerging globally. We present the
case of a 66-year-old male who had respiratory failure along with multiple
comorbidities. A large cavitary lesion caused by pan drug-resistant Alcaligenes
faecalis was found on chest imaging. Despite the treatment with broad-spectrum
antibiotics, the clinical outcome was very poor.
