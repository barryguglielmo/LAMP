Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) will cause various pneumococcal diseases when host
has a weak immune system. The World Health Organization ranks it as one of the 12
key pathogens causing heavy burden of disease. At present, the drug resistance of
Spn is rising, and vaccination is an important and effective strategy to decrease
the burden of disease. The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) 
is a preventive vaccine for adults that covers 65% to 91% of Spn isolates
worldwide. Accumulating evidence have confirmed the effectiveness of PPV23 in
decreasing the incidence, hospitalization, mortality, and economic burden of
pneumococcal diseases in adults. The burden of pneumococcal diseases in China is 
heavy, but the adult vaccination rate is low. Here, we review the prevalence of
adult pneumococcal diseases, the preventive and protective effects and benefits
of PPV23 vaccine on high-risk population, especially the elderly individuals. We 
hope this review can provide references and new ideas for adult PPV23 vaccination
programs in China.

肺炎链球菌在机体抵抗力下降时会引起各种肺炎球菌性疾病，WHO将其列为12种造成严重疾病负担的重点致病菌之一。当前肺炎链球菌的耐药性呈上升趋势，接种疫苗成为减轻疾病
负担的重要有效措施。23价肺炎球菌多糖疫苗（PPV23）是一种主要针对成人的预防性疫苗，覆盖了全球成人病例中65%~91%的分离株。国内外研究已经证实了PPV23
在降低成人肺炎球菌性疾病的发病率、住院率、死亡率以及经济负担方面的有效性。虽然我国肺炎球菌性疾病的疾病负担重，但成人接种率却很低。为此，本文总结了成人肺炎球菌性疾
病的国内外流行情况以及接种PPV23疫苗对高危人群尤其是老年人的预防保护效果和获益情况，为国内开展成人接种计划提供参考和新的思路。.
