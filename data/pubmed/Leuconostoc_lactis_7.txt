As a traditional fermented cereal, Inner Mongolian acidic gruel has a unique
flavor and rich nutrition, but the microbial diversity of acidic gruel and the
microbial differences among the products in different regions have not been
reported. The bacterial diversity and the lactic acid bacteria species of 27
types of traditional handmade acidic gruel were evaluated using a combination of 
MiSeq high-throughput sequencing and PCR-DGGE. All 358,205 high-quality 16S rRNA 
reads were divided into 25,171 OTUs under the similarity of 97%. Firmicutes,
Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were the dominant bacterial phyla, and the core
dominant genera were Lactobacillus and Acetobacter with average relative
abundances of 64.06% and 24.13%, respectively. The primary genera that caused the
differences in the bacterial community structure between the Bayan Nur and Ordos 
acidic gruel samples were Pseudomonas, Leuconostoc, and Acinetobacter as revealed
by redundancy analysis (RDA). PCR-DGGE analyses revealed that the lactic acid
bacteria in both the Bayan Nur and Ordos samples of acidic gruel were
Lactobacillus (L.) amylolyticus, L. alimentarius, L. fermentum, L. hamsteri, L.
helveticus, L. panis, L. plantarum, L. pontis, and Leuconostoc lactis. In
addition, L. hamsteri was the core strain detected among all the samples. The
results deepened the understanding of the microbial community composition and the
diversity of acidic gruel to provide a theoretical basis for the preservation and
protection of microbial resources in acidic gruel in the Inner Mongolia area.
