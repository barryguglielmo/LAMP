BACKGROUND: AsCas12a and LbCas12a nucleases are reported to be promising tools
for genome engineering with protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) TTTV as the optimal.
However, the C-containing PAM (CTTV, TCTV, TTCV, etc.) recognition by Cas12a
might induce extra off-target edits at these non-canonical PAM sites.
RESULTS: Here, we identify a novel Cas12a nuclease CeCas12a from Coprococcus
eutactus, which is a programmable nuclease with genome-editing efficiencies
comparable to AsCas12a and LbCas12a in human cells. Moreover, CeCas12a is
revealed to be more stringent for PAM recognition in vitro and in vivo followed
by very low off-target editing rates in cells. Notably, CeCas12a renders less
off-target edits located at C-containing PAM at multiple sites compared to
LbCas12a and AsCas12a, as assessed by targeted sequencing methods.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that CeCas12a nuclease is active in human cells and 
the stringency of PAM recognition could be an important factor shaping off-target
editing in gene editing. Thus, CeCas12a provides a promising candidate with
distinctive characteristics for research and therapeutic applications.
