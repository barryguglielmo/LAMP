MALP-2, a synthetic lipopeptide is a Toll-like receptor 2 and -6 ligand and
agonist. MALP-2 stimulates immune cells at different sites. Local stimulation in 
the lungs has beneficial effects in experimental pneumococci infection. The
presented study investigated local effects of MALP-2 in the mycobacterial
infection of lungs. MALP-2 was applied prior, simultaneously or after the
pulmonary infection with Mycobacterium bovis BCG. Colony forming units were
determined in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung homogenate. Numbers of
Mycobacterium bovis BCG colony forming units were found to be reduced in two
compartments, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung homogenate after treatment
with MALP-2 simultaneously to the infection for up to eight weeks. Reduction of
the bacterial load in both compartments was also found up to two weeks after
local treatment before and after the infection. Thus, macrophage activating
lipopeptide-2 enhances the host defence in the lung in acute and long term
bacterial infections.
