The Gram-positive anaerobic commensal Finegoldia magna colonizes the skin and
other non-sterile body surfaces, and is an important opportunistic pathogen. Here
we analyzed the effect of F. magna on human primary neutrophils. F. magna strains
ALB8 (expressing protein FAF), 312 (expressing protein L) and 505 (naturally
lacking both protein FAF and L) as well as their associated proteins activate
neutrophils to release reactive oxygen species, an indication for neutrophil
oxidative burst. Co-incubation of neutrophils with the bacteria leads to a strong
increase of CD66b surface expression, another indicator for neutrophil
activation. Furthermore, all tested stimuli triggered the release of NETs from
the activated neutrophils, pointing to a host defense mechanism in response to
the tested stimuli. This phenotype is dependent on actin rearrangement, NADPH
oxidases and the ERK1/2 pathway. Proteins FAF and L also induced the secretion of
several pro-inflammatory neutrophil proteins; HBP, IL-8 and INFγ. This study
shows for the first time a direct interaction of F. magna with human neutrophils 
and suggests that the activation of neutrophils plays a role in F. magna
pathogenesis.
