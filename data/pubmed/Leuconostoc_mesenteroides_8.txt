Leuconostoc mesenteroides DRP105 isolated from Chinese sauerkraut juice is an
intensive producer of dextran. We report the complete genome sequence of Leu.
mesenteroides DRP105. This strain contains a dextransucrase gene (dsr) involved
in the production of dextran, possibly composed of glucose monomers. To explore
the dextran synthesis mechanism of Leu. mesenteroides DRP105, we constructed a
dsr-deficient strain derived from Leu. mesenteroides DRP105 using the Cre-loxP
recombination system. The secondary structure prediction results showed that Leu.
mesenteroides DRP105 dextransucrase (Dsr) was coded by dsr and contained 17.07%
α-helices, 29.55% β-sheets, 10.18% β-turns, and 43.20% random coils. We also
analyzed the dextran yield, monosaccharide change, organic acid, and amino-acid
content of Leu. mesenteroides DRP105 and Leu. mesenteroides DRP105-Δdsr. The
result showed that the lack of dsr changed the Leu. mesenteroides DRP105 sugar
metabolism pathway, which in turn affected the production of metabolites.
