Two bacterial species with the ability to produce biosurfactants were isolated
from a pesticide contaminated soil and identified as Planococcus rifietoensis
IITR53 and Planococcus halotolerans IITR55. Formation of froth indicating the
surfactant production was observed when grown in basal salt medium containing 2% 
glucose. The culture supernatant after 72 h showed reduction in surface tension
from 72 N/m to 46 and 42 N/m for strain IITR53 and IITR55 with emulsification
index of 51 and 54% respectively. The biosurfactant identified as rhamnolipid
based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, was found to inhibit
the growth of both gram- positive and negative pathogenic bacteria. Both the
rhamnolipids at 40 mg/mL exhibited the release of extracellular DNA and protein
content. Also at one third of the MIC, a significant generation of reactive
oxygen species was recorded. These rhamnolipids effectively emulsified different 
vegetable oils suggesting their possible utilization as antimicrobial agent.
