Marine pollution is a significant issue in recent decades, with the increase in
industries and their waste harming the environment and ecosystems. Notably, the
rise in shellfish industries contributes to tons of shellfish waste composed of
up to 58% chitin. Chitin, the second most ample polymer next to cellulose, is
insoluble and resistant to degradation. It requires chemical-based treatment or
enzymatic hydrolysis to cleave the chitin polymers. The chemical-based treatment 
can lead to environmental pollution, so to solve this problem, enzymatic
hydrolysis is the best option. Moreover, the resulting biopolymer by-products can
be used to boost the fish immune system and also as drug delivery agents. Many
marine microbial strains have chitinase producing ability. Nevertheless, we still
lack an economical and highly stable chitinase enzyme for use in the industrial
sector. So we isolate a novel marine bacterial strain Achromobacter xylosoxidans 
from the shrimp waste disposal site using chitin minimal medium. Placket-Burman
and central composite design statistical models for culture condition
optimisation predicted a 464.2 U/ml of chitinase production. The culture
conditions were optimised for maximum chitinase production recording up to
467 U/ml. This chitinase from the A. xylosoxidans was 100% active at an optimum
temperature of 45 °C (withstand up to 55 °C) and pH 8 with 80% stability. The
HPLC analysis of chitinase degraded shellfish waste reveals a major amino acid
profile composition-arginine, lysine, aspartic acid, alanine, threonine and low
levels of isoleucine and methionine. These chitinase degraded products and
by-products can be used as supplements in the aquaculture industry.
