Bacterial infections are the most important problem of health care worldwide. The
hemolymph antibacterial proteins of Mesocyclops leuckarti was isolated for the
first time and its antibacterial efficacy was evaluated against four different
human pathogenic microbes viz., Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus,
Klebsiella pneumonia and Shigella flexneri. The antibacterial potential of the
antimicrobial proteins of hemolymph samples from plankton cultured in water
enriched with Cow Urine Distillate (CUD) was compared with normal ones. The
results indicated that the hemolymph proteins were more potential against Gram
negative bacteria than Gram positive bacteria. Klebsiella pneumonia was more
susceptible to the hemolymph proteins exhibiting a zone of inhibition measuring
27 mm. The supplement of CUD to the culture media further enriched the
antibacterial activity of the hemolymph proteins (29 mm). The SDS-PAGE analysis
indicated two different types of clear bands representing proteins of 53 kDa and 
19 kDa. Overall, this investigation signified that the microcrustaceans have a
defence mechanism hemolymph of Mesocyclops leuckarti have a potential agent for
novel antibiotics.
