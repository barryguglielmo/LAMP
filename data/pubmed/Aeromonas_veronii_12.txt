BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota is a complex ecosystem, which is essential for the
metabolism, health and immunity of host. Many diseases have been shown to be
closely related to the alteration of intestinal flora. Aeromonas veronii as a
conditioned pathogen can cause disease in Yangtze finless porpoise through
intestinal infections. However, it is not clear whether the disease caused by
Aeromonas veronii is related to changes of intestinal flora. In the current
study, the diversity and composition of gut microbiota in the healthy and
Aeromonas veronii-infected Yangtze finless porpoise were evaluated by
high-throughput sequencing to further investigate the potential association
between intestinal flora alteration and pathogen invasion.
RESULTS: A total of 127,3276 high-quality sequences were achieved and 2465
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were in common among all samples. The results 
of alpha diversity showed that there was no obvious difference in richness and
diversity between healthy and Aeromonas veronii-infected Yangtze finless
porpoise. Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria were the most dominant
phyla in all samples. In addition, the healthy Yangtze finless porpoise exhibited
higher abundance of Firmicutes and Fusobacteria than Aeromonas veronii-infected
Yangtze finless porpoise, while, the level of Proteobacteria was decreased. At
the genus level, Paeniclostridium and Paraclostridium were the predominant
bacteria genera in the CK (healthy Yangtze finless porpoise) group. In the DIS
(Aeromonas veronii-infected Yangtze finless porpoise) group, Lactobacillus and
unidentified_Enterobacteriaceae were the dominant bacteria genera and the
proportion of Paeniclostridium, Paraclostridium, Terrisporobacter, Cetobacterium,
Candidatus Arthromitus, Terrabacter and Dechloromonas were reduced.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our results showed that Aeromonas veronii infection
can alter the gut microbiota of the Yangtze finless porpoise by affecting the
number of harmful bacteria and beneficial bacteria.
