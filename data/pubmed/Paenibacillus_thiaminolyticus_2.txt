We have isolated a likely bacterial pathogen from cerebrospinal fluid from a
Ugandan infant suffering from hydrocephalus. Whole-genome sequencing and assembly
of the genome of the clinical isolate, as well as that of a previously deposited 
reference strain, identified the isolate as Paenibacillus thiaminolyticus, which 
has not been associated with widespread human infections.
