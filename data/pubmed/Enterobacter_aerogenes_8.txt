OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial resistance is a major threat to public health. New
drugs such as Ceftazidime/avibactam have been developed for the treatment of
Multi-Drug resistant (MDR) pathogens. Susceptibility can be variable and
inappropriate use can add a financial strain on the National Health Service
(NHS). There is a pressing need to ensure these new and invaluable antimicrobials
are preserved and used effectively.
METHODS: We undertook a retrospective observational study to assess the use of
Ceftazidime/avibactam and evaluated prescribing against applied standards.
RESULTS: Between August 2017 and January 2019, 28 patients received 31 courses of
Ceftazidime/avibactam. Prescribing according to the approved indications was
observed for 68% of prescriptions (p < 0.0001). Duration of therapy was often
prolonged but improved with Antimicrobial stewardship interventions. We observed 
56% susceptibility (15/27 isolates) of MDR organisms (Pseudomonas, Klebsiella,
Burkholderia, Enterobacter aerogenes, Achromobacter). We also report first in
vivo experience to treat pulmonary disease caused by Non-tuberculous mycobacteria
(NTM). Ceftazidime/avibactam was well tolerated, with no evidence of development 
of resistance at 6-months follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that Antimicrobial stewardship interventions led to
a more appropriate use of Ceftazidime/avibactam (as measured by duration of
therapy), preserving it as a treatment option for MDR infections.
