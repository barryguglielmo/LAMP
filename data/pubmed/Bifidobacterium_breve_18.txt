Dysbiosis is commonly detected in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),
supporting the concept that a dysregulated immune reaction to bacterial antigens 
has a pathogenic role in the development of intestinal inflammation. In the
present study, we have investigated the beneficial effects of a novel probiotic
formulation assembled by combining four probiotics (Streptococcus thermophilus,
Lactobacillus casei, Bifidobacterium breve) with Bacillus subtilis, a
Gram-positive bacterium, with extensive bio-applications. Mice rendered colitic
by administration of TNBS or DSS were administered with Bacillus subtilis alone, 
Vivomixx® or the novel Five strains formulation. Vivomixx® attenuated the
severity of inflammation and reduced the development of signs and symptoms of
colitis in both models. Adding Bacillus subtilis to Vivomixx® improved the
beneficial effects of the bacterial therapy. The novel Five strains formulation
was as effective as Vivomixx® in reducing the development of signs and symptoms
of colitis and reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators including
Il-6 and Tnf-α while increased the expression of Il-10 mRNA and the number of
Treg. In summary, we have shown that a novel Five strains probiotics formulation 
exerts beneficial effects on two chemical models of colitis, establishing
Bacillus subtilis as a probiotic in rodent models of inflammation.
