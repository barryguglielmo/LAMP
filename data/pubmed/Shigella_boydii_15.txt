This work discussed the preparation of Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) and AgNPs
impregnated sub-micrometer crystalline jute cellulose (SCJC) particles using a
green synthetic bioreduction method. The ultimate nanocomposite particles were
named as SCJC/Ag. The crystalline structure of AgNPs was maintained in SCJC/Ag
nanocomposte particles. The catalytic efficiency of SCJC/Ag nanocomposite
particles were evaluated for the degradation of congo red (CR) and methylene blue
(MB) using NaBH4 as reducing agent. A complete degradation of 20 mL of each CR
(0.1 mM) and MB (0.05 mM) dye solution was achieved within 14 min when
0.005 mg mL-1 of SCJC/Ag nanocomposite particles was employed. SCJC/Ag
nanocomposite particles also exhibited moderate antibacterial activities against 
Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Shigella dysenteriae and Shigella boydii
and the results were comparable with those of the reference AgNPs. SCJC/Ag
nanocomposite particles were the most effective against Escherichia coli (E.
coli) with minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.014 mg mL-1.
