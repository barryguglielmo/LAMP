The epidemiology of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) in Spain is largely
unknown because systematic reporting is not compulsory. The aim of our study was 
to describe the frequency and diversity of NTM species in our region and their
distribution according to the source sample, gender, and age of the patients. We 
performed a multicenter study of all NTM isolated in 24 public hospitals in
Madrid from 2013 to 2017. A total of 6.923 mycobacteria were isolated: 4535
(65.5%) NTM, and 2.388 (34.5%) Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTB). Overall,
61 different NTM species were identified. The most frequently isolated species
were Mycobacterium avium complex (47.7%), M. lentiflavum (12.2%), M. gordonae
(9.2%), M. fortuitum (8.9%), and M. abscessus (3.9%). Whereas MTB cases were
stable during the study period, the number of NTM isolates increased considerably
from 930 isolates in 2013 to 1012 in 2017; a sharp increase occurred in the last 
year. The rise in NTM isolates was mostly due to M. lentiflavum, M. kansasii, and
M. abscessus mainly isolated from respiratory specimens in patients older than
60. The increase in isolation rate of NTM in our region is consistent with the
increasing rates reported worldwide in the last decades. The rise in NTM isolates
was mainly attributed to M. lentiflavum but it also should be noted the
increasing of species with high pathogenic potential such as M. kansasii and M.
abscessus.
