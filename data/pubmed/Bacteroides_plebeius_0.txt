Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a promising strategy in the management 
of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The clinical effects of this practice are
still largely unknown and unpredictable. In this study, two children affected by 
mild and moderate ulcerative colitis (UC), were pre- and post-FMT monitored for
clinical conditions and gut bacterial ecology. Microbiota profiling relied on
receipts' time-point profiles, donors and control cohorts' baseline descriptions.
After FMT, the improvement of clinical conditions was recorded for both patients.
After 12 months, the mild UC patient was in clinical remission, while the
moderate UC patient, after 12 weeks, had a clinical worsening. Ecological
analyses highlighted an increase in microbiota richness and phylogenetic distance
after FMT. This increase was mainly due to Collinsella aerofaciens and
Eubacterium biforme, inherited by respective donors. Moreover, a decrease of
Proteus and Blautia producta, and the increment of Parabacteroides,
Mogibacteriaceae, Bacteroides eggerthi, Bacteroides plebeius, Ruminococcus
bromii, and BBacteroidesovatus were associated with remission of the patient's
condition. FMT results in a long-term response in mild UC, while in the moderate 
form there is probably need for multiple FMT administrations. FMT leads to a
decrease in potential pathogens and an increase in microorganisms correlated to
remission status.
