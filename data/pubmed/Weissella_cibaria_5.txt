BACKGROUND: Weissella cibaria CMU (oraCMU) has been commercially available in the
market for several years as oral care probiotics. The present study aimed to
evaluate the effects of oraCMU-containing tablets on periodontal health and oral 
microbiota.
METHODS: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 92
adults without periodontitis (20-39 years of age). All subjects received dental
scaling and root planing, and were randomly assigned to either probiotic or
placebo groups. The tablets were administered once daily for 8 weeks. Periodontal
clinical parameters included bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth (PD),
gingival index (GI), and plaque index (PI). In addition, microbiota in the
gingival sulcus were analysed.
RESULTS: BOP improved more in the probiotic group over 8 weeks. There were
statistically significant differences in BOP of the maxilla buccal and lingual
sites between the groups during the intervention (P < 0.05). No significant
inter-group differences in PD, GI, and PI were observed during the intervention. 
Oral bacteria were observed to be fewer in the probiotic group. There was a
significant change in levels of Fusobacterium nucleatum at four and 8 weeks
between the two groups. Besides, there were significant differences at 8 weeks in
levels of Staphylococcus aureus.
CONCLUSIONS: We reported an improvement in BOP and microbial environment and
demonstrated the antimicrobial activity of oraCMU against F. nucleatum. Thus, its
supplementation may contribute to overall oral health.
