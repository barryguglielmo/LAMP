Capnocytophaga is a group of facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacteria present
in the oral cavity of humans, dogs and cats, as part of their normal oral flora. 
Here, we described two cases of bloodstream infections (BSI) caused by
Capnocytophaga in neutropenic autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
(auto-HSCT) patients with mucositis (Grade I and Grade III) identified by
Maldi-Tof. They were successfully treated with β-lactam (meropenem and
piperacillin-tazobactam). The species C. sputigena was confirmed by 16S rRNA gene
sequencing in one patient. The review of literature showed that C. ochraceae was 
the most frequent species causing BSI in auto-HSCT patients and that the patients
usually presented mucositis and were neutropenic at the onset of the infection.
