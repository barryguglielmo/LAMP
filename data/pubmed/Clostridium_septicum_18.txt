CASE: Few cases have reported Clostridium species of bacteria as a source for
vertebral osteomyelitis and epidural abscesses. The subspecies of Clostridium
septicum has not been described as a cause. This case describes a 69-year-old man
who hematogenously spread C. septicum without associated malignancy, subsequently
failed conservative management in the form of intravenous antibiotics, and was
definitively treated with surgical intervention through a minimally invasive
approach.
CONCLUSIONS: An epidural abscess occurring in a surgically naive patient is a
rare phenomenon. An epidural abscess caused by C. septicum is even rarer.
Appropriate imaging, early recognition, and surgical debridement can lead to a
favorable outcome.
