Ectoine, the most prominent osmolyte in nature, is a vital compatible solute
present in halophilic bacterium. It protects the cellular biomolecules of the
halophilic bacteria and retains their intrinsic function from extreme
circumstances. In the current research, ectoine biosynthesis gene cluster
(ectABC) in Bacillus clausii NIOT-DSB04 was expressed heterologically in E. coli 
M15 (pREP4). RP-HPLC resolved several fractions of the purified recombinant
product, one of which had been confirmed as ectoine. The recombinant ectoine was 
further characterized by 1H and 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. The purified
recombinant ectoine was also authenticated by FT-IR studies with the existence of
ester carbonyl and C-H group. In IPTG induced E. coli M15 transgenic cells, the
enzymatic activity of the ectA, B and C genes were found to be higher than that
of uninduced cells.
