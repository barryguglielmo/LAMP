Slackia exigua is an obligate anaerobic coccobacillus associated with dental
infection, but rarely causes extraoral infection. We report two cases of
monomicrobial bacteremia caused by S. exigua isolated from two institutions. The 
first case involved community-acquired bacteremia associated with pleural empyema
in a 69-year-old man. The second case involved hospital-acquired bacteremia
secondary to postoperative intra-abdominal abscess in a 73-year-old man with
primary intestinal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. S. exigua was finally
identified by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing analyses in both cases. In the
first case, our attempts to identify the organism using commercial identification
kits for anaerobes resulted in inaccurate identification as Gemella morbillorum. 
However, S. exigua was promptly identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry in the second case. The epidemiology 
and clinical characteristics of S. exigua extraoral infection remain unclear
because of the limitations in accurate identification and because only 19 cases
of extraoral S. exigua infection have been reported previously, including four
cases of bacteremia. Physicians should focus on this species, which can cause
community-acquired infections and spread via various routes even in patients with
no comorbidities. Further studies are needed to clarify the clinical
characteristics of extraoral S. exigua infections.
