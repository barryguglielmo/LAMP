OBJECTIVES: To investigate the nationwide prevalence of mcr-1-positive Klebsiella
pneumoniae (MCRPKP) strains among healthy adults in China and identify their
phenotypic and genomic characterizations.
METHODS: A total of 7401 rectal swab samples were collected from healthy
individuals in 30 hospitals located in 30 provinces and municipalities of
mainland China in 2016. Colistin-resistant bacteria were enriched in
colistin-supplemented lysogeny broth. MCRPKP strains were isolated and
characterized with MALDI-TOF MS, PCR analysis and antimicrobial susceptibility
testing. The genomic characteristics of MCRPKP strains were determined by WGS and
bioinformatics analysis.
RESULTS: Seven MCRPKP strains and one mcr-1-positive Klebsiella variicola strain 
were selectively isolated from six locales (three from Henan and one from each of
Tianjin, Jiangxi, Yunnan, Gansu and Tibet). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing 
results indicated that all mcr-1-positive strains were susceptible to meropenem, 
aztreonam and ceftazidime/avibactam. WGS analysis suggested these strains
belonged to seven distinct STs: ST15, ST1425, ST1462, ST273, ST307, ST391 and
ST37-SLV. mcr-1 genes were carried by diverse plasmids, including IncHI2 (n = 3),
IncX4 (n = 2), IncHI2/IncN (n = 1), IncFIB (n = 1) and one other plasmid type.
Two ST15 strains harboured both mcr-1 and mcr-8 genes, which has not been
reported before.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicated a low prevalence of mcr-1-positive Klebsiella
strains (0.11%, 8/7401) in healthy individuals in mainland China and most of
these strains remained susceptible to clinically important antibiotics. The
prevalence and coexistence of mcr-1 and mcr-8 in K. pneumoniae may further
threaten public health through either the food chain or environmental routes.
