Klebsiella pneumoniae is declared as antibiotic resistant by WHO, with the
critical urgency of developing novel antimicrobial therapeutics as drug
resistance is the second most dangerous threat after terrorism. Besides many
attempts still, there is no effective vaccine available against K. pneumoniae. By
utilizing all the available proteomic data we prioritized the novel proteins
ideal for vaccine development using bioinformatics tools and techniques. Among
the huge data, eight proteins passed all the barriers and were considered ideal
candidates for vaccine development. These include: copper silver efflux system
outer membrane protein (CusC), outer membrane porin protein (OmpN), Fe++
enterobactin transporter substrate binding protein (fepB), zinc transporter
substrate binding protein (ZnuA), ribonuclease HI, tellurite resistant
methyltransferase (the B), and two uncharacterized hypothetical proteins
(WP_002918223 and WP_002892366). These proteins were also subjected to epitope
analysis and were found best for developing subunit vaccine against K.
pneumoniae. The study shows that the potential vaccine targets are sufficiently
efficient being virulent, of outer membranous origin and can be proposed for the 
DNA third-generation vaccines development that would help to cope up infections
caused by multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae.
