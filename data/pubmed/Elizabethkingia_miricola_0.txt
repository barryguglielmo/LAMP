This report describes an outbreak of Elizabethkingia miricola in northern leopard
frogs (Lithobates pipiens) and three other species of frogs and toads held in
captivity in Germany. The authors examine several treatment options and underline
the difficulties in treating larger numbers of individuals with antimicrobials
applied through bathing. Whole genome sequencing of three bacterial isolates
emphasizes their relatedness to other frog isolates and leads us to conclude that
E. miricola is an emerging and difficult to treat pathogen with a broad host
range across anuran species. Moreover, ambiguities in identification of
flavobacteria associated with disease in frogs reported in the literature make it
seem possible that E. miricola has been overlooked as an anuran pathogen in the
past.
