Clostridium tyrobutyricum cannot utilize galactose, which is abundant in
lignocellulose and red algae, as a carbon source for butyric acid production.
Hence, when using galactose-rich coffee ground hydrolysate as the substrate, the 
fermentation performance of C. tyrobutyricum is poor. In this work, a recombinant
strain, C. tyrobutyricum ATCC 25755/ketp, overexpressing galactose catabolism
genes (galK, galE, galT, and galP) from Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 was
constructed for the co-utilization of glucose and galactose. Batch fermentation
in the bioreactor showed that ATCC 25755/ketp could efficiently utilize galactose
without glucose-induced carbon catabolite repression and consume nearly 100% of
the galactose present in the spent coffee ground hydrolysate. Correspondingly,
the butyric acid concentration and productivity of ATCC 25755/ketp reached
34.3 g/L and 0.36 g/L·h, respectively, an increase of 78.6% and 56.5% compared
with the wild-type strain, indicating its potential for butyric acid production
from hydrolysates of inexpensive and galactose-rich biomass.
