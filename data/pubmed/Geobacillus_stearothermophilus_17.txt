The objective of this work was to determine the influence of washing and
sterilization under real hospital conditions on properties of microbial barrier
offered by polyurethane coated fabrics used in surgery and for wrapping sterile
items. Emphasis was put on the change of surface polyurethane coating by using
FTIR analysis. The permeability and durability of the microbial barrier were
determined after 0, 10, and 20 washing and sterilization procedures according to 
previously developed methods. Bacterial endospores of the apathogenic species of 
the genus Bacillus Geobacillus stearothermophilus and Bacillus atrophaeus were
used. Mechanical damage to medical textiles in the washing and sterilization
process was determined according to standard HRN EN ISO 13914-1:2008 and
associated with changes in physical and mechanical properties. Chemical changes
of PU coatings were determined using FTIR analysis. The results showed an
exceptionally efficient microbial barrier and its durability in all samples after
0, 10 and 20 washing and sterilization procedures and for a period of one, two
and three months.
