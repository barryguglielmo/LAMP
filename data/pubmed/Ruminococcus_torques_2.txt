OBJECTIVE: To study the characteristics of the intestinal flora in patients with 
diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and analyze the association between the
intestinal flora and clinical indicators.
METHODS: We classified 80 subjects into three groups: patients with DPN (n = 45),
patients type 2 diabetes without DPN (n = 21), and healthy controls (n = 14). The
intestinal flora composition was compared among the three groups, and the
correlation between the intestinal flora and clinical indicators was analyzed.
RESULTS: At the phylum level, the richness of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria was
elevated in the DN group, and that of Bacteroidetes was decreased. At the genus
level, the richness of Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium was significantly
decreased in the DPN group, whereas that of Escherichia-Shigella,
Lachnoclostridium, Blautia, Megasphaera, and Ruminococcus torques group was
increased. The homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance index was
positively correlated with Megasphaera richness. Glycine ursodeoxycholic acid was
positively correlated with Ruminococcus gnavus group and Phascolarctobacterium
richness. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid was positively correlated with Ruminococcus
gnavus group and Parabacteroides richness.
CONCLUSION: There was obvious intestinal microbiota disorder in patients with
DPN, which may be related to insulin resistance. These changes may have important
roles in the development of DPN.
