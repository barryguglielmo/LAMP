In order to better understand the spatial spread of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in 
Wales, an All Wales Badgers Found Dead (AWBFD) survey was carried out from
2014-2016. For Wales, as a whole, there was a significant decrease (p < 0.001) in
prevalence of bTB in badgers since a similar survey was carried out in 2005-2006,
with a drop from 13.3% to 7.3%. The highest prevalence was observed for the High 
TB Area East (18.6%), which shares its border with England, and differed
significantly (p < 0.001) from the High TB Area West (7.4%). The lowest
proportion of carcases diagnosed with the disease (0.7%) was in the Low TB Area, 
followed by the two Intermediate TB Areas of Wales (2.7%). The M. bovis isolates 
from badgers tended to be similar to the genotypes of cattle in the same area,
except in the Low TB Area. The direction of any cross species transmission and
the drivers for this cannot be determined from this study. The spatial variations
described here support the need for regionally adapted surveillance and control
measures for bovine tuberculosis in Wales.
