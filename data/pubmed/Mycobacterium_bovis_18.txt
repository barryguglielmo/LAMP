Tuberculosis (TB) is the global leading cause of death from an infectious agent
with approximately 10 million new cases of TB and 1.45 million deaths in 2018.
Bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) remains the only approved vaccine for Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (M. tb, causative agent of TB), however clinical studies have shown 
BCG has variable effectiveness ranging from 0-80% in adults. With 1.7 billion
people latently infected, it is becoming clear that vaccine regimens aimed at
both post-exposure and pre-exposure to M. tb will be crucial to end the TB
epidemic. The two main strategies to improve or replace BCG are subunit and live 
attenuated vaccines. However, following the failure of the MVA85A phase IIb trial
in 2013, more varied and innovative approaches are being developed. These include
recombinant BCG strains, genetically attenuated M. tb and naturally attenuated
mycobacteria strains, novel methods of immunogenic antigen discovery including
for hypervirulent M. tb strains, improved antigen recognition and delivery
strategies, and broader selection of viral vectors. This article reviews
preclinical vaccine work in the last 5 years with focus on those tested against
M. tb challenge in relevant animal models.
