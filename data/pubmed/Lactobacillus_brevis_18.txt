The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the algae Chlorella vulgaris 
on the growth, acidifying activity, proportion of lactic acid isomers, and
enzymatic profile of Lactobacillus brevis (ŁOCK 0944, ŁOCK 0980, ŁOCK 0992, and
MG451814) isolated from vegetable silages. The results indicated that adding
algae at concentrations of 0.1% (w/v) and 1.5% (w/v) to the Lactobacillus spp.
growth medium accelerated the growth of bacteria and thus shortened their phase
of logarithmic growth. The acidifying activity of the tested Lactobacillus brevis
increased with an increased concentration of algae. Lactobacillus spp. cultured
in the presence of Chlorella vulgaris showed higher production of l-lactic acid
and lower d-lactic acid production. Moreover, the addition of algae changed the
enzymatic activity of lactic acid bacteria; for instance, Lactobacillus brevis
ŁOCK 0980 demonstrated more enzymatic activity of valine arylamidase,
α-galactosidase, and α-glucosidase. Combining Lactobacillus brevis with the algae
Chlorella vulgaris allows for the creation of innovative, functional products
which confer favorable properties to the final product and open new horizons for 
the food industry.
