Background: Rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) comprise nearly half of the
validated species of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) and have been reported to 
have a higher incidence in Asia as compared to Europe and America. There is
limited information on RGM infections from South Asia. Hence, the present study
aimed to ascertain the incidence of pulmonary infections due to RGM in Delhi and 
to review the status of available information on the prevalence of RGM in South
Asia, a region endemic for tuberculosis.
Methods: We analyzed 933 mycobacterial isolates obtained from pulmonary samples
in Delhi and performed species identification by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR)-restriction analysis (restriction fragment length polymorphism) and line
probe assay. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) was performed by broth
microdilution method. We also reviewed reports available on pulmonary infections 
in South Asia, attributed to RGM.
Results: Of the 933 mycobacterial isolates studied, NTM were identified in 152
(16.3%). Of these, 65/152 (42.8%) were RGM comprising Mycobacterium fortuitum
(34/65; 52.3%), Mycobacterium abscessus (25/65; 38.5%), Mycobacterium chelonae
(3/65; 4.61%), Mycobacterium mucogenicum (2/65; 3.1%), and Mycobacterium
smegmatis (1/65; 1.5%). On applying the American Thoracic Society/Infectious
Diseases Society of America guidelines, 11/25 (44%) M. abscessus, 3/3 (100%) M.
chelonae, and both isolates of M. mucogenicum were found to be clinically
relevant. DST revealed that maximum susceptibility of the RGM was seen to
linezolid, clarithromycin, and amikacin.
Conclusions: Of the RGM isolated in the present study, 16/65 (24.6%) were found
to be clinically relevant. Hence, it is important to recognize these organisms as
potential pathogens to identify patients with RGM disease to initiate appropriate
therapy.
