Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global epidemic with an increasing prevalence
worldwide. Effective preventive strategies are urgently needed. This study aimed 
to investigate the effect of nutraceutical components, a fermented soybean
product (ImmuBalance, IMB) and an oligo-lactic acid product (LAP), on the
prevention of adenine-induced CKD in mice. Female C57BL/6 mice were randomly
assigned into following experimental groups: negative control; model control; and
models treated with IMB at 250 or 1000 mg/kg body weight (BW), LAP at 1000 or
2000 mg/kg BW, and IMB/LAP combinations. The CKD model was established by
intraperitoneal injection of adenine daily for 4 weeks, and treatments started 2 
weeks before adenine injection and ended after 10 weeks. Compared with the model 
control, the treatments did not significantly alter the body weight or food
intake. Both IMB and LAP, especially their combination, significantly inhibited
tubular dilation, tubulointerstitial degeneration or atrophy, interstitial
chronic inflammation and acute inflammation in the kidneys of CKD mice, and
significantly decreased serum cystatin C levels. IMB or LAP significantly
reversed CKD-associated increases of circulating and kidney levels of
inflammatory cytokines, circulating levels of kidney injury biomarkers, and
kidney levels of stem cell biomarkers, and significantly reversed CKD-associated 
reduction of cecum Clostridium leptum group. Our results suggest that dietary
supplementation of IMB or LAP may significantly delay the development and/or
progression of CKD.
