The present study aimed to identify and compare the microbial signatures between 
periodontally healthy and periodontitis subjects using 454 sequences of 16S rRNA 
genes. Subgingival plaque samples were collected from ten periodontally healthy
subjects and ten matched chronic periodontitis patients. Bacterial DNA was
extracted and next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA genes was performed. The
microbial composition differed between healthy subjects and periodontitis
patients at all phylogenetic levels. Particularly, 16 species, including
Lautropia mirabilis and Neisseria subflava predominated in healthy subjects,
whereas nine species, including Porphyromonas gingivalis and Filifactor alocis
predominated in periodontitis. UniFrac, a principal coordinate and network
analysis, confirmed distinct community profiles in healthy subjects and
periodontitis patients. Using predicted function profiling, pathways involved in 
phenylpropanoid, GPI-anchor biosynthesis, and metabolism of alanine, arginine,
aspartate, butanoate, cyanoamino acid, fatty acid, glutamate, methane, proline,
and vitamin B6 were significantly over-represented in periodontitis patients.
These results highlight the oral microbiota alterations in microbial composition 
in periodontitis and suggest the genes and metabolic pathways associated with
health and periodontitis. Our findings help to further elucidate microbial
composition and interactions in health and periodontitis.
