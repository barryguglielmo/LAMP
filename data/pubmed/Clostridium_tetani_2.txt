Tetanus is an acute, fatal disease caused by exotoxin produced by Clostridium
tetani. The current vaccine against tetanus is based on inactivated tetanus toxin
(TeNT). To develop a recombinant TeNT vaccine suitable for replacement of
full-length tetanus toxoid (TT) vaccine for use in humans, a recombinant
non-tagged isoform of the Hc domain of the tetanus toxin (THc) was expressed in
Escherichia coli and purified by sequential chromatography steps. The
immunogenicity and protective effect of the THc antigen were explored and
compared with those of TT in Balb/c mice. The THc-based subunit vaccine provided 
complete protection against TeNT challenge following a high dosage as a toxoid
vaccine. While the anti-THc and neutralising antibody titres were higher for the 
THc-based vaccine than the TT vaccine because protective epitopes are located on 
the THc domain. Frequency- and dose-dependent immunoprotection were also observed
in THc-immunised mice. Mice immunised with one injection of 1 μg or 4 μg THc
antigen were completely protected against 102 or 103 50% mouse lethal dose (LD50)
of TeNT, respectively. Furthermore, the THc protein was found to recognise and
bind to ganglioside GT1b in a dose-dependent manner, and anti-THc sera antibodies
also inhibited binding between THc and GT1b. Antigen on the form of recombinant
non-tagged THc domain expressed in E. coli achieved strong immunoprotective
potency, suggesting that it could be developed into a candidate subunit vaccine
against tetanus as an alternative to the current TT vaccine.
