Vulvovaginal candidosis (VVC) is a common condition with severe symptoms and high
recurrence rates. Probiotic lactobacilli are explored as alternatives to azole
treatments. Although the vaginal microbiota is generally not depleted in
lactobacilli during VVC, studies indicate that the functionality and
antimicrobial activity of the lactobacilli is impaired. We selected three strains
from the Lactobacillus genus complex (L. rhamnosus GG, L. pentosus KCA1 and L.
plantarum WCFS1) based on in vitro evaluation and formulated them in a gel for
vaginal application. This gel was evaluated in 20 patients suffering from acute
VVC, who were followed for four weeks including a 10-day treatment period. The
microbiome was assessed through 16S rRNA (bacteria) and internal transcribed
spacer (ITS; fungi) amplicon sequencing, supplemented with quantitative PCR,
culture and microscopy for Candida evaluation. 45% of women did not require
rescue medication (3×200 mg fluconazole), implying an improvement of their
symptoms. These women showed similar end concentrations of fungi as women treated
with fluconazole. Moreover, fluconazole appeared to reduce numbers of endogenous 
lactobacilli. Our study points towards important aspects for future selection of 
lactobacilli for probiotic use in VVC and the need to investigate possible
negative influences of azoles on the vaginal bacterial community.
