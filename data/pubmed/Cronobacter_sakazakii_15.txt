BACKGROUND: Neonatal infections with Cronobacter sakazakii have recently been
associated with the consumption of expressed human milk.
STUDY AIMS: (1) To evaluate whether human milk has antimicrobial capacity against
C. sakazakii and (2) to determine the stability of its capacity when it is
subjected to various treatments.
METHODS: The antimicrobial capacity of human milk against C. sakazakii was
evaluated using an observational, cross-sectional, comparative design. Mature
human milk samples (N = 29) were subjected to different treatments. After
incubation at 37°C for 72 hr, samples were compared with fresh milk on the
stability of their antimicrobial capacity. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
was performed.
RESULTS: In fresh milk, counts of C. sakazakii were reduced by 47.26% (SD = 6.74)
compared to controls. In treated milk, reductions were: refrigeration at 4°C for 
72 hr (M = 33.84, SD = 13.84), freezing at -20°C for 1, 2, and 3 months (M =
40.31, SD = 9.10; M = 35.96, SD = 9.39; M = 26.20, SD = 13.55, respectively),
Holder pasteurization (M = 23.56, SD = 15.61), and human milk bank treatment with
(M = 14.37, SD = 18.02) and without bovine fortifier (M = 3.70, SD = 23.83).
There were significant differences (p < .05) between fresh and treated milk.
CONCLUSIONS: Human milk has antimicrobial capacity against C. sakazakii. However,
its capacity is negatively influenced by common preservation and hygienization
methods. Milk should be stored refrigerated for a maximum of 72 hr or frozen for 
a short period of time.
