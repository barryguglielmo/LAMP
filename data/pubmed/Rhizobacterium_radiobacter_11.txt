RATIONALE: Rhizobium radiobacter is a Gram-negative pathogen present in soil and 
plants. Cases of R radiobacter infection in immunocompromised hosts have been
sporadically reported. However, septic shock caused by R radiobacter is rarely
seen.
PATIENT CONCERNS: Here, we describe an elderly patient with a rapid progression
of watery diarrhea, anorexia, fever, weakness, oliguria, and shock. Blood results
showed increased total white blood cell count and C-reactive protein. Arterial
blood gas results showed hypoxia and elevated lactate level. The Sequential Organ
Failure Assessment score was 11. Blood culture at admission showed Gram-negative 
bacteria, which were later confirmed as R radiobacter.
DIAGNOSIS: Septic shock caused by R Radiobacter.
INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with intravenous cefoperazone/sulbactam
and sequential oral levofloxacin.
OUTCOMES: The patient recovered completely.
CONCLUSION: R radiobacter may be considered as a potential opportunistic pathogen
that may cause severe sepsis in elderly patients, especially those with multiple 
underlying diseases.
