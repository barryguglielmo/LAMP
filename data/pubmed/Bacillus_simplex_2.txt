Heterodera glycines is one of the most destructive pathogens of soybean. Soybean 
seeds coated with Bacillus simplex Sneb545 have shown resistance to H. glycines
as a result of induced systemic resistance (ISR) in the plants. In this study, we
aimed to identify the resistance-inducing determinants from this B. simplex
strain. Combining the ISR bioassay, six ISR-active compounds were isolated from a
culture of B. simplex Sneb545 using organic solvent gradient extraction, silica
gel column chromatography, Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography, and
semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and all systems
were based on activity tracking. The compounds were determined as
cyclic(Pro-Tyr), cyclic(Val-Pro), cyclic(Leu-Pro), uracil, phenylalanine, and
tryptophan using 1H NMR and 13C NMR. In plants from seeds coated with Bacillus
simplex Sneb545, these six ISR-active compounds delayed the development of H.
glycines in soybean roots. Moreover, cyclic(Pro-Tyr), cyclic(Val-Pro), and
tryptophan reduced the number of nematodes in soybean roots. The expression
levels of defense-related genes with cyclic(Val-Pro), tryptophan and uracil
treatment soybean analysed using Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The
results indicate cyclic(Val-Pro), tryptophan and uracil induced the expression of
defense-related genes involved in the SA- and JA-pathways to against H. glycines.
Our research results provide new agents for the control of H. glycines.
