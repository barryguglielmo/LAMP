Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (S. maltophilia) is a Gram-negative,
multidrug-resistant organism that both opportunistically infects the bloodstream 
and leads to pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients, including those with
hematologic malignancies. In patients with severe respiratory failure, venovenous
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) can stabilize the respiratory
status. However, whether ECMO in patients with hematologic malignancies improves 
the clinical outcomes is still controversial because ECMO increases the risk of
the exacerbation of sepsis and bleeding. We report a case of a 46-year-old man
with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia hemorrhagic pneumonia acquired during
consolidation chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia in whom VV ECMO lead to a
good clinical outcome. The stabilization of his respiratory status achieved with 
VV ECMO allowed time for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole antibiotic therapy to
improve the pneumonia. We suggest the background of patients, including
comorbidities and general conditions, should be taken into account when
considering the clinical indications of ECMO.
