A mediator biosensor based on Paracoccus yeei bacteria for assaying the toxicity 
of perfumery and cosmetics samples was developed. An approach to selecting an
electron-transport mediator based on the heterogeneous electron transfer
constants for investigated mediators (ks) and the mediator-biomaterial
interaction constants (kinteract) was proposed. Screening of nine compounds as
potential mediators showed a ferrocene mediator immobilized in graphite paste to 
have the highest efficiency of electron transfer to the graphite-paste electrode 
(the heterogeneous transfer constant, 0.4 ± 0.1 cm/s) and a high constant of
interaction with P. yeei (0.023 ± 0.001 dm3/(g·s)). A biosensor for toxicity
assessment based on the ferrocene mediator and P. yeei bacteria was formed. The
biosensor was tested on samples of four heavy metals (Cu2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, Cd2+) and
two phenols (phenol and p-nitrophenol). Proceeding from the EC50 index, it was
found that the use of the ferrocene mediator made the biosensor more sensitive to
investigated toxicants than most analogues described. Toxicity determination of
four perfumery and cosmetics samples by the developed biosensor showed prospects 
of using this system for real-time toxicity monitoring of samples.
