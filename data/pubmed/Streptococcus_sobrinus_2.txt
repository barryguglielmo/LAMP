BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study is to assess the antiadherent and
antibacterial properties of surface-modified different orthodontic brackets with 
silver nanoparticles against Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus,
using radiomarker.
METHODS: In this study evaluated quantitatively the adherence of Streptococci to 
orthodontic brackets, 300 samples of orthodontic brackets were selected and
classified in to 10 groups as follow: GIn (InVu-Roth), GIIn
(System-AlexanderLTS), GIIIn (Gemini-Roth), GIVn (NuEdge-Roth), GVn (Radiance
plus-Roth), GVI (InVu-Roth), GVII (System-AlexanderLTS), GVIII (Gemini-Roth), GIX
(NuEdge-Roth), GX (Radiance plus-Roth). All the samples were sonicated and
Streptococci were cultivated by gender. A radioactive marker (3H) was used to
codify the bacteria and measure them. After that, the brackets were submerged in 
a radiolabelled solution, and the radiation was measured. The statistical
analysis was calculated with ANOVA test (Sheffè post hoc).
RESULTS: The results showed significant differences were found among the groups. 
GIIIn shown the lowest scores for both bacteria; in contrast, GIX for
Streptococcus mutans and GVI for Streptococcus sobrinus were the highest values.
CONCLUSIONS: Surface modification of orthodontic brackets with silver
nanoparticles can be used to prevent the accumulation of dental plaque and the
development of dental caries during orthodontic treatment.
