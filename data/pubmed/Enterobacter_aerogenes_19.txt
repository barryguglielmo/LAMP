The increase of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) and lack of
therapeutic options due to the scarcity of new antibiotics has sparked interest
toward the use of intravenous fosfomycin against systemic CRE infections. We
aimed to investigate the in vitro pharmacodynamics of fosfomycin against
carbapenem-resistant Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella aerogenes Time-kill
studies and population analysis profiles were performed with eight clinical CRE
isolates, which were exposed to fosfomycin concentrations ranging from 0.25 to
2,048 mg/liter. The 24-h mean killing effect was characterized by an inhibitory
sigmoid maximum effect (E max) model. Whole-genome sequencing was performed to
elucidate known fosfomycin resistance mechanisms. Fosfomycin MICs ranged from 0.5
to 64 mg/liter. The isolates harbored a variety of carbapenemase genes including 
bla IMP, bla KPC, and bla NDM Five out of eight isolates harbored the fosA gene, 
while none harbored the recently discovered fosL-like gene. Heteroresistant
subpopulations were detected in all isolates, with two out of eight isolates
harboring heteroresistant subpopulations at up to 2,048 mg/liter. In time-kill
studies, fosfomycin exhibited bactericidal activity at 2 to 4 h at several
fosfomycin concentrations (one isolate at ≥16 mg/liter, two at ≥32 mg/liter, two 
at ≥64 mg/liter, two at ≥128 mg/liter, and one at ≥512 mg/liter). At 24 h,
bactericidal activity was only observed in two isolates (MICs, 0.5 and
4 mg/liter) at 2,048 mg/liter. From the E max model, no significant bacterial
killing was observed beyond 500 mg/liter. Our findings suggest that the use of
fosfomycin monotherapy may be limited against CRE due to heteroresistance and
rapid bacterial regrowth. Further optimization of intravenous fosfomycin dosing
regimens is required to increase efficacy against such infections.
