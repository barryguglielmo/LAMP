OBJECTIVE: Microscopic colitis (MC) encompasses the two histopathological
distinct entities of collagenous colitis (CC) and lymphocytic colitis (LC). In
this Danish population-based cohort study, we examined the risk of MC following
stool culture with Campylobacter concisus, C. jejuni, non-typhoidal Salmonella or
a culture-negative stool test.
DESIGN: We identified patients with a first-time positive stool culture with C.
concisus, C. jejuni, non-typhoidal Salmonella or negative stool test, from 2009
through 2013 in North Denmark Region, Denmark, and matched each with 10
population comparisons. All subjects were followed up until 1 March 2018 using
Systematised Nomenclature of Medicine codes from The Danish Pathology Register
for incident diagnoses of CC and LC. We computed risk and adjusted HRs with 95%
CIs for MC among patients and comparisons.
RESULTS: We identified 962 patients with C. concisus, 1725 with C. jejuni, 446
with Salmonella and 11 825 patients with culture-negative stools. The MC risk and
HR versus comparisons were high for patients with C. concisus (risk 6.2%, HR 32.4
(95% CI 18.9 to 55.6)), less for C. jejuni (risk 0.6%, HR 3.7 (95% CI 1.8 to
7.7)), low for Salmonella (risk 0.4%, HR 2.2 (95% CI 0.5 to 10.8)) and for
patients with negative stool testing (risk 3.3%, HR 19.6 (95% CI 16.4 to 23.4)). 
After exclusion of the first year of follow-up, the HRs were 9.3 (95% CI 4.1 to
20.1), 2.2 (95% CI 0.9 to 5.4), 1.3 (95% CI 0.2 to 11.1) and 5.6 (95% CI 4.6 to
7.2), respectively.
CONCLUSION: A high risk of MC was observed following C. concisus in stools.
Further studies are needed to elucidate any underlying biological mechanisms.
