Streptococcus constellatus is an oropharyngeal commensal Gram-positive coccus,
frequently associated with the respiratory tract. S. constellatus is part of the 
Streptococcus anginosus or milleri group, which has traditionally been considered
to have propensity to cause empyema and purulent abscesses, a property that is
sometimes overlooked as the severity of infections it causes may have a varying
degree. In this case, we present the case of a 54-year-old male with known liver 
cirrhosis who developed a severe empyema during an acute liver failure episode,
requiring extensive decortication and prolonged hospital admission.
