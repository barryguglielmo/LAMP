OBJECTIVE: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an important multidrug-resistant
pathogen that is associated with various of serious nosocomial infections. In our
study, we investigated the traits of antimicrobial resistance of a clinical
isolated strain of S. maltophilia, which was termed as CYZ from the sputum of an 
immunocompromised patient.
METHODS: The whole genome sequence of S. maltophilia CYZ was investigated via the
Pacbio RS II system. The functions of all the predicted genes were annotated by
the COG, GO and KEGG databases. Several types of antibiotics were selected to
test the antimicrobial susceptibility, and the phylogenetic tree was constructed 
that based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences.
RESULTS: S. maltophilia CYZ has a length of 4,517,685 bp and contains 4,077
predicted genes, with an average G + C content of 66.65%. Functional genomic
analysis via the annotations of the COG and GO databases revealed that the
bacteria exhibited specific manners to resist the antibiotics. The annotated
genes that were involved in flagella, pili or fimbriae, biofilm formation,
polysaccharide, and cyclic-di-GMP may contribute to promote the ability of
antimicrobial resistance. This bacterium showed sensitivity to levofloxacin,
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and minocycline via antibiotics sensitivity tests.
Phylogenetic relationship indicated that S. maltophilia CYZ exhibited closely
relation to the strains of S. maltophilia, which were isolated from the
nosocomial environment.
CONCLUSIONS: The current results give us a better understanding of the genetic
characteristics of the antimicrobial resistance of S. maltophilia CYZ, and
provide well genetic basis for further studying on the phenotype.
