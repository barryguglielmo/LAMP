Multiple resistance and pH adaptation (Mrp) antiporters are multi-subunit Na+ (or
K+)/H+ exchangers representing an ancestor of many essential redox-driven proton 
pumps, such as respiratory complex I. The mechanism of coupling between ion or
electron transfer and proton translocation in this large protein family is
unknown. Here, we present the structure of the Mrp complex from Anoxybacillus
flavithermus solved by cryo-EM at 3.0 Å resolution. It is a dimer of
seven-subunit protomers with 50 trans-membrane helices each. Surface charge
distribution within each monomer is remarkably asymmetric, revealing probable
proton and sodium translocation pathways. On the basis of the structure we
propose a mechanism where the coupling between sodium and proton translocation is
facilitated by a series of electrostatic interactions between a cation and key
charged residues. This mechanism is likely to be applicable to the entire family 
of redox proton pumps, where electron transfer to substrates replaces cation
movements.
