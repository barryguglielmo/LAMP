Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) is a worldwide distributed virus that has a very wide 
host range and causes significant crop losses of many economically important
crops, including potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). In this study, the antiviral
activity of Bacillus licheniformis strain POT1 against AMV on potato plants was
evaluated. The dual foliar application of culture filtrate (CF), 24 h before and 
after AMV-inoculation, was the most effective treatment that showed 86.79%
reduction of the viral accumulation level and improvement of different growth
parameters. Moreover, HPLC analysis showed that a 20 polyphenolic compound was
accumulated with a total amount of 7,218.86 and 1606.49 mg/kg in POT1-treated and
non-treated plants, respectively. Additionally, the transcriptional analysis of
thirteen genes controlling the phenylpropanoid, chlorogenic acid and flavonoid
biosynthetic pathways revealed that most of the studied genes were induced after 
POT1 treatments. The stronger expression level of F3H, the key enzyme in
flavonoid biosynthesis in plants, (588.133-fold) and AN2, anthocyanin 2
transcription factor, (97.005-fold) suggested that the accumulation flavonoid,
especially anthocyanin, might play significant roles in plant defense against
viral infection. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis showed
that pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine-1,4-dione is the major compound in CF ethyl acetate
extract, that is suggesting it acts as elicitor molecules for induction of
systemic acquired resistance in potato plants. To our knowledge, this is the
first study of biological control of AMV mediated by PGPR in potato plants.
