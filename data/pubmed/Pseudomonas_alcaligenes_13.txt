In this study, we investigated the effects of environmental factors such as
airflow velocity, relative humidity (RH), temperature, and duct reflectance on
the performance of in-duct UVC lamps. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas
alcaligenes, and Escherichia coli were used as the test bacteria. The UV
irradiance, disinfection efficacy, and UV susceptibility constant (Z value) of
the test bacteria were experimentally determined. The results showed that the UV 
disinfection efficacy decreased as the airflow velocity and RH increased. The
maximum UV disinfection efficacy was obtained at temperature of 20-21°C compared 
with the performance at lower temperature (15-16°C) and higher temperature
(25-26°C). When the RH increased from 50% to 90%, the Z values of airborne
bacteria reduced by 40%, 60%, and 38% for S epidermidis, P alcaligenes, and E
coli, respectively. Besides, susceptibility constants had lower values under both
cooling temperature (15-16°C) and heating temperature (25-26°C) compared with
that under the temperature of 20-21°C. It was observed that S epidermidis
generally had the highest resistance to the UV irradiance. The results also
showed that the UV disinfection efficacy was lower in the duct with a black
surface than in the clean duct.
