PURPOSE: Brainstem abscess is a rare condition accounting for merely 1% of brain 
abscesses incidence in the pediatric population. This study aimed to present a
single patient with a pontine abscess and review the literature to highlight
clinical features, diagnosis, and management of brainstem abscess.
METHODS: The PubMed database was screened for English-language articles
concerning pediatric brainstem abscess. We, therefore, identified 22
publications, which concisely depict 23 cases. Our study reports on the 24th
pediatric patient diagnosed with that entity. All included reports were analyzed 
in terms of clinical presentation, diagnosis, management, and outcomes of
described patients.
RESULTS: There was slight women predominance (15:9), with a mean age of
occurrence 6.4 years, ranging from 7 months to 16 years. Pons was the most common
location of brainstem abscess, occurring in 75% of patients. Clinically, they
mostly presented with cranial nerves palsy (79.2%), hemiparesis (66.7%), and
pyramidal signs (45.8%). The classic triad of symptoms, including fever,
headache, and the focal neurologic deficit was present in 20.8% of patients.
Positive pus cultures were obtained in 61.1%. Streptococci and Staphylococci were
the most frequently identified pus microorganisms. Outcomes were satisfactory,
with a 79.2% rate of general improvement.
CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgical aspiration is a safe and beneficial therapeutic
method. It should always be considered and should promptly be performed when the 
conservative treatment is not successful and clinical deterioration occurs.
Prognosis in pediatric brainstem abscess is generally favorable. Most patients
recover with minor neurologic deficits or improve completely.
