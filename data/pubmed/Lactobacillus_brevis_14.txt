The use of antimicrobial agents within a matrix, specifically layered compounds, 
is of growing interest for reducing contamination due to food borne pathogens and
deteriorative microorganisms, one of the main health problems worldwide. In this 
study, zinc layered hydroxide nanoparticles were synthesized as a matrix for
nisin immobilization. Layered materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, 
Fourier-Transform Infrared and Ultra Violet-Visible spectra, Scanning Electron
Microscopy, and by Thermogravimetric Analysis. Thermal, chemical, enzymatic, and 
biological stabilities were assessed against Lactobacillus brevis as control
strain. Free and immobilized nisin in solution were previously subjected to 25
and 121 °C, pH (7, 9) and inactivation with protease before antimicrobial tests
that lasted 21 days. Immobilized nisin was found to maintain the activity levels 
after the protease action while the pure nisin solution lost its activity
gradually. Furthermore, immobilized nisin treated at 121 °C and pH 7 showed
higher activity than pure nisin after 21 days. These results may support that
immobilizing nisin in zinc layered hydroxide salts promoted extended nisin
inhibitory activity in solution after thermal, chemical or enzymatic treatments. 
This research provides an alternative to nisin application that could be used in 
processes where such operating conditions take place, as in dairy products.
