580 microbial strains were isolated from the rhizosphere of the plants Cucurbita 
pepo L. and Xanthium strumarium grown on soil contaminated with
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolites. During the
cultivation, two bacterial strains were selected because of their ability to grow
on media containing 0.5-5.0â€‰mg L-1 of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) as
the sole carbon source. They were identified as Bacillus vallismortis and
Bacillus aryabhattai. Both of these species were shown to have a high capacity
for the utilization of DDE - more than 90% of which was consumed after 21 days of
cultivation. Laboratory experiments were carried out then to assess the
possibility of using these strains for the decontamination of organochlorine
pesticides (OCPs) contaminated soils. Inoculation of C. pepo and X. strumarium
with our isolates B. vallismortis and B. aryabhattai resulted in a reduction of
the pollutant stress to the plants as shown by an increase both in aboveground
and in root biomass. The microorganisms enhanced the uptake and
phytostabilization potential of C. pepo and X. strumarium and can be applied for 
the treatment of DDE contaminated soils.
