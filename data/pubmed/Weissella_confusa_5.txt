PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to isolate and identify strains of
bacteria from feces of healthy human and screen potential probiotic candidate by 
using culturomics method combined with the matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrum (MALDI-TOF MS) and 16S rRNA
gene sequencing.
METHODS AND RESULTS: 31 strains were isolated and purified from human feces by
culturomics method, and identified by MALDI-TOF MS and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. 
Then the obtained strains were tested for haemolytic activity, antibiotic
susceptibility, acid and bile salts tolerance, antimicrobial activity,
morphological and physiological characteristics. Three potential probiotic
candidate strains named YM5Y, YM5S1 and YM5S2 were selected and identified as
Weissella confusa.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the culturomics approach could be used to isolate
and screen human fecal strains which could eventually be used for the development
of novel probiotics. In addition, the isolated strains of W. confusa can act as
potential probiotics and should be explored further for their potential
application.
