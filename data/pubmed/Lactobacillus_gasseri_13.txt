BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus gasseri OLL2809 can highly induce interleukin (IL)-12
production in immune cells. Even though beneficial properties of this strain for 
both humans and animals have been reported, the mechanism by which the bacteria
induces the production of IL-12 in immune cells remains elusive. In this study,
we investigated the mechanism of induction of IL-12 using a mouse macrophage cell
line J774.1.
RESULTS: Inhibition of phagocytosis of L. gasseri OLL2809, and myeloid
differentiation factor 88 and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 7 and 9 signalling
attenuated IL-12 production in J774.1 cells. Total RNA and genomic DNA of L.
gasseri OLL2809, when transferred to the J774.1 cells, also induced IL-12
production. The difference in the IL-12-inducing activity of Lactobacilli is
attributed to the susceptibility to phagocytosis, but not to a difference in the 
total RNA and genomic DNA of each strain.
CONCLUSION: We concluded that total RNA and genomic DNA of phagocytosed L.
gasseri OLL2809 induce IL-12 production in J774.1 cell via TLRs 7 and 9, and the 
high IL-12-inducing activity of L. gasseri OLL2809 is due to its greater
susceptibility to phagocytosis.
