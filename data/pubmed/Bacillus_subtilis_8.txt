BACKGROUND: Bacterial spores displaying heterologous antigens or enzymes have
long been proposed as mucosal vaccines, functionalized probiotics or
biocatalysts. Two main strategies have been developed to display heterologous
molecules on the surface of Bacillus subtilis spores: (i) a recombinant approach,
based on the construction of a gene fusion between a gene coding for a coat
protein (carrier) and DNA coding for the protein to be displayed, and (ii) a
non-recombinant approach, based on the spontaneous and stable adsorption of
heterologous molecules on the spore surface. Both systems have advantages and
drawbacks and the selection of one or the other depends on the protein to be
displayed and on the final use of the activated spore. It has been recently shown
that B. subtilis builds structurally and functionally different spores when grown
at different temperatures; based on this finding B. subtilis spores prepared at
25, 37 or 42 °C were compared for their efficiency in displaying various model
proteins by either the recombinant or the non-recombinant approach.
RESULTS: Immune- and fluorescence-based assays were used to analyze the display
of several model proteins on spores prepared at 25, 37 or 42 °C. Recombinant
spores displayed different amounts of the same fusion protein in response to the 
temperature of spore production. In spores simultaneously displaying two fusion
proteins, each of them was differentially displayed at the various temperatures. 
The display by the non-recombinant approach was only modestly affected by the
temperature of spore production, with spores prepared at 37 or 42 °C slightly
more efficient than 25 °C spores in adsorbing at least some of the model proteins
tested.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the temperature of spore production allows 
control of the display of heterologous proteins on spores and, therefore, that
the spore-display strategy can be optimized for the specific final use of the
activated spores by selecting the display approach, the carrier protein and the
temperature of spore production.
