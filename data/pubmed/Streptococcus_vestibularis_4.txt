BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest that the nose/throat microbiome may play an 
important role in shaping host immunity and modifying the risk of respiratory
infection. Our aim is to quantify the association between the nose/throat
microbiome and susceptibility to influenza virus infection.
METHODS: In this household transmission study, index cases with confirmed
influenza virus infection and their household contacts were followed for 9-12
days to identify secondary influenza infections. Respiratory swabs were collected
at enrollment to identify and quantify bacterial species via high-performance
sequencing. Data were analyzed by an individual hazard-based transmission model
that was adjusted for age, vaccination, and household size.
RESULTS: We recruited 115 index cases with influenza A(H3N2) or B infection and
436 household contacts. We estimated that a 10-fold increase in the abundance in 
Streptococcus spp. and Prevotella salivae was associated with 48% (95% credible
interval [CrI], 9-69%) and 25% (95% CrI, 0.5-42%) lower susceptibility to
influenza A(H3N2) infection, respectively. In contrast, for influenza B
infection, a 10-fold increase in the abundance in Streptococcus vestibularis and 
Prevotella spp. was associated with 63% (95% CrI, 17-83%) lower and 83% (95% CrI,
15-210%) higher susceptibility, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Susceptibility to influenza infection is associated with the
nose/throat microbiome at the time of exposure. The effects of oligotypes on
susceptibility differ between influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses. Our results
suggest that microbiome may be a useful predictor of susceptibility, with the
implication that microbiome could be modulated to reduce influenza infection
risk, should these associations be causal.
