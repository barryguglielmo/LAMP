Paenibacillus larvae and Melissococcus plutonius are bacterial pathogens of honey
bee brood. As decontamination of beekeeping equipment, including combs, is
essential to control these pathogens, we evaluated the disinfecting effects of
slightly acidic hypochlorous acid water (SAHAW) and weakly acidified chlorous
acid water (WACAW) on the pathogens. Both disinfectants exhibited strong
disinfecting effects in suspension tests under no organic matter conditions and
reduced both pathogens by >5 log10 CFU/ml. Although the microbicidal activity of 
SAHAW with an available chlorine concentration (ACC) of 10-30 ppm was decreased
by organic matter, it reduced viable P. larvae spores in combs more efficiently
than H2O when the comb was not as dirty. However, its efficacy on combs decreased
at 4°C and when overused or highly contaminated combs were tested. WACAW with an 
ACC of ≥600 ppm had a higher disinfecting capacity than SAHAW, and efficiently
removed P. larvae spores from combs even under organic matter-rich and
low-temperature conditions. However, even by WACAW, the amount of viable spores
in combs was not markedly reduced depending on contamination levels and P. larvae
genotypes. These results suggest the usefulness of both disinfectants for
decontaminating beekeeping equipment depending on the situations expected.
