meso-Diaminopimelate dehydrogenase (meso-DAPDH) catalyzes the reversible NADP+
-dependent oxidative deamination of meso-2,6-diaminopimelate (meso-DAP) to
produce l-2-amino-6-oxopimelate. Moreover, d-amino acid dehydrogenase (d-AADHs)
derived from protein-engineered meso-DAPDH is useful for one-step synthesis of
d-amino acids with high optical purity. Here, we report the identification and
functional characterization of a novel NAD(P)+ -dependent meso-DAPDH from Numidum
massiliense (NmDAPDH). After the gene encoding the putative NmDAPDH was expressed
in recombinant Escherichia coli cells, the enzyme was purified 4.0-fold to
homogeneity from the crude extract through five purification steps. Although the 
previously known meso-DAPDHs use only NADP+ as a coenzyme, NmDAPDH was able to
use both NADP+ and NAD+ as coenzymes. When NADP+ was used as a coenzyme, NmDAPDH 
exhibited an approximately 2 times higher kcat /Km value toward meso-DAP than
that of meso-DAPDH from Symbiobacterium thermophilum (StDAPDH). NmDAPDH also
catalyzed the reductive amination of corresponding 2-oxo acids to produce acidic 
d-amino acids such as d-aspartate and d-glutamate. The optimum pH and temperature
for the oxidative deamination of meso-DAP were about 10.5 and 75°C, respectively.
Like StDAPDH, NmDAPDH exhibited high stability: it retained more than 75% of its 
activity after 30 min at 60°C (pH 7.2) or at pHs ranging from 5.5 to 13.0 (50°C).
Alignment of the amino acid sequences of NmDAPDH and the known meso-DAPDHs
suggested NmDAPDH has a hexameric structure. Given its specificity for both NADP+
and NAD+ , high stability, and a broad range of reductive amination activity
toward 2-oxo acids, NmDAPDH appears to offer advantages for engineering a more
effective d-AADH.
