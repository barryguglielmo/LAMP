The association of Prevotella bivia (P. bivia), a Gram negative obligate
anaerobic bacillus with brain abscess has been rarely reported. We hereby, report
a case of brain abscess in a 50-year-old man, who suffered a head trauma followed
by decompression surgery 10 months ago. Aspirated pus sample grew Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and P. bivia sensitive to metronidazole.
The patient recovered well after a brain abscess evacuation surgery and
post-operative metronidazole therapy, confirming the pathogenic role of P. bivia 
in this case.
