OBJECTIVE: This pilot study aimed to evaluate whether different microbial
compositions cause symptoms in patients with Lactobacillus overgrowth and to
investigate the variation in Lactobacillus microbiome in cytolytic vaginosis
(CV).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lactobacillus species were identified from the vaginal
fluid of 70 healthy women and 79 patients with CV using molecular analysis of the
16S rRNA gene. Ï‡ and Fisher exact tests were used to compare the isolated rates
of Lactobacillus species between the 2 groups. The capabilities of dominant
Lactobacillus strain to produce acid in the 2 groups were analyzed by repeated
measures analysis of variance.
RESULTS: The isolation of 2 or more Lactobacillus species per vaginal sampling
was significantly less common in the CV group (1.3%) compared with the healthy
control (HC) group 12.2% (p = .013). Significant differences in Lactobacillus
species were observed between the 2 groups (p < .001). Lactobacillus crispatus
was more often found in the CV group (88.7%) than in the HC group (56.4%, p <
.001). Compared with that in the HC group, the dominant L. crispatus strain in
the CV group tended to produce more acid.
CONCLUSIONS: The CV group carried a less diverse Lactobacillus species,
vaginally. Lactobacillus crispatus was common to both CV and HC groups but
demonstrated enhanced acid-producing capability in the CV group. The pathogenesis
of CV may be based, in part, on an overgrowth of L. crispatus with enhanced
acid-producing capability.
