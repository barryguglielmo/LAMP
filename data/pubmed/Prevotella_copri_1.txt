We aimed to explore the effects of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and
hypoglycemic therapy on the salivary microbiome in periodontitis patients and
identify the potential salivary micro-biomarker for the early warning of T2DM.
Saliva samples were collected from healthy individuals (Health), periodontitis
patients (P), T2DM patients, periodontitis patients with T2DM (DAP), and DAP
patients treated with Metformin (Met). Samples were determined by16S rRNA gene
sequencing. 29 phyla, 322 genera, and 333 species of salivary microbiome were
annotated. Compared to the Health group, the P and DAP group showed a
significantly higher diversity of saliva microbiota, while the T2DM and Met group
had no significant difference in microbial abundance but showed a trend of
increasing diversity. Other than well-known periodontitis-inducing pathogens, the
proportion of Prevotella copri, Alloprevotella rava, and Ralstonia pickettii,
etc. were also significantly increased in periodontitis patients with or without 
T2DM. After effective glycemic control, the abundance of Prevotella copri,
Alloprevotella rava, Ralstonia pickettii, etc. decreased in periodontitis
patients with companion T2DM. The accuracies of the classification models in
differentiating Health-vs.-P, DAP-vs.-P, and T2DM-vs.-P were 100%, 96.3%, and
98.1%, respectively. Hypoglycemic therapy could reconstruct the saliva microbiota
and hence improve the localized conditions of diabetes patients with
periodontitis.
