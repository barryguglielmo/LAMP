A novel actinomycete, designated strain LAM7112T, was isolated from soil sample
collected from a birch forest in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. The new
isolate was found to be able to grow at 20-45 °C (optimum: 35 °C), pH 5.0-10.0
(optimum: 7.0) and in the presence of 0-10.0% (optimum: 3.0%) (w/v) NaCl. The
isolate formed very scantily irregular sporangia containing motile spores on the 
substrate mycelium. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated
that the new isolate was closely related to members of the family
Micromonosporaceae, with highest similarites to Actinoplanes ferrugineus X-14695T
(97.4%), Micromonospora zamorensis DSM 45600T (97.3%) and Micromonospora
aurantiaca ATCC 27029T (97.3%). In the phylogenetic trees, strain LAM7112T formed
a stable phylogenetic subclade within the genus Actinoplanes. The genomic DNA
G + C content was 70.0 mol%. The major fatty acids (> 10%) were determined to be 
iso-C16:0, anteiso-C15:0 and anteiso-C17:0. The predominant menaquinones were
identified as MK-9 (H2), MK-9 (H4) and MK-9 (H6). The major polar lipids were
found to be diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol and
phosphatidylethanolamine. The diagnostic amino acid of the cell wall
peptidoglycan was determined to be meso-diaminopimelic acid. The diagnostic
sugars in cell hydrolysates were determined to be glucose and ribose. On the
basis of its phenotypic, phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, strain 
LAM7112T (= CGMCC 4.7580T = JCM 32512T) is proposed to represent the type strain 
of a novel species of the genus Actinoplanes, for which the name Actinoplanes
solisilvae is proposed.
