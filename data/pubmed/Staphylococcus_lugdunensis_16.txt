Staphylococci are a key component of the human microbiota, and they mainly
colonize the skin and anterior nares. However, they can cause infection in
hospitalized patients and healthy individuals in the community. Although majority
of the Staphylococcus aureus strains are coagulase-positive, some do not produce 
coagulase, and the isolation of coagulase-positive non-S. aureus isolates in
humans is increasingly being reported. Therefore, sound knowledge of the species 
and characteristics of staphylococci in a given setting is important, especially 
isolates from children and immunocompromised individuals. The spectrum of
Staphylococcus species colonizing children in Uganda is poorly understood; here, 
we aimed to determine the species and characteristics of staphylococci isolated
from children in Eastern Uganda. Seven hundred and sixty four healthy children
less than 5 years residing in Iganga and Mayuge districts in Eastern Uganda were 
enrolled. A total of 513 staphylococci belonging to 13 species were isolated from
485 children (63.5%, 485/764), with S. aureus being the dominant species (37.6%, 
193/513) followed by S. epidermidis (25.5%, 131/513), S. haemolyticus (2.3%,
12/513), S. hominis (0.8%, 4/513) and S. haemolyticus/lugdunensis (0.58%, 3/513).
Twenty four (4.95%, 24/485) children were co-colonized by two or more
Staphylococcus species. With the exception of penicillin, antimicrobial
resistance (AMR) rates were low; all isolates were susceptible to vancomycin,
teicoplanin, linezolid and daptomycin. The prevalence of methicillin resistance
was 23.8% (122/513) and it was highest in S. haemolyticus (66.7%, 8/12) followed 
by S. aureus (28.5%, 55/193) and S. epidermidis (23.7%, 31/131). The prevalence
of multidrug resistance was 20.3% (104/513), and 59% (72/122) of methicillin
resistant staphylococci were multidrug resistant. Four methicillin susceptible S.
aureus isolates and a methicillin resistant S. scuiri isolate were mupirocin
resistant (high-level). The most frequent AMR genes were mecA, vanA, ant(4')-Ia, 
and aac(6')-Ie- aph(2'')-Ia, pointing to presence of AMR drivers in the
community.
