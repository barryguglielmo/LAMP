Septic knee arthritis is a common disease, mostly due to bacterial infections. We
describe a rare case of Haemophilus haemolyticus causing unilateral septic
arthritis of a native knee. The affected patient presented with persistent severe
knee pain after repeated intra-articular injections. Patient history included
knee arthroscopy and a known rheumatoid arthritis treated by steroids. Since
conservative treatment was ineffective and infection could not be excluded,
diagnostic arthroscopy was performed. Synovial fluid and biopsies verified the
uncommon microorganism and antibiotic therapy was initiated. Clinical findings
and blood results showed rapid improvement. The patient was discharged in a good 
condition after 6 weeks. A review of the current literature describes only one
joint infection with H. haemolyticus as underlying cause. In immunocompromised
patients with septic knee arthritis also atypical pathogens must be considered.
Nevertheless, the established treatment algorithm with arthroscopy and
anti-infective therapy seems to be effective leading to satisfactory results.
