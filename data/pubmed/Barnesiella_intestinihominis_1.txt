BACKGROUND: The dysbiosis is defined as a disturbed symbiotic relationship
between microbiota and the host and can cause a pro-inflammatory imbalance
impairing the healing process at anastomotic level. The aim of this study is to
detect, in fecal samples collected in the preoperative time, a peculiar
microbiota composition that could predict the onset of colorectal anastomotic
leakage.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared gut microbiota of healthy patients (Group A)
and patients with colorectal cancer eligible for surgery (Group B). Group B was
divided into patients who developed anastomotic leak (Group BL) and patients who 
had uneventful recovery (Group BNL). Stool samples were collected before surgery 
and after neoadjuvant treatment.
RESULTS: We analyzed stool samples from 48 patients, 27 belonging to Group A and 
21 to Group B. In Group B, five patients developed anastomotic leakage (Group
BL). Compared to healthy subjects, Group B showed a moderate increase of
Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, a moderate reduction of Firmicutes and
Actinobacteria, and a statistically significant reduction of Faecalibacterium
prausnitzii. Group BL patients showed an array of bacterial species which
promoted dysbiosis, such as Acinetobacter lwoffii and Hafnia alvei. Group BNL
patients showed that bacterial species like Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and
Barnesiella intestinihominis have a protective function.
CONCLUSIONS: The bacterial flora in subjects with colorectal cancer is
statistically different compared to healthy patients. The presence of
preoperative aggressive bacteria and the lack of protective strains has
strengthened the hypothesis that a peculiar microbiota composition could
represent a risk factor for the occurrence of anastomotic leakage.
