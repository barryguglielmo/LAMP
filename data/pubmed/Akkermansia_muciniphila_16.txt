Akkermansia muciniphila is a well-studied anaerobic bacterium specialized in
mucus degradation and associated with human health. Because of the structural
resemblance of mucus glycans and free human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), we
studied the ability of A. muciniphila to utilize human milk oligosaccharides. We 
found that A. muciniphila was able to grow on human milk and degrade HMOs.
Analyses of the proteome of A. muciniphila indicated that key-glycan degrading
enzymes were expressed when the bacterium was grown on human milk. Our results
display the functionality of the key-glycan degrading enzymes (α-L-fucosidases,
β-galactosidases, exo-α-sialidases and β-acetylhexosaminidases) to degrade the
HMO-structures 2'-FL, LNT, lactose, and LNT2. The hydrolysation of the
host-derived glycan structures allows A. muciniphila to promote syntrophy with
other beneficial bacteria, contributing in that way to a microbial ecological
network in the gut. Thus, the capacity of A. muciniphila to utilize human milk
will enable its survival in the early life intestine and colonization of the
mucosal layer in early life, warranting later life mucosal and metabolic health.
