The significance of the complex bacterial ecosystem in the human body and the
impediment of the mammalian membrane against many antibiotics together emphasize 
the necessity to develop antimicrobial agents with precise antimicrobial and
cell-penetrating activities. A simple and feasible method for generating
dual-function antimicrobial peptides inspired by highly hydrophobic peptide
pheromone and cationic cell-penetrating peptides is presented. Furthermore, the
extension of the peptide candidate library is achieved by modifying the charged
domain. The bacteria-selective peptides L1, L2, L10, and L11 kill Streptococcus
agalactiae by disrupting the membrane structure, and the targeted mechanism is
suggested where the peptides offset the entrapment of S. agalactiae rather than
of other bacteria. Moreover, L2 and L10 possess intracellular antibacterial
activity and carrier property, which is mainly dependent on endocytosis. Given
their suitable biocompatibility, high tolerance, no drug resistance, and
effective antimicrobial capacity in a mouse mastitis model, L2 and L10 can be
powerful weapons against S. agalactiae pathogen infection.
