A Gram-stain-positive bacterial isolate, designated LMM-1652T, was isolated from 
an intrauterine cytobrush sample originating from a postpartum Holstein Friesian 
dairy cow. The strain had a rod to coccoid-shape, was catalase-positive and
oxidase-negative. 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity analyses revealed that its
closest relatives were Corynebacterium falsenii (97.05 % similarity),
Corynebacterium jeikeium (96.83 %) and Corynebacterium urealyticum (96.82 %).
Subsequent whole genome analysis showed that the genome-to-genome distance of
strain LMM-1652T to its closest relatives was in the range of 23.2-24.8 %, while 
the average nucleotide identity values ranged from 73.7 to 74.3%, thus confirming
that this isolate represents a novel species. Strain LMM-1652T was characterized 
by a quinone system mainly consisting of MK-9(H2) and MK-10(H2). The polar lipids
profile of the strain consisted mainly of diphosphatidylglycerol,
phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol-mannoside, as
well as one unidentified lipid lacking any functional group. Smaller amounts of
four unidentified phospholipids, four unidentified glycolipids, β-gentiobiosyl
diacylglycerol and four unidentified lipids lacking a functional group were also 
found. The cell wall contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino
acid of the peptidoglycan. The fatty acid profile was mainly composed of
C18 : 1 ω9c, C18 : 0 and C16 : 0. We propose a novel species of the genus
Corynebacterium with the name Corynebacterium urogenitale LMM-1652T (=LMG
31163T=DSM 108747T).
