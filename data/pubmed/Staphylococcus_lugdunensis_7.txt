Staphylococcus lugdunensis is considered more pathogenic than other
coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS), with its virulence resembling that of
Staphylococcus aureus. We report a retrospective study of all S. lugdunensis
infection cases during a 3.5-year period in a large tertiary university hospital 
in Greece. S.lugdunensis was susceptible to most tested antibiotics, although a
high resistance percentage was found to clindamycin (27%) and erythromycin (25%).
The susceptibility rate to penicillin was 49%, much lower than previously
reported elsewhere, indicating that penicillin may not be an optimal treatment
choice for S. lugdunensis infections in our region.
