BACKGROUND: Mature lysostaphin (28-kDa Lss) from Staphylococcus simulans proves 
effective in killing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) which is 
endemic in hospitals worldwide. Lss is Zn2+-dependent endopeptidase, but its
bacteriolytic activity could be affected by exogenously added Zn2+.
OBJECTIVE: To gain greater insights into structural and functional impacts of
Zn2+ and Ni2+ on Lss-induced bioactivity.
METHODS: Lss purified via immobilized metal ion-affinity chromatography was
assessed for bioactivity using turbidity reduction assays. Conformational change 
of metal ion-treated Lss was examined by circular dichroism and intrinsic
fluorescence spectroscopy. Co-sedimentation assay was performed to study
interactions between Zn2+-treated Lss and S. aureus peptidoglycans. Metal
ion-binding prediction and intermolecular docking were used to locate an
extraneous Zn2+-binding site.
RESULTS: A drastic decrease in Lss bioactivity against S. aureus and MRSA was
revealed only when treated with Zn2+, but not Ni2+, albeit no negative effect of 
diethyldithiocarbamate-Zn2+-chelator on Lss-induced bioactivity. No severe
conformational change was observed for Lss incubated with exogenous Zn2+ or Ni2+.
Lss pre-treated with Zn2+ efficiently bound to S. aureus cell-wall
peptidoglycans, suggesting non-interfering effect of exogenous metal ions on
cell-wall targeting (CWT) activity. In silico analysis revealed that exogenous
Zn2+, but not Ni2+, preferably interacted with a potential extraneous
Zn2+-binding site (His253, Glu318 and His323) placed near the Zn2+- coordinating 
Lss-active site within the catalytic (CAT) domain.
CONCLUSION: Our present data signify the adverse influence of exogenous Zn2+ ions
on Lss-induced staphylolytic activity through the exclusive presence within the
CAT domain of an extraneous inhibitory Zn2+-binding site, without affecting the
CWT activity.
