Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a rare autoinflammatory disorder of the
innate immune system. Patients with innate immune system defects are at a high
risk of meningococcal disease, although it is unclear if patients with FMF also
have increased susceptibility to invasive infection. Herein, we present a
diagnostically challenging case of a male adolescent with a past medical history 
of FMF stabilized on colchicine who presented with some of the early clinical
features of community-acquired bacterial meningitis. To our knowledge, this is
the first case of meningococcal meningitis in a patient with FMF diagnosed with
the FilmArray Meningitis/Encephalitis (ME) Panel. This case report demonstrates
that rapid detection of Neisseria meningitidis by the ME Panel can aid in the
early diagnosis and prompt treatment of patients with suspected meningitis and
may be the only positive test in patients with early presentation and/or prior
antimicrobial therapy.
