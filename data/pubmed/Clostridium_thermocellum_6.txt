The production of volatile industrial chemicals utilizing metabolically
engineered extreme thermophiles offers the potential for processes with
simultaneous fermentation and product separation. An excellent target chemical
for such a process is acetone (Tb  = 56°C), ideally produced from lignocellulosic
biomass. Caldicellulosiruptor bescii (Topt 78°C), an extremely thermophilic
fermentative bacterium naturally capable of deconstructing and fermenting
lignocellulose, was metabolically engineered to produce acetone. When the acetone
pathway construct was integrated into a parent strain containing the bifunctional
alcohol dehydrogenase from Clostridium thermocellum, acetone was produced at
9.1 mM (0.53 g/L), in addition to minimal ethanol 3.3 mM (0.15 g/L), along with
net acetate consumption. This demonstrates that C. bescii can be engineered with 
balanced pathways in which renewable carbohydrate sources are converted to useful
metabolites, primarily acetone and H2 , without net production of its native
fermentation products, acetate and lactate.
