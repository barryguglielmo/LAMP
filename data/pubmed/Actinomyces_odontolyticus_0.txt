Host range is a fundamental component of symbiotic interactions, yet it remains
poorly characterized for the prevalent yet enigmatic subcategory of
bacteria/bacteria symbioses. The recently characterized obligate bacterial
epibiont Candidatus Nanosynbacter lyticus TM7x with its bacterial host
Actinomyces odontolyticus XH001 offers an ideal system to study such a novel
relationship. In this study, the host range of TM7x was investigated by
coculturing TM7x with various related Actinomyces strains and characterizing
their growth dynamics from initial infection through subsequent co-passages. Of
the twenty-seven tested Actinomyces, thirteen strains, including XH001, could
host TM7x, and further classified into "permissive" and "nonpermissive" based on 
their varying initial responses to TM7x. Ten permissive strains exhibited
growth/crash/recovery phases following TM7x infection, with crash timing and
extent dependent on initial TM7x dosage. Meanwhile, three nonpermissive strains
hosted TM7x without a growth-crash phase despite high TM7x dosage. The physical
association of TM7x with all hosts, including nonpermissive strains, was
confirmed by microscopy. Comparative genomic analyses revealed distinguishing
genomic features between permissive and nonpermissive hosts. Our results expand
the concept of host range beyond a binary to a wider spectrum, and the varying
susceptibility of Actinomyces strains to TM7x underscores how small genetic
differences between hosts can underly divergent selective trajectories.
