A strictly anaerobic predominant bacterium, designated as strain gm001T, was
isolated from a freshly voided faecal sample collected from a healthy Taiwanese
adult. Cells were Gram-stain-negative rods, non-motile and non-spore-forming.
Strain gm001T was identified as a member of the genus Prevotella, and a
comparison of 16S rRNA and hsp60 gene sequences revealed sequence similarities of
98.5 and 93.3 %, respectively, demonstrating that it was most closely related to 
the type strain of Prevotella copri. Phylogenomic tree analysis indicated that
the gm001T cluster is an independent lineage of P. copri DSM 18205T. The average 
nucleotide identity, digital DNA‒DNA hybridization and average amino acid
identity values between strain gm001T and P. copri DSM 18205T were 80.9, 28.6 and
83.8 %, respectively, which were clearly lower than the species delineation
thresholds. The species-specific genes of this novel species were also identified
on the basis of pan-genomic analysis. The predominant menaquinones were MK-11 and
MK-12, and the predominant fatty acids were anteiso-C15 : 0, C15 : 0 and
iso-C15 : 0. Acetate and succinate were produced from glucose as metabolic end
products. Taken together, the results indicate that strain gm001T represents a
novel species of the genus Prevotella, for which the name Prevotella hominis sp. 
nov. is proposed. The type strain is gm001T (=BCRC 81118T=JCM 33280T).
