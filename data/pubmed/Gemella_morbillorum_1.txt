Background: The focus of this study was to explore potential differences in
colonic mucosal microbiota in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients compared to
a control group utilizing a metagenomic study.
Methods: Mucosal microbiota samples were collected from each IBS patient
utilizing jet-flushing colonic mucosa in unified segments of the colon with
distilled water, followed by aspiration, during colonoscopy. All the purified
dsDNA was extracted and quantified before metagenomic sequencing using an
Illumina platform. An equal number of healthy age-matched controls were also
examined for colonic mucosal microbiota, which were obtained during screening
colonoscopies.
Results: The microbiota data on 50 IBS patients (31 females), with a mean age
43.94 ± 14.50 (range19-65), were analyzed in comparison to 50 controls.
Satisfactory DNA samples were subjected to metagenomics study, followed by
comprehensive comparative phylogenetic analysis. Metagenomics analysis was
carried out, and 3.58G reads were sequenced. Community richness (Chao) and
microbial structure in IBS patients were shown to be significantly different from
those in the control group. Enrichment of Oxalobacter formigenes, Sutterella
wadsworthensis, and Bacteroides pectinophilus was significantly observed in
controls, whereas enrichment of Collinsella aerofaciens, Gemella morbillorum, and
Veillonella parvula Actinobacteria was observed significantly in the IBS cohort.
Conclusion: The current study has demonstrated significant differences in the
microbiota of IBS patients compared to controls.
