BACKGROUND: Variability in the health effects of dietary fiber might arise from
inter-individual differences in the gut microbiota's ability to ferment these
substrates into beneficial metabolites. Our understanding of what drives this
individuality is vastly incomplete and will require an ecological perspective as 
microbiomes function as complex inter-connected communities. Here, we performed a
parallel two-arm, exploratory randomized controlled trial in 31 adults with
overweight and class-I obesity to characterize the effects of long-chain, complex
arabinoxylan (n = 15) at high supplementation doses (female: 25 g/day; male: 35
g/day) on gut microbiota composition and short-chain fatty acid production as
compared to microcrystalline cellulose (n = 16, non-fermentable control), and
integrated the findings using an ecological framework.
RESULTS: Arabinoxylan resulted in a global shift in fecal bacterial community
composition, reduced α-diversity, and the promotion of specific taxa, including
operational taxonomic units related to Bifidobacterium longum, Blautia obeum, and
Prevotella copri. Arabinoxylan further increased fecal propionate concentrations 
(p = 0.012, Friedman's test), an effect that showed two distinct groupings of
temporal responses in participants. The two groups showed differences in
compositional shifts of the microbiota (p ≤ 0.025, PERMANOVA), and multiple
linear regression (MLR) analyses revealed that the propionate response was
predictable through shifts and, to a lesser degree, baseline composition of the
microbiota. Principal components (PCs) derived from community data were better
predictors in MLR models as compared to single taxa, indicating that arabinoxylan
fermentation is the result of multi-species interactions within microbiomes.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that long-chain arabinoxylan modulates both
microbiota composition and the output of health-relevant SCFAs, providing
information for a more targeted application of this fiber. Variation in
propionate production was linked to both compositional shifts and baseline
composition, with PCs derived from shifts of the global microbial community
showing the strongest associations. These findings constitute a proof-of-concept 
for the merit of an ecological framework that considers features of the wider gut
microbial community for the prediction of metabolic outcomes of dietary fiber
fermentation. This provides a basis to personalize the use of dietary fiber in
nutritional application and to stratify human populations by relevant gut
microbiota features to account for the inconsistent health effects in human
intervention studies.
