A novel strategy was used to produce inulin fructotransferase from Arthrobacter
aurescens (Aa-IFTase) embedded in curdlan-based mesoporous silica microspheres
(CMSiM-Aa-IFTase). The CMSiM-Aa-IFTase was constructed by co-entrapping
cross-linked Aa-IFTase aggregates and curdlan into biomemitic silica, and the
curdlan was subsequently removed by digestion with endo-β-1,3-glucanase. During
this process, the curdlan served as an agent to introduce pores in silica
microspheres. The resulting CMSiM-Aa-IFTase showed higher stability and activity 
than free Aa-IFTase and mCLEAs-Aa-IFTase (modified cross-linked enzyme aggregates
with Aa-IFTase). Furthermore, the CMSiM-Aa-IFTase displayed good reusability and 
excellent storage stability. The excellent catalytic performances were due to the
combinational structure from the cross-linked enzyme aggregates and hard shell of
mesoporous silica microspheres, which might decrease the negative interaction
between support and enzyme, and improve the mechanical properties. The
CMSiM-Aa-IFTase was applicable for efficient production of Difructose Anhydride
III (DFA III), and this approach should be highly valuable for preparing various 
mesoporous composites for catalysis.
