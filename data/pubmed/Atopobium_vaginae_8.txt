Diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis (BV) in resource-poor settings relies on
semiquantitative microscopy algorithm such as the Nugent score (NS). We evaluated
a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay to detect and quantify individual
BV-associated bacterial communities. Vaginal swabs from 247 South African women
attending an STI clinic were evaluated for BV using NS. We used qPCR to analyze
DNA from vaginal swabs for eight BV-associated bacteria, Gardnerella vaginalis
(GV), Prevotella bivia (PB), BV-associated bacteria 2 (BVAB2), Megasphaera-1
(M-1), Atopobium vaginae (AV), Lactobacillus crispatus (LC), Lactobacillus
jensenii (LJ), and Lactobacillus iners (LI). Sensitivities and specificities were
generated for each qPCR assay. Using a ROC analysis, cutoffs were calculated for 
each bacterial species. A logistic regression model was used to determine the
strongest predictors of BV status. Nugent scores indicated 35.6% of patients
harbor BV-associated flora (NS 7-10). AV, GV, GAMB (GV + AV + M-1 + BVAB2), and
LC + LJ showed the highest AUC, sensitivities, and specificities (listed
respectively): AV (0.96; 96%; 93%), GV (0.88; 78%; 79%), GAMB (0.9; 87%; 82%),
and LC + LJ (0.84; 82%; 72%) (all p < 0.05). Increased GAMB copies
(effect = 0.15, p = 0.01) and decreased LC + LJ copies (effect = - 0.26,
p < 0.0001) demonstrated the strongest association with higher BV scoring.
Scoring of BV did not differ across our qPCR assay when compared to the
commercial BD MAX® and the gold standard Nugent scores. We developed an accurate 
assay, which has the potential to be used as a BV diagnosis tool that is
cost-effective and has the potential to be utilized in a resource limited
setting.
