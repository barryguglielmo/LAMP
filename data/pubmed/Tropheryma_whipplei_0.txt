A 59-year-old female patient was diagnosed with Whipple's disease (WD) after
several months of constitutional complaints and adenopathies that were initially 
misinterpreted as sarcoidosis. Initial treatment included doxycycline,
hydroxychloroquine and prednisolone, which was suspended due to long-term
clinical stability. Four months after prednisolone suspension, the patient
presented with right periorbital oedema and erythema. Ophthalmological
examination revealed restricted eye movements. A computed tomography (CT) scan
demonstrated signs of myositis. The patient was treated with anti-inflammatory
and antibiotic drugs, that induced remission of the orbitopathy. During the
following two years, she presented three relapses, affecting both the right or
the left eyes. The last episode was also associated with systemic corticosteroid 
tapering. Orbitopathy is a rare form of WD presentation and the diagnosis of this
condition may be challenging. As the clinical spectrum may range from an
incidentaloma to a severe compressive neuropathy, proper recognition and
management of WD orbitopathy is essential.
