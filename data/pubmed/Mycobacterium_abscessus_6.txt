The first objective of this study was to determine the GenoType NTM-DR assay
performance for subspecies identification in Mycobacterium abscessus complex
isolates. The second objective was to evaluate the GenoType NTM-DR assay ability 
to detect clarithromycin and amikacin resistance in M. abscessus complex isolates
compared with drug susceptibility testing (DST) and PCR sequencing of the
erm(41), rrl and rrs genes. The concordance between the GenoType NTM-DR and MLST 
results concerning subspecies identification was 100%. The wild type and mutated 
alleles of the rrl and rrs genes were detected by the GenoType NTM-DR assay and
PCR sequencing with 100% (115/115) agreement. Similarly, 100% concordance between
GenoType NTM-DR and DST was observed for clarithromycin and amikacin testing.
Sensitivity for the detection of clarithromycin and amikacin resistance was 100%.
The GenoType NTM-DR assay provides a robust and complementary tool to the gold
standard methods (MLST and broth microdilution) for subspecies identification and
drug resistance detection.
