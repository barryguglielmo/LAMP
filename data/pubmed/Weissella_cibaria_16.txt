An exopolysaccharide (EPS) producer slimy-mucoid type colony was isolated from
sourdough and identified as Weissella cibaria MED17. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra
of EPS MED17 demonstrated that this EPS was a dextran type glucan ((1 → 6)-linked
α-D-glucose core structure) containing (1 → 3)-linked α-D-glucose branches and
proportion of (1 → 6)-linked α-D-glucose units to (1 → 3)-linked α-D-glucose
units was 94.3:5.7%. The FTIR analysis also confirmed the (1 → 6)-linked
α-D-glucose linkage. A high level of thermal stability was observed for glucan
MED17 as no degradation up to 300 °C was observed by TGA and DSC analysis. The
XRD analysis of glucan MED17 showed its semi- crystalline nature and its compact 
sheet-like morphology was observed by SEM analysis. Finally, antioxidant
characteristics of glucan MED17 were determined by ABTS and DPPH radical
scavenging activity tests that revealed a moderate antioxidant activity of glucan
MED17. These findings show potential techno-functional characteristics of glucan 
MED17.
