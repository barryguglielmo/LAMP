After extracting the oil from rapeseed, the remaining meal byproduct is used in
animal feed, particularly for cattle, and represents an effective, high-protein
substitute for soybean meal. The biotransformation of rapeseed meal using
Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) bacteria increases its nutritional value and 
enriches it with a variety of additives including polymers, biosurfactants, and
enzymes. Polymers produced in SSF process with rapeseed meal (e.g., levan) have
probiotic prosperities and can even serve as alternatives to antibiotics, which
are banned from animal feed by law. Due to their moisturizing properties, these
polymers are also incorporated into cosmetics. The biosurfactants produced by
bacteria and yeast confer their strong antimicrobial effects to preserve the
feed. In turn, the many enzymes produced during the biotransformation of rapeseed
meal increase its nutritional value by reducing fibers, detrimental substances
(e.g., tannins, erucic acid, phytic acid), and mycotoxins. Taken together,
rapeseed meal biotransformation results in numerous benefits, for the animal and 
industry alike.
