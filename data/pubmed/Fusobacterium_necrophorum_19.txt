Lemierre syndrome is a life-threatening condition associated with infection by
obligate anaerobes residing in oropharyngeal mucosa. The most common organism
responsible is Fusobacterium necrophorum. We report a case in a 69-year-old
gentleman. The man with past medical history of hypertension, anxiety and chronic
alcohol abuse was brought in by his family for altered mental status and fever.
He had a complicated stay with septic shock on multiple pressors, his blood
cultures grew Fusobacterium necrophorum and neck ultrasound showed acute thrombus
of the right internal jugular vein (IJV). The patient had received intravenous
antibiotics throughout stay but had poor prognosis and eventually expired after a
complicated hospital stay. Lemierre syndrome is a rare syndrome usually
associated with an acute oropharyngeal infection due to anaerobic bacteria
leading to secondary septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein. The
characteristic clinical picture noticed is a hematogenous progression to distant 
septic emboli. It is a life-threatening condition and a prompt diagnosis is
critical for preventing fatal consequences. The purpose of this case report is to
increase awareness about this clinical condition among medical professionals.
