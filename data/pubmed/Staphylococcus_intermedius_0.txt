Antibiotic resistance is a global problem, searching for new antimicrobial agents
is an urgent need. In this study, in vitro antibacterial and antimicrobial
effects of milk-derived antimicrobial agents, lactoferrin-derived peptides,
lactoferricin (Lfc) and lactoferrampin (Lfa) (alone or in combination) and their 
association with natural extracts have been explored. The assessment of
antimicrobial activity was based on two measurements: Minimum Inhibitory
Concentration and Fractional Inhibitory Concentration indexes. Lfc alone is more 
suitable for inhibiting Staphylococcus intermedius and Malassezia pachydermatis, 
while Lfa against Candida albicans, a synergistic effect of the two peptides
against all the three pathogens has been detected. A strong synergy of all the
natural extracts with Lfc and Lfa solution against selected microorganisms in
vitro was pointed out. Our results suggest that natural-derived compounds, such
as milk peptides and vegetal extracts could be promising tools to treat moderate 
fungal and bacterial infections.
