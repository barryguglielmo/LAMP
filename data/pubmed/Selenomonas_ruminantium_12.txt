Objective: An insufficient mineralization (hypomineralization) in the teeth
during the maturation stage of amelogenesis cause defects in 3-44% of children.
Here, we describe for the first time the microbiota associated with these defects
and compared it to healthy teeth within the same subjects. Methods: Supragingival
dental plaque was sampled from healthy and affected teeth from 25 children with
﻿molar-incisor hypomineralization (MIH). Total DNA was extracted and the 16S rRNA
gene was sequenced by Illumina sequencing in order to describe the bacterial
composition. Results: We detected a higher bacterial diversity in MIH samples,
suggesting better bacterial adhesion or higher number of niches in those
surfaces. We found the genera Catonella, Fusobacterium, Campylobacter,
Tannerella, Centipeda, Streptobacillus, Alloprevotella and Selenomonas associated
with hypomineralized teeth, whereas Rothia and Lautropia were associated with
healthy sites. Conclusion: The higher protein content of MIH-affected teeth could
favour colonization by proteolytic microorganisms. The over-representation of
bacteria associated with endodontic infections and periodontal pathologies
suggests that, in addition to promote caries development, MIH could increase the 
risk of other oral diseases.
