BACKGROUND AND AIM: We have previously shown that fecal microbial markers might
be useful for non-invasive diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) and adenoma.
Here, we assessed the application of microbial DNA markers, as compared with and 
in combination with fecal immunochemical test (FIT), in detecting CRC and adenoma
in symptomatic patients and asymptomatic subjects.
METHODS: We recruited 676 subjects [210 CRC, 115 advanced adenoma (AA), 86
non-advanced adenoma, and 265 non-neoplastic controls], including 241 symptomatic
and 435 asymptomatic subjects. Fecal abundances of Fusobacterium nucleatum, a
Lachnoclostridium sp. m3, Bacteroides clarus, and Clostridium hathewayi were
quantified by quantitative PCR. Combining score of the four microbial markers
(4Bac) and diagnostic prediction were determined using our previously established
scoring model and cutoff values and FIT with a cutoff of 100 ng Hb/mL.
RESULTS: 4Bac detected similar percentages of CRC [85.3% (95%CI: 79.2-90.2%) vs
84.9% (68.1-94.9%)] and AA [35.7% (12.8-64.9%) vs 38.6% (29.1-48.8%)], while FIT 
detected more CRC [72.1% (63.7-79.4%) vs 66.7% (48.2-82.0%)] and AA [28.6%
(8.4-58.1%) vs 16.8% (10.1-25.6%)], in symptomatic vs asymptomatic subjects,
respectively. Focusing on the asymptomatic cohort, 4Bac was more sensitive for
diagnosing CRC and AA than FIT (P < 0.001), with lower specificity [83.3%
(77.6-88.0%) vs 98.6% (96.0-99.7%)]. FIT failed to detect any non-advanced
adenoma [0% (0.0-4.2%)] compared with 4Bac [41.9% (31.3-53.0%), P < 0.0001].
Combining 4Bac with FIT improved sensitivities for CRC [90.9% (75.7-98.1%)] and
AA [48.5% (38.4-58.7%)] detection.
CONCLUSION: Quantitation of fecal microbial DNA markers may serve as a new test, 
stand alone, or in combination with FIT for screening colorectal neoplasm in
asymptomatic subjects.
