Food allergy is a life-threatening response to specific foods, and microbiota
imbalance (dysbiosis) in gut is considered a cause of this disease. Meanwhile,
the host immune response also plays an important role in the disease. Notably,
interleukin 33 (IL-33) released from damaged or necrotic intestinal epithelial
cells facilitates IL-2-producing CD4 helper T (Th2) responses. However, causal
relationships between the gut and oral dysbiosis and food allergy remain unknown.
In this study, we analyzed effects of gut and oral dysbiosis on development of
food allergy. A murine model of food allergy was established via ovalbumin (OVA) 
injection in BALB/c mice. Viable fecal bacteria were identified using
matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry
(MALDI-TOF MS). il33 expression in colon-26 mouse colon cells stimulated by
isolated fecal bacteria was quantified by real-time PCR. Intestinal T cells from 
the mice were analyzed by flow cytometry. Salivary IgA levels were quantified by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and IgA-bound oral bacteria were
detected by flow cytometry. Among fecal bacteria, the abundance of Citrobacter
sp. increased in the feces of allergic mice and induced il33 expression in
colon-26 cells. Orally administered Citrobacter koseri JCM1658 exacerbated
systemic allergic symptoms and reduced intestinal Th17 cells. Salivary IgA and
IgA-bound oral bacteria increased in the allergic mice. Based on the results
described above, food allergy induced both gut and oral dysbiosis. Citrobacter
sp. aggravated allergy symptoms by inducing IL-33 release from intestinal
epithelial cells.
