Genome changes are central to the adaptation of bacteria, especially under
antibiotic pressure. The aim of this study was to report phenotypic and genomic
adaptations undergone by an Enterobacter hormaechei clinical strain that became
highly resistant to key antimicrobials during a 4-month period in a patient
hospitalized in an intensive care unit (ICU). All six clinical E. hormaechei
strains isolated in one ICU-hospitalized patient have been studied. MICs
regarding 17 antimicrobial molecules have been measured. Single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) were determined on the sequenced genomes. The expression of 
genes involved in antibiotic resistance among Enterobacter cloacae complex
strains were determined by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). All 
the strains belonged to sequence type 66 and were distant by a maximum of nine
SNPs. After 3 months of hospitalization, three strains presented a significant
increase in MICs for ceftazidime, cefepime, temocillin, ertapenem, tigecycline,
ciprofloxacin, and chloramphenicol. Those resistant strains did not acquire
additional antibiotic resistance genes but harbored a 16-bp deletion in the ramR 
gene. This deletion led to upregulated expression of RamA, AcrA, AcrB, and TolC
and downregulated expression of OmpF. The ΔramR mutant harbored the same
phenotype as the resistant clinical strains regarding tigecycline,
chloramphenicol, and ciprofloxacin. The increased expression of RamA due to
partial deletion in the ramR gene led to a cross-resistance phenotype by an
increase of antibiotic efflux through the AcrAB-TolC pump and a decrease of
antibiotic permeability by porin OmpF. ramR appears to be an important adaptative
trait for E. hormaechei strains.
