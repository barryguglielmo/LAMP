Fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols
(FODMAPs) trigger symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Fructan degradation
during bread making reduces FODMAPs in bread while maintaining the content of
dietary fiber. This study explored the presence of the fructanases FruA in
lactobacilli and characterized its use in bread making. FruA was exclusively
present in vertebrate-adapted lactobacilli. In Lactobacillus crispatus DSM29598, 
FruA was located in cell wall fractions and includes a SLAP domain. FruA
hydrolyzed levan or inulin; expression of fruA was not subject to catabolite
repression. Fructans in bread were reduced by less than 50% in a straight dough
process; conventional sourdough fermentation reduced fructans in bread by 65-70%.
Sourdough fermentation with L. crispatus reduced fructans in bread by more than
90%. In conclusion, reduction of FODMAP by sourdough fermentation may improve
tolerance in many IBS patients. Fermentation with FruA-expressing L. crispatus
DSM29598 produces a low FODMAP bread.
