Introduction: Turicella otitidis, described as a new species over 20 years ago,
has been isolated mainly from the external ear canal and middle ear fluid. Here, 
we report the first case of palmoplantar eczema related to T. otitidis.
Case presentation: Here, we report the first case of palmoplantar eczema in a
74-year-old female related to T. otitidis.
Conclusions: The question as to whether T. otitidis is a potential pathogen in
cases of dyshidrotic eczema is still open, but this could be better elucidated if
corynebacteria were speciated more often.
LEARNING POINTS: The coryneform bacteria Turicella otitidis and Corynebacterium
auris were recently detected for the first time in the middle ear of patients
with acute otitis media and chronic otitis media.T. otitidis is a potential
extraotic pathogen.T. otitidis may be implicated in the pathogenesis of
palmoplantar dermatitis.
