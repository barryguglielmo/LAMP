OBJECTIVES: To investigate symptoms of infections and their risk factors among
French medical students undertaking an internship abroad.
METHODS: Clinical follow up, and qPCR-based respiratory, gastrointestinal, and
vaginal pathogen carriages were prospectively assessed pre-travel and
post-travel, in a cohort of medical students departing from Marseille, France.
RESULTS: 293 students were included. 63.5%, 35.8%, and 3.6% of students reported 
gastrointestinal, respiratory, and vaginal symptoms, respectively. The
acquisition rate of Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli and Enteropathogenic E.
coli was 40.9% and 18.6%, respectively. A significant increase was observed for
rhinovirus and Streptococcus pneumoniae by comparing the prevalence of pathogens 
in pre-travel and post-travel samples. Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium
vaginae acquisition rates were 12.9% and 13.9%, respectively. Being female,
primarily traveling to Vietnam, and living in basic accommodation conditions were
independent risk factors for reporting respiratory symptoms. Students reporting
respiratory symptoms were three times more likely to acquire S. pneumoniae.
Traveling primarily to north India and Senegal were independent risk factors for 
diarrhea.
CONCLUSION: This study makes it possible to identify the leading infectious
diseases linked to travel in a group of French medical students undertaking an
internship abroad and the risk factors on which to base targeting students for
reinforced pre-travel advice.
