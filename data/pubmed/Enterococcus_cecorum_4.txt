OBJECTIVE: As laying hens become aged, laying performance and egg quality are
generally impaired. One of the practical methods to rejuvenate production and egg
quality of aged laying hens with decreasing productivity is a forced molting.
However, the changes in intestinal microbiota after forced molting of aged hens
are not clearly known. The aim of the present study was to analyze the changes in
excreta bacterial communities after forced molting of aged laying hens.
METHODS: A total of one hundred 66-wk-old Hy-Line Brown laying hens were induced 
to molt by a 2-d water removal and an 11-d fasting until egg production
completely ceased. The excreta samples of 16 hens with similar body weight were
collected before and immediately after molting. Excreta bacterial communities
were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes.
RESULTS: Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria were the three major
bacterial phyla in pre-molting and immediate post-molting hens, accounting for
more than 98.0%. Lactobacillus genus had relatively high abundance in both group,
but decreased by molting (62.3% in pre-molting and 24.9% in post-molting hens).
Moreover, pathogenic bacteria such as Enterococcus cecorum and Escherichia coli
were more abundant in immediate post-molting hens than in pre-molting hens.
Forced molting influenced the alpha diversity, with higher Chao1 (p = 0.012),
phylogenetic diversity whole tree (p = 0.014), observed operational taxonomic
unit indices (p = 0.006), and Simpson indices (p<0.001), which indicated that
forced molting increased excreta bacterial richness of aged laying hens.
CONCLUSION: This study improves the current knowledge of bacterial community
alterations in the excreta by forced molting in aged laying hens, which can
provide increasing opportunity to develop novel dietary and management skills for
improving the gastrointestinal health of aged laying hens after molting.
