Heterotrophic system for carbon sequestration is gaining importance in the recent
decades. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) is a major enzyme involved in carbon
sequestration and biomineralization process. In this paper, we evaluate the
effect of pesticide on CA activity using inhibitory assay. 2,4-D, being one of
the most extensively used pesticide, being deleterious to soil health, its usage 
should be minimized to regain the soil health. Maximum inhibitory constant (Ki)
was observed for 5% 2,4-D (49.53 mM) followed by 5% glyphosate (43.92 mM). The
maximum Km increase with increase in pesticide concentration by 3.05-fold was in 
case of glyphosate which was higher than that of 2,4-D (2.08-fold) and dichlorvos
(2.38-fold). Moreover, we evaluated the carbon sequestration using CA enzyme in
the soil microcosm. In the present study, we identified the negative impact of
2,4-D on carbonic anhydrase produced by Bacillus halodurans PO15. The inhibition 
was a mixed type and had significantly lowered the carbon reduction to about 2.38
Â± 0.17% in a soil microcosm study. Based on the molecular docking, the inhibition
was contributed due to weak H-bonding interaction with amino acid residues
(Gly65, Gly95, Val147, Ser150 and Gly65, Ser146, and Ser150).
