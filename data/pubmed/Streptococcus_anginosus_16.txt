PURPOSE: We evaluate the prevalent microorganisms, antibiotic sensitivity
patterns and associated outcomes in patients with Fournier's gangrene.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients with Fournier's
gangrene was conducted between October 2011 and April 2018 at our institution.
Univariate analysis was performed using independent t-test or Kruskal-Wallis H
test for continuous variables and exact test for categorical variables.
RESULTS: Of the 143 patients included in this study,wound culture was available
in 131 (92%) patients with a median number of 3 microorganisms per wound. The
most commonly grown pathogens were Staphylococcus species (66, 46%),
Streptococcus species (53, 37%), Bacteroides species (34, 24%), Candida species
(31, 22%), Escherichia coli (28, 20%) and Prevotella species (26, 18%). Most
bacteria were sensitive to ampicillin-sulbactam, ceftriaxone,
piperacillin-tazobactam, amikacin and cefepime, and resistant to ampicillin,
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, levofloxacin and clindamycin. Enterococcus
faecalis and Streptococcus anginosus were resistant to vancomycin. The overall
Fournier's gangrene mortality count was 14 (10%) patients. No association was
noted between the type of infection and Fournier's gangrene severity index,
length of hospital stay or mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: At our institution Candida is a prevalent pathogen in the wound
culture of patients with Fournier's gangrene. The resistance patterns for
clindamycin and vancomycin are concerning. Addition of an antifungal agent to the
empiric treatment should be considered based on clinical presentation.
