Background: A number of episodes of nosocomial Agrobacterium spp. bacteremia (two
cases per year) were observed at Bern University Hospital, Switzerland, from 2015
to 2017. This triggered an outbreak investigation.
Methods: Cases of Agrobacterium spp. bacteremias that occurred between August
2011 and February 2017 were investigated employing line lists, environmental
sampling, rapid protein- (MALDI-TOF MS), and genome-based typing (pulsed field
gel electrophoresis and whole genome sequencing) of the clinical isolates.
Results: We describe a total of eight bacteremia episodes due to A. radiobacter
(n = 2), Agrobacterium genomovar G3 (n = 5) and A. pusense (n = 1). Two tight
clusters were observed by WGS typing, representing the two A. radiobacter
isolates (cluster I, isolated in 2015) and four of the Agrobacterium genomovar G3
isolates (cluster II, isolated in 2016 and 2017), suggesting two different point 
sources. The epidemiological investigations revealed two computer tomography (CT)
rooms as common patient locations, which correlated with the two outbreak
clusters. MALDI-TOF MS permitted faster evaluation of strain relatedness than
DNA-based methods. High resolution WGS-based typing confirmed the MALDI-TOF MS
clustering.
Conclusions: We report clinical and epidemiological characteristics of two
outbreak clusters with Agrobacterium. spp. bacteremia likely acquired during CT
contrast medium injection and highlight the use of MALDI-TOF MS as a rapid tool
to assess relatedness of rare gram-negative pathogens in an outbreak
investigation.
