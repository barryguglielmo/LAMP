This commentary explains the reasons for the extensive variations in pneumococcal
penicillin resistance based on a literature review of pneumococcal
penicillin-binding proteins, the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of
beta-lactams, the risk factors associated with mortality, laboratory issues and
challenges, including identification, susceptibility testing, and clinical
reporting, and the management of invasive and noninvasive Streptococcus
pneumoniae infections.
