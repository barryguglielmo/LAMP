Black soldier fly (BSF) is used for the management of organic waste, but research
has hardly explored the effect of companion bacteria when chicken manure (CHM) is
converted to insect biomass. In this study, we isolated nine bacterial species
(FE01, FE02, FE03, FE04, FE05, FE06, FE07, FE08, FE09) from BSF eggs and one
(BSF-CL) from the larval gut. These companion bacteria were inoculated into CHM
along with BSF larvae (BSFL). Larval growth and manure conversion rates were
determined. Results indicated that almost all bacteria individual bacteria in
this study significantly promote BSFL growth. BSFL reared in manure with the
species Kocuria marina (FE01), Lysinibacillus boronitolerans (FE04), Proteus
mirabilis (FE08) and Bacillus subtilis (BSF-CL) had higher weight gain and manure
reduction rates compared to the control. These four strains used were then
examined as a poly-bacteria community experiment to determine BSFL growth and
manure conversion. Manure inoculated with the poly-bacteria Group3
(FE01:FE04:FE08:BSF-CL = 4:1:1:1) and then fed to BSFL resulted in 28.6% more
weight gain than the control. The greatest manure reduction rate (52.91%) was
reached when companion bacteria were mixed at a ratio of 1:1:1:4. Additionally,
the companion bacteria influenced the nutritional value of BSFL. Crude protein
content in Group1 (FE01:FE04:FE08:BSF-CL = 1:1:1:1) was significantly larger than
that of the control. Crude fat content in Group3 was significantly larger than
that of the control. BSFL companion bacteria and their poly-bacteria compound
improved manure conversion efficiency and nutrient accumulation in BSFL, reduced 
CHM quantity, increased larvae biomass, with potential economic gains in CHM
management.
