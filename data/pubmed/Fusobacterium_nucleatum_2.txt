Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) is frequently found in colorectal cancers (CRCs).
High loads of Fn DNA are detected in CRC tissues with microsatellite
instability-high (MSI-H), or with the CpG island hypermethylation phenotype
(CIMP). Fn infection is also associated with the inflammatory tumor
microenvironment of CRC. A subtype of CRC exhibits inflammation-associated
microsatellite alterations (IAMA), which are characterized by microsatellite
instability-low (MSI-L) and/or an elevated level of microsatellite alterations at
selected tetra-nucleotide repeats (EMAST). Here we describe two independent CRC
cohorts in which heavy or moderate loads of Fn DNA are associated with MSI-H and 
L/E CRC respectively. We also show evidence that Fn produces factors that induce 
γ-H2AX, a hallmark of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), in the infected cells.
