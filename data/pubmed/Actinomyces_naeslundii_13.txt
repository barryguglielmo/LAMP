PURPOSE: Black extrinsic discoloration is a common clinical and aesthetic
problem. This study aims to evaluate the potential in vitro antagonistic activity
of two commercial probiotics, Streptococcus salivarius M18 and Lactobacillus
reuteri ProDentis, against microorganisms associated with black stains.
METHODS: Streptococcus salivarius M18 and Lactobacillus reuteri were tested
against Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Actinomyces naeslundiiusing
their cell-free fermentative broth in a planktonic growth inhibition test.
RESULTS: Both probiotic cell-free supernatants showed the ability to reduce the
pathogenic bacteria growth in a dose-dependent way. Streptococcus salivarius M18 
showed a stronger antimicrobial activity than Lactobacillus reuteri ProDentis
against the two indicator strains used. A. naeslundi was less susceptible to the 
probiotic activity of both S. salivarius and L. reuteri compared to A.
actinomycetemcomitans.
CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results demonstrate a potent antagonistic ability of
probiotics to reduce the growth of microorganisms associated with black tooth
stains. Therefore, these strains could be evaluated for a therapeutic use against
dental pigmentations.
