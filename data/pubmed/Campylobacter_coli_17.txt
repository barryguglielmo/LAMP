The study investigates the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in
Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli in gastroenteritis patients in the
eight most populous regions in Australia and compares the prevalence of
antimicrobial resistance in Europe and North America. A total of 164
Campylobacter isolates were collected from patients with campylobacteriosis and
tested for susceptibility to six antimicrobials using ETESTÂ® strips and compared 
with reports from Europe and the United States. Genomes were sequenced on
Illumina NextSeq to identify genetic determinants of resistance. Phenotypically, 
1.8%, 14.0%, 14.6%, and 20.1% of isolates were resistant to erythromycin (ERY),
ampicillin, tetracycline (TET), and ciprofloxacin (CIP), respectively. Comparing 
published phenotypic results of antimicrobial resistance in several European
countries and the United States with these Australian isolates reveals that rates
observed in Australia are among the lowest observed for ERY, CIP, and TET for
both C. coli and C. jejuni. For each antimicrobial tested, concordance between
resistance phenotype and genotype ranged from 66.6% to 100.0%. This study
highlights that, among industrialized countries, Portugal and Spain have very
high levels of antimicrobial resistance in C. jejuni and C. coli, especially when
compared with the United Kingdom, United States, and Australia.
