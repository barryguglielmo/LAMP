A 79-year-old man with liver failure, hypertension and hyperlipidemia presented
with a 1.5-month history of progressive nasal crusting and pain on the inside of 
the nose, advancing into a necrotic columella and philtrum. On rigid endoscopy,
debris extended to middle and inferior turbinate to midway posteriorly. Initial
culture swabs and CT were negative. The patient underwent endoscopic biopsy of
the lesion, with histopathological findings revealing abundant acute inflammation
and minute fragments of atypical squamous epithelium, favouring reactive atypia. 
Non-invasive fungal hyphae were identified. Bacterial cultures revealed
Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium accolens, Curvularia species and
Pseudomonas putida A current literature search failed to find other published
cases of P. putida nasal infections. P. putida is generally difficult to isolate 
on swab culture as the surrounding tissue is necrosed; this case highlights the
importance of reconsidering bacterial infection and obtaining a tissue biopsy in 
the case of non-healing necrotic-appearing tissue with negative culture swab and 
CT without evidence of mass.
