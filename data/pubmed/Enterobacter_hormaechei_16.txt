Bacterial capsules and lipopolysaccharides are diverse surface polysaccharides
(SPs) that serve as the frontline for interactions with the outside world. While 
SPs can evolve rapidly, their diversity and evolutionary dynamics across
different taxonomic scales has not been investigated in detail. Here, we focused 
on the bacterial order Enterobacteriales (including the medically relevant
Enterobacteriaceae), to carry out comparative genomics of two SP locus synthesis 
regions, cps and kps, using 27,334 genomes from 45 genera. We identified
high-quality cps loci in 22 genera and kps in 11 genera, around 4% of which were 
detected in multiple species. We found SP loci to be highly dynamic genetic
entities: their evolution was driven by high rates of horizontal gene transfer
(HGT), both of whole loci and component genes, and relaxed purifying selection,
yielding large repertoires of SP diversity. In spite of that, we found the
presence of (near-)identical locus structures in distant taxonomic backgrounds
that could not be explained by recent exchange, pointing to long-term selective
preservation of locus structures in some populations. Our results reveal
differences in evolutionary dynamics driving SP diversity within different
bacterial species, with lineages of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter hormaechei and
Klebsiella aerogenes most likely to share SP loci via recent exchange; and
lineages of Salmonella enterica, Citrobacter sakazakii and Serratia marcescens
most likely to share SP loci via other mechanisms such as long-term preservation.
Overall, the evolution of SP loci in Enterobacteriales is driven by a range of
evolutionary forces and their dynamics and relative importance varies between
different species.
