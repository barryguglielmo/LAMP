Different bacterial isolates with amylolytic activity were insulated from various
honey samples. The most active isolate was identified by the molecular 16SrRNA
sequence technique as Bacillus atrophaeus NRC1. The bacterium showed maximum
amylase production under optimum culture conditions at pH 6.0, 40 °C and after
24 h incubation. Two amylase isoenzymes (AmyI and AmyII) from Bacillus atrophaeus
NRC1 have been purified to homogeneity by using ammonium sulfate precipitation,
Sephacryl S-200 and DEAE-Sepharose chromatography. The major isoenzyme, AmyI, had
a specific activity 4635 U/mg proteins with molecular weight of 61 kDa using
SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. The maximum activity of AmyI against starch was
determined at pH 6.0 and 50 °C. AmyI was stable up to 50 °C after incubation for 
30 min, retained 65 and 23% of its activity at 60 and 70 °C, respectively.
Pre-incubation with Ca2+, Mg2+ and Ba2+ cations for 30 min enhanced the enzyme
activity; while it was completely inhibited by Hg2+. Varied inhibition degree of 
the enzyme activity was determined with K+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Na2+ and Cu2+ ions. AmyI 
was inhibited by EDTA, PMSF and SDS, while it was activated by l-Cysteine-HCl and
DTT. AmyI had the ability to degrade starch, amylopectin, glycogen, amylose and
lacked the affinity towards β-1,4-linked xyloses.
