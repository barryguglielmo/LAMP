Evidence is mounting that the gut-brain axis plays an important role in mental
diseases fueling mechanistic investigations to provide a basis for future
targeted interventions. However, shotgun metagenomic data from treatment-naïve
patients are scarce hampering comprehensive analyses of the complex interaction
between the gut microbiota and the brain. Here we explore the fecal microbiome
based on 90 medication-free schizophrenia patients and 81 controls and identify a
microbial species classifier distinguishing patients from controls with an area
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.896, and replicate
the microbiome-based disease classifier in 45 patients and 45 controls
(AUC = 0.765). Functional potentials associated with schizophrenia include
differences in short-chain fatty acids synthesis, tryptophan metabolism, and
synthesis/degradation of neurotransmitters. Transplantation of a
schizophrenia-enriched bacterium, Streptococcus vestibularis, appear to induces
deficits in social behaviors, and alters neurotransmitter levels in peripheral
tissues in recipient mice. Our findings provide new leads for further
investigations in cohort studies and animal models.
