: Enterobacter ludwigii is a fermentative Gram-negative environmental species and
accidental human pathogen that belongs to the Enterobacter cloacae complex with
the general characteristics of the genus Enterobacter. The clinical isolate E.
ludwigii CEB04 was derived from a urinary tract catheter of an individual not
suffering from catheter-associated urinary tract infection. The draft genome
sequence of the high biofilm forming E. ludwigii CEB04 was determined by PacBio
sequencing. The chromosome of E. ludwigii CEB04 is comprised of one contig of
4,892,375 bps containing 4596 predicted protein-coding genes and 120 noncoding
RNAs. E. ludwigii CEB04 harbors several antimicrobial resistance markers and has 
an extended cyclic-di-GMP signaling network compared to Escherichia coli K-12.
