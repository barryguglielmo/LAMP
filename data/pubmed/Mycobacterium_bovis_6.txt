Mycobacterium bovis AF2122/97 is the reference strain for the bovine tuberculosis
bacillus. Here we report an update to the M. bovis AF2122/97 genome annotation to
reflect 616 new protein identifications that replace many of the old hypothetical
coding sequences and proteins of unknown function in the genome. These changes
integrate information from functional assignments of orthologous coding sequences
in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv genome. We have also added 69 additional 
new gene names.
