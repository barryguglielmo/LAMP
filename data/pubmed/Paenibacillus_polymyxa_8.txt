Members of the genus Paenibacillus are known for their production of useful
substances, and some species of the genus are recognized to be plant
growth-promoting rhizobacteria. Paenibacillus polymyxa TH2H2, isolated from a
tomato flower, had antifungal activity. Here, the draft genome sequence of
Paenibacillus polymyxa TH2H2 is reported. The 5,983,104-bp genome, with a G+C
content of 45.31%, comprised 5,221 protein-coding genes, 64 ribosomal RNA and 100
transfer RNA. Three intact antibiotic biosynthesis gene clusters were identified 
using antiSMASH. These encoded the antifungal agent fusaricidin and two
antibacterial agents, tridecaptin and polymyxin. Sequence data have been
deposited in the DDBJ/ENA/GenBank database under the accession number
RPDG01000000. The version described in this paper is RPDG00000000.1. The
BioProject ID in the GenBank database is PRJNA505713.
