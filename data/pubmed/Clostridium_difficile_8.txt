Background: Based on MLST analyses the global population of C. difficile is
distributed in eight clades, of which Clade 2 includes the "hypervirulent"
NAP1/RT027/ST01 strain along with various unexplored sequence types (STs).
Methods: To clarify whether this clinically relevant phenotype is a widespread
feature of C. difficile Clade 2, we used the murine ileal loop model to compare
the in vivo pro-inflammatory (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) and oxidative stress activities
(MPO) of five Clade 2 clinical C. difficile isolates from sequence types (STs)
01, 41, 67, and 252. Besides, we infected Golden Syrian hamsters with spores from
these strains to determine their lethality, and obtain a histological evaluation 
of tissue damage, WBC counts, and serum injury biomarkers (LDH, ALT, AST,
albumin, BUN, creatinine, Na+, and Cl-). Genomic distances were calculated using 
Mash and FastANI to explore whether the responses were dictated by phylogeny.
Results: The ST01 isolate tested ranked first in all assays, as it induced the
highest overall levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, MPO activity, epithelial
damage, biochemical markers, and mortality measured in both animal models.
Statistically indistinguishable or rather similar outputs were obtained for a
ST67 isolate in tests such as tissue damage, neutrophils count, and lethal
activity. The results recorded for the two ST41 isolates tested were of
intermediate magnitude and the ST252 isolate displayed the lowest pathogenic
potential in all animal experiments. This ordering matched the genomic distance
of the ST01 isolate to the non-ST01 isolates.
Conclusions: Despite their close phylogenic relatedness, our results demonstrate 
differences in pathogenicity and virulence levels in Clade 2 C. difficile
strains, confirm the high severity of infections caused by the NAP1/RT027/ST01
strain, and highlight the importance of C. difficile typing.
