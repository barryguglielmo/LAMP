A 49-year-old male HIV positive patient on treatment failure presented with
complaints of fever and dysphagia of three weeks duration and later on developed 
cervical lymphadenopathy along with severe vomiting and abdominal pain. Liver
function tests were found to be worsening with severe drop in CD4 counts. An
extensive workup for pyrexia was done. FNAC and biopsy of lymph node showed
features suggestive of granulomatous lymphadenitis. CBNAAT of the lymph node
aspirate was negative for MTB. Blood culture and lymph node cultures were
negative for Mycobacterium Avium Complex (MAC). MAC was however, finally detected
and reported positive on Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) of the
cervical lymph node aspirate. Prompt treatment for MAC was initiated with
Ethambutol 800 mg OD and Azithromycin 500 mg OD following which fever spikes
subsided and lymph node resolved. The Patient's condition gradually improved and 
was discharged shortly with a good recovery on subsequent follow ups. Fever is
one of the common symptoms in patients with MAC infection. Some other clinical
manifestations include weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly and intra-abdominal
lymphadenopathy. Diagnostic evaluation should be aggressive. As there is a high
risk for MAC infection in advanced HIV cases with poor HAART compliance, FISH can
be a valuable and effective diagnostic tool in early detection and treatment of
MAC.
