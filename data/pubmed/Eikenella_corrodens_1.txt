Vertebral osteomyelitis is an uncommon variant of osteomyelitis. Although
Staphylococcus and/or Streptococcus are commonly associated, alternate pathogens 
have been implicated in vertebral osteomyelitis, especially in endemic areas
and/or immunocompromised patients. Here, we present a case of a young African
American female with type I diabetes mellitus who presented to us with worsening 
back pain. The MRI lumbar spine was suggestive of vertebral osteomyelitis
involving the right facet joint of the fifth lumbar (L5) and the first spinal
(S1) joint and a significant narrowing of the thecal sac at the L4-L5 vertebral
level with an anterior epidural abscess. The patient was started on empirical
antibiotics, and surgical intervention was performed with L4-L5 laminectomy and
extraction of the epidural abscess. Her pus culture showed Eikenella corrodens as
a possible cause of vertebral osteomyelitis. She had an uneventful recovery after
two weeks of antibiotics (intravenous ceftriaxone) therapy.
