BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Periodontitis is an oral chronic inflammatory disease
caused by dental plaque. It is comorbid with numerous systemic diseases and
associated with several predisposing factors, such as chronic kidney disease
(CKD). Peritoneal dialysis is one of the ultimate treatments for patients with
severe CKD. However, peritoneal dialysis patients with periodontitis often will
be accompanied with more poor oral hygiene and periodontal clinical indexes. This
study aimed to compare the microbial flora of periodontitis patients with or
without peritoneal dialysis.
METHODS: Sixteen peritoneal dialysis patients with periodontitis (P group) and 16
patients with periodontitis only (C group) were selected. Subgingival plaque
samples of them were processed for bioinformatics analysis by 16S rDNA gene
sequencing.
RESULTS: The diversity indices and species richness in the P group were
insignificantly higher than that in the C group (P > 0.05). The two groups
exhibited different microbial community structure. At Genus level,
Prevotellaceae, Selenomonas, Aggregatibacter, Anaeroglobus, TM7_[G-5], and
Centipeda were significantly enriched in the P group than those in the C group.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that specific microbes enriched in the
subgingival flora of peritoneal dialysis patients with periodontitis.
