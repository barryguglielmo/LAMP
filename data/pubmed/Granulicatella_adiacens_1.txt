Background: Granulicatella adiacens is a nutritional variant of streptococcus
(NVS), which has been rarely reported as an etiologic agent in spondylodiscitis
(SD).
Material and methods: We report a case of a 51-year-old male with from chronic
low-back pain associated with right sciatica and ipsilateral monoparesis. Spinal 
MRI showed radiological signs on L1-L2 and L5-S1 discs consistent with SD. We
also performed a systematic review of the pertinent literature in order to
retrieve all the key information regarding microbiological and clinical features.
Results: Including our patients, seven cases with a mean age 56 ± 10.2 years were
reported in English literature. Six patients were conservatively managed with
antibiotic therapy (66%), whereas three with surgery in combination with
antibiotics (33%). An endocarditis was associated in three cases, and a pacemaker
infection in one. All patients received targeted antibiotic therapy resulting in 
a quick improvement of clinical symptoms with favorable outcome. Our case is the 
only with a skip spontaneous SD, which needed a surgical decompression due to the
associated neurological symptoms.
Conclusions: This incidence of SD sustained by Granulicatella adiances could be
underestimated due to their particular microbiological conditions requested for
their cultures. However, this infection should be suspected in cases of
culture-negative SD, especially when associated with endocarditis.
