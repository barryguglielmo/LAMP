In patients with metastatic cancer, gut microbiome composition differs between
responder and non-responders to immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, there is
little consensus on the microbiome taxa associated with response or lack of
response. Additionally, recognized confounders of gut microbiome composition have
generally not been taken into account. In this study, metagenomic shotgun
sequencing was performed on freshly frozen pre-treatment stool samples from 25
patients (12 responders and 13 non-responders) with unresectable metastatic
melanoma treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. We observed no significant
differences in alpha-diversity and bacterial prevalence between responders and
non-responders (P > 0.05). In a zero-inflated multivariate analysis, correcting
for important confounders such as age, BMI and use of antibiotics, 68 taxa showed
differential abundance between responders and non-responders (false-discovery
rate < 0.05). Cox-regression analysis showed longer overall survival for carriers
of Streptococcus parasanguinis [hazard ratio (HR): 6.9] and longer
progression-free survival for carriers of Bacteroides massiliensis (HR: 3.79). In
contrast, carriership of Peptostreptococcaceae (unclassified species) was
associated with shorter overall survival (HR 0.18) and progression-free survival 
(HR 0.11). Finally, 17 microbial pathways differentially abundant between
responder and non-responders were observed. These results underline the
association between gut microbiome composition and response to immune checkpoint 
inhibitor therapy in a cohort of patients with cutaneous melanoma.
