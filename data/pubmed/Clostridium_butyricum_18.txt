BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the role of Clostridium butyricum (C.
butyricum) in conjunction with the Toll-like receptor2 (TLR2) signaling pathway
and T helper 17 (Th17) cells in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in
mice.
METHODS: Forty 8-week-old BALB/c mice were randomly divided into 5 groups of 8
mice for 7 days: control, DSS (5% DSS), DSS+C. butyricum (1 × 109 CFU), DSS+C.
butyricum (1 × 108 CFU) and DSS+C. butyricum (1 × 107 CFU) groups. We assessed
the disease activity index (DAI) and histological damage scores. The expression
levels of TLR2, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), nuclear factor kappa-B
p65 (NF-κBp65), interleukin (IL) 17 (IL17), IL23 and retineic acid receptor
related orphan nuclear receptor gamma t (RORγt) were determined through
immunohistochemical staining, western blot and quantitative real-time PCR
(qRT-PCR). The expression levels of CD3+CD4+IL17+ cells in peripheral blood were 
measured by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: C. butyricum dose-dependently decreased DAI and histological damage
scores in DSS mice and down-regulated the mRNA and protein levels of TLR2, MyD88 
and NF-κBp65 in mouse colon tissue (all P < 0.05). In addition, C. butyricum
dose-dependently decreased the levels of CD3+CD4+IL17+ cells in peripheral blood 
and down-regulated the mRNA and protein levels of IL17, IL23 and RORγt in mouse
colon tissue (all P < 0.05). Moreover, the effect of C. butyricum on TLR2 was
positively correlated with IL17, IL23 and RORγt.
CONCLUSIONS: C. butyricum exerts a dose-dependently protective effect on acute
intestinal inflammation induced by DSS in mice, by inhibiting the TLR2 signaling 
pathway, down-regulating the expression of IL23 and RORγt, and inhibiting the
secretion of IL17.
