Biosynthesis has emerged as an exciting interface for assembling multifunctional 
metal oxide nanoparticles for diverse medicinal applications. Herein, biogenic
nickel oxide (NiO-NPs) is synthesized by using floral extracts of Callistemon
viminalis (C. viminalis) as a low cost, ecofriendly reducing and stabilizing
agent. NiO-NPs were annealed at 300 °C, 400 °C and 500 °C while their
physiochemical properties were established by HR-SEM/TEM, UV, XRD, FTIR, EDS,
SAED and SQUID techniques. Particle size of NiO-NPs decreased with increase in
annealing temperatures. Magnetization curves indicated superparamagnetic behavior
of the biogenic NiO-NPs at 300 K. Highly crystalline NiO-NPs obtained after
annealing at 500 °C were used for biomedical applications. The anti-leishmanial
activity on Leishmania tropica promastigotes (KMH-23) and anticancer activity on 
HepG2 (RCB1648) revealed excellent inhibition potential with IC50 of 37.21 µg/mL 
and 47 µg/mL, respectively. Significant antibacterial effect was observed against
Klebsiella pneumonia and Proteus vulgaris with MIC's of 12.5 µg/mL each.
Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and α-glucosidase
inhibitory potential were comparable with positive control drugs. Moderate
antioxidant activities were observed. NiO-NPs were observed to be hemolytic (30%)
at higher dose (1000 µg/mL). Overall, NiO-NPs revealed a multifunctional nature
that can be explored for diverse biomedical applications.Communicated by
