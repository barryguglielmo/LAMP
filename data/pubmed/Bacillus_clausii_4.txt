Rotavirus is the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in young
children. Bacillus clausii (B. clausii) is a spore-forming probiotic that is able
to colonize the gut. A mixture of four B. clausii strains (O/C, T, SIN and N/R)
is commonly used for the treatment of AGE, and it has been demonstrated that it
can reduce the duration and severity of diarrhea in children with AGE. Few
studies have sought to characterize the mechanisms responsible for such
beneficial effects. Intestinal effects of probiotics are likely to be
strain-specific. We conducted a series of in vitro experiments investigating the 
activities of this mixture of B. clausii strains on biomarkers of mucosal barrier
integrity and immune function in a cellular model of Rotavirus infection. B.
clausii protected enterocytes against Rotavirus-induced decrease in
trans-epithelial electrical resistance, and up-regulated expression of mucin 5AC 
and tight junction proteins (occludin and zonula occludens-1), all of which are
important for effective mucosal barrier function. B. clausii also inhibited
reactive oxygen species production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines
(interleukin-8 and interferon-β) in Rotavirus-infected cells, and down-regulated 
pro-inflammatory Toll-like receptor 3 pathway gene expression. Such mechanisms
likely contributed to the observed protective effects of B. clausii against
reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in Rotavirus-infected
enterocytes.
