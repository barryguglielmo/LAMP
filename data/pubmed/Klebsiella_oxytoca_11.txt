BACKGROUND: Whey is a major pollutant generated by the dairy industry. To
decrease environmental pollution caused by the industrial release of whey, new
prospects for its utilization need to be urgently explored. Here, we investigated
the possibility of using whey powder to produce 2,3-butanediol (BDO), an
important platform chemical.
RESULTS: Klebsiella oxytoca strain PDL-0 was selected because of its ability to
efficiently produce BDO from lactose, the major fermentable sugar in whey. After 
deleting genes pox, pta, frdA, ldhD, and pflB responding for the production of
by-products acetate, succinate, lactate, and formate, a recombinant strain K.
oxytoca PDL-K5 was constructed. Fed-batch fermentation using K. oxytoca PDL-K5
produced 74.9 g/L BDO with a productivity of 2.27 g/L/h and a yield of 0.43 g/g
from lactose. In addition, when whey powder was used as the substrate, 65.5 g/L
BDO was produced within 24 h with a productivity of 2.73 g/L/h and a yield of
0.44 g/g.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the efficiency of K. oxytoca PDL-0 for BDO
production from whey. Due to its non-pathogenicity and efficient lactose
utilization, K. oxytoca PDL-0 might also be used in the production of other
important chemicals using whey as the substrate.
