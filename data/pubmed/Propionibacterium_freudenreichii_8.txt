The genome of Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. freudenreichii T82, which has
a chromosome containing 2,585,340 nucleotides with 67.3% GC content
(guanine-cytosine content), is described in this paper. The total number of genes
is 2308, of which 2260 are protein-coding genes and 48 are RNA genes. According
to the genome analysis and the obtained results, the T82 strain can produce
various compounds such as propionic acid, trehalose, glycogen, and B group
vitamins (e.g., B6, B9, and B12). From protein-coding sequences (CDSs), genes
related to stress adaptation, biosynthesis, metabolism, transport, secretion, and
defense machinery were detected. In the genome of the T82 strain, sequences
corresponding to the CRISPR loci (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short
Palindromic Repeats), antibiotic resistance, and restriction-modification system 
were found.
