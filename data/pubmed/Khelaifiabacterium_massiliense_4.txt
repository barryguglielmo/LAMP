In this manuscript, we report, for the first time, the photoinactivation
evaluation of tetra-cationic porphyrins with peripheral Pt (II)-bpy complexes in 
the photodynamic inactivation (PDI) of rapidly growing mycobacterial strains
(RGM). Two different isomeric Pt (II)-porphyrins were synthetized and applied.
PDI experiments in the strains of Mycobacteroides abscessus subsp. Abscessus
(ATCC 19977), Mycolicibacterium fortuitum (ATCC 6841), Mycobacteroides abscessus 
subsp. Massiliense (ATCC 48898), and Mycolicibacterium smegmatis (ATCC 700084)
conducted with adequate concentration (without aggregation) of photosensitizers
(PS) under white-light illumination for 90 min showed that the most effective PS 
significantly reduced the concentration of viable mycobacteria. The present
results show that positively charged porphyrins at the meta position (3-PtTPyP)
are more efficient PS against M. abscessus, M. fortuitum, M. massiliense, and M. 
smegmatis. The effectiveness of the molecule as PS for PDI studies is also clear 
with mycobacteria, which is strongly related with the porphyrin peripheral charge
and coordination platinum (II) compounds and consequently their solubility in
physiological media. Tetra-cationic PS may be promising anti-mycobacterial PDI
agents with potential applications in medical clinical cases and bioremediation.
