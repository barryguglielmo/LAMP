The gut microbiota synthesize hundreds of molecules, many of which influence host
physiology. Among the most abundant metabolites are the secondary bile acids
deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA), which accumulate at
concentrations of around 500 μM and are known to block the growth of Clostridium 
difficile1, promote hepatocellular carcinoma2 and modulate host metabolism via
the G-protein-coupled receptor TGR5 (ref. 3). More broadly, DCA, LCA and their
derivatives are major components of the recirculating pool of bile acids4; the
size and composition of this pool are a target of therapies for primary biliary
cholangitis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Nonetheless, despite the clear
impact of DCA and LCA on host physiology, an incomplete knowledge of their
biosynthetic genes and a lack of genetic tools to enable modification of their
native microbial producers limit our ability to modulate secondary bile acid
levels in the host. Here we complete the pathway to DCA and LCA by assigning and 
characterizing enzymes for each of the steps in its reductive arm, revealing a
strategy in which the A-B rings of the steroid core are transiently converted
into an electron acceptor for two reductive steps carried out by Fe-S
flavoenzymes. Using anaerobic in vitro reconstitution, we establish that a set of
six enzymes is necessary and sufficient for the eight-step conversion of cholic
acid to DCA. We then engineer the pathway into Clostridium sporogenes, conferring
production of DCA and LCA on a nonproducing commensal and demonstrating that a
microbiome-derived pathway can be expressed and controlled heterologously. These 
data establish a complete pathway to two central components of the bile acid
pool.
