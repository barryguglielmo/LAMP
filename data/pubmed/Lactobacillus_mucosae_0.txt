Weaning is a stressful time for piglets, often leading to weight loss and is
associated with increased morbidity and mortality. A leading cause for these
post-weaning problems is enteric dysbiosis and methods to improve piglet health
at this crucial developmental stage are needed. This study aimed to determine
whether an enteric dysbiosis caused by weaning could be corrected via a faecal
microbiota transplantation (FMT) from healthy piglets from a previous wean. Two
or four focal piglets per litter were assigned to one of two treatments; FMT two 
days post weaning (n = 21; FMT) or a control which received saline two days post 
weaning (n = 21; CON). FMT consisted of homogenised donor faeces administered
orally at 3 mL/kg. Weaning occurred at 18 days of age and weights and faecal
samples were collected on days 18, 20, 24 and 35. 16S rRNA amplicon analysis was 
used to assess the faecal microbiota of piglets. FMT increased Shannon's
diversity post weaning (p < 0.001) and reduced the scratch score observed at 24
days of age (p < 0.001). The bacterial populations significantly differed in
composition at each taxonomic level. In FMT pigs, significant increases in
potentially pathogenic Escherichia coli were observed. However, increases in
beneficial bacteria Lactobacillus mucosae and genera Fibrobacteres and
Bacteroidetes were also observed in FMT treated animals. To our knowledge, this
is the first study to observe a significant effect on piglet faecal microbiota
following a single FMT administered post weaning. Therefore, FMT post weaning can
potentially alleviate enteric dysbiosis.
