Transaminase responsible for alienating prochiral ketone compound is applicable
to asymmetric synthesis of herbicide L-phosphinothricin (L-PPT). In this work,
the covalent immobilization of recombinant transaminase from Citrobacter koseri
(CkTA) was investigated on different epoxy resins. Using optimum ES-105 support, 
a higher immobilized activity was obtained via optimizing immobilization process 
in terms of enzyme loading, coupling time and initial PLP concentration.
Crucially, due to blocking unreacted epoxy groups on support surface with amino
acids, the reaction temperature of blocked immobilized biocatalyst was enhanced
from 37 to 57 °C. Its thermostability at 57 °C was also found to be superior to
that of free CkTA. The Km value was shifted from 36.75 mM of free CkTA to
39.87 mM of blocked immobilized biocatalyst, demonstrating that the affinity of
enzyme to the substrate has not been apparently altered. Accordingly, the
biocatalyst performed the consecutive synthesis of L-PPT for 11 cycles
(yields>91%) with retaining more than 91.13% of the initial activity. The
seemingly the highest reusability demonstrates this biocatalyst has prospective
for reducing the costs of consecutive synthesis of L-PPT with high conversion.
