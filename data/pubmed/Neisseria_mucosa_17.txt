OBJECTIVE: Gastrointestinal microbiota may be involved in Helicobacter
pylori-associated gastric cancer development. The aim of this study was to
explore the possible microbial mechanisms in gastric carcinogenesis and potential
dysbiosis arising from H. pylori infection.
DESIGN: Deep sequencing of the microbial 16S ribosomal RNA gene was used to
investigate alterations in paired gastric biopsies and stool samples in 58
subjects with successful and 57 subjects with failed anti-H. pylori treatment,
relative to 49 H. pylori negative subjects.
RESULTS: In H. pylori positive subjects, richness and Shannon indexes increased
significantly (both p<0.001) after successful eradication and showed no
difference to those of negative subjects (p=0.493 for richness and p=0.420 for
Shannon index). Differential taxa analysis identified 18 significantly altered
gastric genera after eradication. The combination of these genera into a
Microbial Dysbiosis Index revealed that the dysbiotic microbiota in H. pylori
positive mucosa was associated with advanced gastric lesions (chronic atrophic
gastritis and intestinal metaplasia/dysplasia) and could be reversed by
eradication. Strong coexcluding interactions between Helicobacter and
Fusobacterium, Neisseria, Prevotella, Veillonella, Rothia were found only in
advanced gastric lesion patients, and were absent in normal/superficial gastritis
group. Changes in faecal microbiota included increased Bifidobacterium after
successful H. pylori eradication and more upregulated drug-resistant functional
orthologs after failed treatment.
CONCLUSION: H. pylori infection contributes significantly to gastric microbial
dysbiosis that may be involved in carcinogenesis. Successful H. pylori
eradication potentially restores gastric microbiota to a similar status as found 
in uninfected individuals, and shows beneficial effects on gut microbiota.
