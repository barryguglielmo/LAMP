Coal dust from open-cast mines is a significant air pollutant; thus, dust
particles and toxins contained in the dust are a severe threat to human health
and ecosystems. Microbially induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) is a low-cost 
and environmentally friendly way to suppress coal dust. With high urease activity
and tolerance to coal dust, a bacterial strain, Staphylococcus succinus J3, was
isolated from soil in a mine area. Thus, in dust suppression experiments, we used
coal dust dominated by fine granule particles (100-250 Î¼m) from an open-cast
mine. Consequently, four factors were identified: initial bacterial biomass,
calcium concentration, urea concentration, and spraying frequency; we
investigated their effects on MICP as a dust suppression technique using
one-factor-at-a-time experiments. Maximum threshold broken wind speed (45.5 m
s-1) and pressure (912 kPa) were obtained under the following condition: OD600 = 
0.7, 40 mmol calcium, 6% (w/w) urea in the bonding solution which was sprayed
five times in 35 days. Pearson correlation analysis described that urea
concentration and spraying frequency both significantly positive correlations
with the threshold broken wind speed and pressure via Pearson analysis. When the 
coal dust suppression process was complete, scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy showed that a solidified layer of
calcareous precipitate had formed on the surface of the dust. These results
indicate that Staphylococcus succinus J3 has considerable potential for use in
MICP as a coal dust suppression technique.
