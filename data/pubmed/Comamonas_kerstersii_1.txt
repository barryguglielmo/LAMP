We report the first identification in Ecuador of the microorganism Comamonas
kerstersii, a strain isolates from a sample of fluid from the abdominal cavity
and identified by the technique of mass spectrometry MALDITOF. It was obtained
during the surgical act of a patient with the diagnosis of acute peritonitis,
secondary to a perforated appendicitis. This microorganism is considered a rare
pathogen. Even though the genus to which it belongs has a wide geographical
distribution, this pathogen is considered an opportunistic agent.
