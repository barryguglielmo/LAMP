Contamination of agricultural land with heavy metal is a serious biological and
environmental issue. Such threat can be challenged by exploring the plant
symbiotic microbes that can improve plant growth through phyto-hormones secretion
and chromate chelation. In the current study, chromate resistant rhizospheric
Staphylococcus arlettae strain MT4 was isolated from the rhizosphere of
Malvestrum tricuspadatum L. The strain showed potential to secrete phytohormones 
and plant growth promoting secondary metabolites under induced chromate stress,
making it a best suitable candidate in chromate stress alleviation. Moreover, the
rhizobacterium MT4 significantly promoted the net assimilation and relative
growth rate of sunflower grown in the presence of chromate (100 ppm). Chromate
stress alleviation strategy of MT4 strain was three-fold. MT4 alleviated chromate
stress and promoted the sunflower growth by suppressing the chromate intake by
the host, modulating phytohormones and strengthening of the host's antioxidant
system. The improved antioxidant system was confirmed by noticing lower ROS
accumulation and improved ROS scavenging, lower peroxidase activity and higher
accumulation of phenols and flavonoids.
