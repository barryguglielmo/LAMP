OBJECTIVES: Study the rifampicin resistance of Rhodococcus equi strains isolated 
from French horses over a 20-year period.
METHODS: Rifampicin susceptibility tested by disc diffusion and broth
macrodilution methods, rpoB gene sequencing and MLST were performed on 40 R. equi
strains, half of which were non-susceptible to rifampicin.
RESULTS: Consistency of results was observed between rifampicin susceptibility
testing and rpoB sequencing. The non-susceptible strains to rifampicin by disc
diffusion had a substitution at one of the sites, Asp516, His526, and Ser531,
frequently encountered and conferring rifampicin resistance. High-level
resistance was correlated with His526Asp or Ser531Leu substitutions; low-level
resistance was correlated with Asp516Tyr substitution, a novel substitution for
R. equi. The susceptible strains to rifampicin by disc diffusion showed no
substitution in the three sites, except for two strains carrying respectively the
His526Asn and Asp516Val substitutions (previously correlated with low-level
rifampicin resistance). Both strains were isolated from an animal where ten other
strains were also isolated and found to be non-susceptible to rifampicin by disc 
diffusion. MLST showed the presence of 10 STs (including the novel ST43) but no
association was observed with rifampicin resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that certain substitutions in RpoB are more
likely to confer high- or low-level rifampicin resistance, describes a new
substitution conferring rifampicin resistance in R. equi and suggests a
non-clonal dissemination of rifampicin resistant strains in France. The standard 
disc diffusion method may miss strains with a low-level rifampicin resistant
substitution; further studies are needed to remedy the absence of R.
equi-specific clinical breakpoints.
