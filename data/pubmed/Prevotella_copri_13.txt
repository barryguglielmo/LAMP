The gastrointestinal tract of humans and swine consist of a wide range of
bacteria which interact with hosts metabolism. Due to the differences in
co-evolution and co-adaptation, a large fraction of the gut microbiome is
host-specific. In this study, we evaluated the effect of close human-animal
interaction to the faecal metagenome and metabonome of swine, farmer and human
control. Three distinct clusters were observed based on T-RFLP-derived faecal
microbial composition. However, 16S-inferred faecal microbiota and metabolic
profiles showed that only human control was significantly different from the
swine (P < 0.05). The metabonome of farmers and human controls were highly
similar. Notably, higher trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and butyrate were detected
in human control and swine, respectively. The relative abundance of TMAO was
positively correlated with Prevotella copri. Overall, we compared and established
the relationship between the metabolites and microbiota composition of swine,
farmers and human control. Based on the data obtained, we deduced that long term 
occupational exposure to swine and farm environment had affected the gut
bacterial composition of farmers. Nonetheless, the effect was less prominent in
the metabolite profiles, suggesting the gut bacteria expressed high functional
plasticity and are therefore resilience to the level of community shift detected.
