Purpose: To characterize the genetic feature of a multi-drug-resistant Aeromonas 
caviae strain isolated from the diarrhea sample of a 45-year-old male patient
with acute diarrhea.
Materials and Methods: Whole-genome of the A. caviae strain SCAc2001 was
sequenced via the Illumina system, followed by a series of bioinformatic analyses
to describe the genetic feature.
Results: The ﻿genome sequence of A. caviae SCAc2001 was assembled into 340
scaffolds (305 of them were > 1000 bp in length and 4,487,370 bp in total) with
an average G+C content of 61.09%. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the A. caviae
SCAc2001 strain was highly similar to the A. caviae strain R25-2 and T25-39.
Resistome analysis identified that A. caviae SCAc2001 carried 13 antimicrobial
resistance genes, including β-lactams (bla KPC, bla CTX-M-14, bla TEM-1, bla
OXA-10, bla OXA-427, bla VEB-3 and bla MOX-6), aminoglycosides (aadA1),
fluoroquinolones (aac(6')-Ib-cr), phenicol resistance (catB3), sulfonamide
(sul1), trimethoprim (dfrA5) and colistin resistance (mcr-3.3).And also, A.
caviae ScAc2001 carried 54 putative virulence genes including the type IV pilus, 
fimbria, flagellarthe, and hemolysin A encoding genes, and 12 ﻿pathogen-﻿host
﻿interactions (PHI) genes. There were also ﻿four genomic islands and ﻿eight
prophages in the genome of A. caviae ScAc2001. ﻿In addition, A. caviae SCAc2001
also carried ﻿three secondary metabolism products coding clusters including
nonribosomal peptide synthetases (nrps), hserlactone and bacteriocin.
Conclusion: A. caviae ScAc2001 carrie﻿s many resistance genes, a variety of
virulence factors, PHI genes and ﻿four genomic islands and ﻿eight prophages,
which poses a severe threat to infectious diseases control strategies, diagnosis 
methods and clinical treatment.
