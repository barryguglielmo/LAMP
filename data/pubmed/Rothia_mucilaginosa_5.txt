We performed a retrospective study to determine the epidemiology of Rothia
mucilaginosa infections among pediatric cancer patients. Over 20 years, 37 cases 
were identified; 27% developed complications, but there was no infection-related 
mortality. All cases were successfully treated with vancomycin.
