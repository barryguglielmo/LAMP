Arcanobacterium haemolyticum is a gram-positive, facultative anaerobic, branching
bacillus.[1] The first cases ascribed to this pathogen were described in 1946 and
caused ulcerative skin lesions among American soldiers in the Pacific Islands.
Today, infections by A. haemolyticum are rare but most commonly cause pharyngitis
in adolescents and young adults or skin and soft-tissue infections in
immunocompromised populations. Though cases of systemic infections such as
meningitis or bacteremia are uncommon, A. haemolyticum should remain on the
differential to enable the early recognition, management, and treatment of
disease associated with the pathogen.[2]  The classic presentation of pharyngeal 
disease may commonly be mistaken for streptococcal infections. Patients present
with a sore throat, pharyngeal erythema, fever, exanthema, and swollen lymph
nodes. The natural history of the disease may be self-limiting or require
antibiotic treatment.[3]
