The effective interactions of nanomaterials with biological constituents play a
significant role in enhancing their biomedicinal properties. These interactions
can be efficiently enhanced by altering the surface properties of nanomaterials. 
In this study, we demonstrate the method of altering the surface properties of
ZrO2 nanoparticles (NPs) to enhance their antimicrobial properties. To do this,
the surfaces of the ZrO2 NPs prepared using a solvothermal method is
functionalized with glutamic acid, which is an α-amino acid containing both COO- 
and NH4 + ions. The binding of glutamic acid (GA) on the surface of ZrO2 was
confirmed by UV-visible and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies, whereas
the phase and morphology of resulting GA-functionalized ZrO2 (GA-ZrO2) was
identified by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. GA
stabilization has altered the surface charges of the ZrO2, which enhanced the
dispersion qualities of NPs in aqueous media. The as-prepared GA-ZrO2 NPs were
evaluated for their antibacterial properties toward four strains of oral
bacteria, namely, Rothia mucilaginosa, Rothia dentocariosa, Streptococcus mitis, 
and Streptococcus mutans. GA-ZrO2 exhibited increased antimicrobial activities
compared with pristine ZrO2. This improved activity can be attributed to the
alteration of surface charges of ZrO2 with GA. Consequently, the dispersion
properties of GA-ZrO2 in the aqueous solution have increased considerably, which 
may have enhanced the interactions between the nanomaterial and bacteria.
