An imbalance of homeostasis between the microbial communities and the host system
leads to dysbiosis in oral micro flora. DMTU (1,3-di-m-tolyl-urea) is a
biocompatible compound that was shown to inhibit Streptococcus mutans biofilm by 
inhibiting its communication system (quorum sensing). Here, we hypothesized that 
DMTU is able to inhibit multispecies biofilms. We developed a multispecies oral
biofilm model, comprising an early colonizer Streptococcus gordonii, a bridge
colonizer Fusobacterium nucleatum, and late colonizers Porphyromonas gingivalis
and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. We performed comprehensive
investigations to demonstrate the effect of DMTU on planktonic cells and
biofilms. Our findings showed that DMTU inhibits and disrupts multispecies
biofilms without bactericidal effects. Mechanistic studies revealed a significant
down regulation of biofilm and virulence-related genes in P. gingivalis. Taken
together, our study highlights the potential of DMTU to inhibit polymicrobial
biofilm communities and their virulence.
