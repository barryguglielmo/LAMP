β-glucanases are widely applied in biological control, brewing and feed
industries; however, there are seldom studies of β-glucanases in probiotics.
Here, β-glucanase genes were cloned from Bacillus licheniformis, Lactobacillus
fermentum and L. johnsonii. β-glucanase genes, as blg, lfg and ljg isolated from 
B. licheniformis, L. fermentum and L. johnsonii were prokaryotic expressed to
obtain recombinant strains BL, LF and LJ, respectively. Directed mutations in
these genes were introduced by sequential error-prone PCR. Results showed that
β-glucanase activities in three mutants mblg, mlfg and mljg were 1.94-, 2.72- and
1.29-fold higher than the BL, LF and LJ, respectively. Mutation sites analysis
showed substitutions at Ser370Gly and Leu395Phe in mblg; Arg169His and Asn302Ser 
in mlfg; Val132Met, Ser226Asn, and Asp355Gly in mljg. Spatial structural
predictions revealed the numbers and positions of α-helices and β-strands in the 
three mutants were altered, which might result in β-glucanase activity
increasement. Analysis of β-glucanase properties revealed no significant
differences in the optimal temperatures and pH between mutant and wild-type
strains. However, mlfg and mljg exhibited greater thermal stability at 30-50 ℃
than the wild-type strains, and mblg improved pH stability compared with
wild-type strain. This is the first report about β-glucanase-encoding genes in L.
fermentum and L. johnsonii. These findings provide an efficient way to improve
the activity of β-glucanase.
