A new process for the production of furfuryl alcohol from corncob was constructed
by using deep eutectic solvents and whole cell catalysis in this paper. Firstly, 
the corncob was treated with deep eutectic solvents to convert the xylan into
furfural, and then the pretreated corncob residue was enzymatically hydrolyzed to
obtain a glucose-rich enzymatic hydrolysate, which was used to provide NADH for
Bacillus coagulans NL01 during the process of furfural reduction. The furfural
yield could reach 46% using the selected choline chloride-oxalic acid as
catalysts and corncob as substrate under the optimized catalytic condition at
120 °C for 30 min. The final furfuryl alcohol yield of 20.7% was achieved with
corncob as substrate. Moreover, this catalytic system realized the recycling of
deep eutectic solvents three times, the high-value production of furfuryl
alcohol, and the comprehensive utilization of corncob.
