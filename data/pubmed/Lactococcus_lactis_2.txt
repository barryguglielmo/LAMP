Lactococcus lactis serves as a paradigm organism for the lactic acid bacteria
(LAB). Extensive research into the molecular biology, metabolism and physiology
of several model strains of this species has been fundamental for our
understanding of the LAB. Genomic studies have provided new insights in the
species L. lactis, including the resolution of the genetic basis of its
subspecies division, as well as the control mechanisms involved in the
fine-tuning of growth-rate and energy metabolism. In addition, it has enabled
novel approaches to study lactococcal lifestyle adaptations to the dairy
application environment, including its adjustment to near-zero growth rates that 
are particularly relevant in the context of cheese ripening. This review
highlights various insights in these areas and exemplifies the strength of
combining experimental evolution with functional genomics and bacterial
physiology research to expand our fundamental understanding of the L. lactis
lifestyle under different environmental conditions.
