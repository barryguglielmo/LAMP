# LAMP
Lanugage Automated Machine Learning by Python.<br>
This tool was built for my master's thesis in biotechnology from Harvard University: Extension School. It is a natural language processor (NLP)
that utilizes pytorch, huggingface, and scipy to make predictions of pathogenicity of bacteria 
based off of semantic analysis of scientific abstracts.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip]

```bash
pip install lamp
```

## Usage

```python
from lamp.pipeline import *

lamp_pipeline(**args)
```
